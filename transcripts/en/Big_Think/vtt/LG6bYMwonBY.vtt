00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
<v Speaker 1>In the good old times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people learned how to read and to write.</v>

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>That's no longer sufficient in the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech 21st century.</v>

3
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:18.591
<v Speaker 1>We also need to know how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk and uncertainty and that is what I</v>

4
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>mean with risk savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a simple example.</v>

5
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>You hear on the where's the report could</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a 30% chance of rain tomorrow,</v>

6
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>30% chains of what now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I live in Berlin and most Belinda's</v>

7
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>believe that it means that it will rain</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 30% of the time.</v>

8
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>That is seven to eight hours as a think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will rain in 30% of the region.</v>

9
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Most New Yorkers belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all nonsense.</v>

10
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>It means it will rain on 30% of the days</v>
<v Speaker 1>for rich.</v>

11
00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>This prediction has been made that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely not at all.</v>

12
00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Many psychologists think that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't learn how to deal with risk,</v>

13
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>but in this case it's the experts do</v>
<v Speaker 1>meteorologists.</v>

14
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>We have not learned how to communicate</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk in an understandable way.</v>

15
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:24.741
<v Speaker 1>That is to say to what class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 30% refers time or region or days.</v>

16
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>And if you have some imagination you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of what other classes.</v>

17
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one woman in New York said,</v>

18
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I know what 30% means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three meteorologist think it rains and</v>

19
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>seven not now getting soaked isn't minor</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk,</v>

20
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'll be risk savvy when it comes to</v>
<v Speaker 1>more important things.</v>

21
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 year olds drive,</v>

22
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>we still cell phone glued to their ears</v>
<v Speaker 1>not realizing that the decrees,</v>

23
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>their reaction time to that of a 70 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>old or many Americans,</v>

24
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>about 20% believe that they are in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top 1% income group and as many believed</v>

25
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.730
<v Speaker 1>it will be soon be there or take health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So about an estimated 1 million children</v>

26
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>get every year unnecessary computed</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomography.</v>

27
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.290
<v Speaker 1>CT scans</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnecessary because they're not really</v>

28
00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>clinically indicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not just a waste of time but</v>

29
00:02:36.211 --> 00:02:41.211
<v Speaker 1>also danger to the kids because a ct</v>
<v Speaker 1>scan can have the radiation of a hundred</v>

30
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.221
<v Speaker 1>chest x rays and may lead in a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of these kids later to cancer.</v>

31
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>We deal everyday with risks but we</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't learned how to understand them.</v>

32
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is not simple in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human mind,</v>

33
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 1>but also in experts who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know what the risks are or don't</v>

34
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>know how to communicate them or in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>

35
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.010
<v Speaker 1>like if it's about finance or health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have interests other than yours.</v>

36
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 1>So the key message you stays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone can learn to deal with risks.</v>

37
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone can learn to ask the question,</v>

38
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>probability of what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

39
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.320
<v Speaker 1>if you believe that are safe by young</v>
<v Speaker 1>delegating the responsibility of your</v>

40
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:43.501
<v Speaker 1>Wilson and health to experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you may be disappointed because</v>

41
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>many experts</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not know how to communicate</v>

42
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 1>probabilities or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.370
<v Speaker 1>tried to protect themselves against you</v>
<v Speaker 1>as in health care as a potential</v>

44
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>plaintiff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to think yourself.</v>

45
00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>And that's the key message.</v>
