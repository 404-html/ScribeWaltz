1
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand idea is that the brand is</v>

2
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>going to sum up all of your experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the product.</v>

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just the logo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the logo is part of it.</v>

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be be helpful for me to</v>

5
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>back up and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>the way I look at habits forming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this concept of what I say</v>

7
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>contacts q training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforcement.</v>

8
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>So the context is that within a specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

9
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>this is how I'm doing a particular thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that context is really important.</v>

10
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>if you think about the context of music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the morning you may wake up to um,</v>

12
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a radio playing music,</v>

13
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>your local radio station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may then go to an Ipod,</v>

14
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>in your head when you go for your run in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning,</v>

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.030
<v Speaker 1>you get in a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may listen to satellite radio,</v>

17
00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>you may listen to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may listen to talk radio on the way</v>

19
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>and you may listen to traffic.</v>

20
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>Each of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about music,</v>

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>but the context changes how you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to access it.</v>

22
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the thing that within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>context you want to be able to help your</v>

23
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>customers simplify their decisions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about making good,</v>

24
00:01:09.811 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>simple decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for a brand to serve that role,</v>

25
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:19.041
<v Speaker 1>then you have to really identify how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand allows you to automate a decision.</v>

26
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I just,</v>

27
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:21.781
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

28
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Campbell soup to have in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my pantry,</v>

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>because there are times when you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to solve that problem.</v>

31
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering fix lunch for the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to just fix them a cold</v>

32
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:33.511
<v Speaker 1>sandwich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

33
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>hot soup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I feel like I'm a good parent because</v>

34
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there may be a lot of complexity,</v>

35
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>there might be a lot of stuff involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it,</v>

36
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>but it all gets summarized and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's brand and that color and</v>

37
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

38
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it can be so powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for a brand you know,</v>

39
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>that you knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see why,</v>

40
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>what the challenges because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>history there.</v>

41
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a lot of work to do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're advertising and in and getting</v>

42
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>people aware and then getting people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand when they should use you.</v>

43
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about how many websites there</v>

44
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about how many news sources</v>

45
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>how do I get somebody to come to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>website?</v>

47
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And the key here is I've got to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>

48
00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I've got to do something repeatedly</v>
<v Speaker 1>before my brain can kind of lay down the</v>

49
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:24.051
<v Speaker 1>tracks that automate that process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's that idea of focusing on</v>

50
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.070
<v Speaker 1>behavior versus attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so fundamental in terms of our</v>

51
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>understanding of how the brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're before advertisers and</v>

52
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>marketers were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really focused on trying to get you to</v>

53
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>have a particular belief or a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>

54
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>What my contention is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much more important that I get to</v>

55
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>behavior because when you talk about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that customer satisfaction doesn't</v>

56
00:02:48.841 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>predict behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

57
00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>85 percent of people who leave a one</v>
<v Speaker 1>product for another report being</v>

58
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with the ones that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving.</v>

59
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:58.811 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>if I'm satisfying them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why do I measure it?</v>

61
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>Why do I care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seems kind of unfair.</v>

62
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a great job.</v>

63
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>I satisfied them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't they staying?</v>

64
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers that,</v>

65
00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfaction doesn't really isn't,</v>

66
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>is a conscious concept and a lot of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making is unconscious.</v>

67
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.320
<v Speaker 1>So a great example of this is the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>people watch television now.</v>

68
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>We used to get TV guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>We used to like plan out what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to watch and then plan our time to</v>

70
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>be in front of a television and now what</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do.</v>

71
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the numbers are really staggering.</v>

72
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>It's really surprising is they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is they have no idea what they're going</v>

73
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They sit down,</v>

74
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.050
<v Speaker 1>they pick up the remote and the remote</v>
<v Speaker 1>now has these digital guides and they</v>

75
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>flip through and they look what's on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a total different.</v>

76
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at no point did someone go,</v>

77
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously I've decided that I no</v>

78
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>longer want to orient myself around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>television schedule.</v>

79
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>When I get in front of the TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll look to see what's on the point</v>

80
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>here is that's the way we learn a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of is this unconscious learning</v>

81
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>that we do from these complex feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms that we get from the</v>

82
00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so often companies fail miserably to</v>

83
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>really understand how people are making</v>
<v Speaker 1>these decisions.</v>
