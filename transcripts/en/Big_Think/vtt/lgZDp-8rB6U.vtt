1
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberately developmental organization</v>

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>is first of all a mouthful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we call it a Ddo for short.</v>

3
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of an answer to the question.</v>

4
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>If an organization's so valued</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing the capabilities of its</v>

5
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>people that would want to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that could immersively gather</v>

6
00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>every member of that culture into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ongoing developmental,</v>

7
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>personal kind of learning journey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would that,</v>

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture look like?</v>

9
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>What would such an organization look</v>
<v Speaker 1>lark?</v>

10
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.903
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>that's what we set out to discover and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 1>in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>what we learned is that in the ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

14
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>most people are doing a second job that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's paying them for.</v>

15
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>That second job has to do with looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

16
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>hiding their weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>covering their inadequacies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing other people's favorable</v>

18
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>impressions of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say that's a human nature.</v>

19
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>it also turns out to be incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>costly in ways that we don't think</v>

21
00:01:18.401 --> 00:01:19.234
<v Speaker 1>enough about.</v>

22
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 1>If I keep hiding my weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood that I'm going to</v>

23
00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>overcome them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>shrinks to near zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

25
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organization has to keep,</v>

26
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm paying for the consequences of my</v>

27
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

28
00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're paying me a full time salary for</v>

29
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>part time work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine an organization where people</v>

30
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>would feel safe enough that they would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.210
<v Speaker 1>they would kind of consider they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>hired not because anybody thought they</v>

32
00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:54.820
<v Speaker 1>were perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because people thought they were</v>

33
00:01:54.821 --> 00:01:59.821
<v Speaker 1>good and that they could learn and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one of their jobs there,</v>

34
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

35
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>to learn and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you get actually supported for,</v>

36
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revealing your mistakes.</v>

37
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And you could say the kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of an entrepreneurial</v>

38
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>stance toward people development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

39
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the watchword of entrepreneurial ism is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to avoid failure,</v>

40
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:24.790
<v Speaker 1>but to fail frequently at to fail fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to fail forward.</v>

41
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.040
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a culture where people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraged to do that so that they</v>

42
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:32.140
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep learning and getting better.</v>

43
00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 1>And then you would be imagining a Ddo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deliberately developmental</v>

44
00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.140
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think another really important feature</v>

45
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>of these cultures that anyone would</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly notice if you spent a little</v>

46
00:02:45.821 --> 00:02:50.821
<v Speaker 1>time in them is a kind of transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way in which,</v>

47
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

48
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 1>and often the way they'll say it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am who I am at work.</v>

49
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

50
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not living a divided life.</v>

51
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>This is what we mean by this notion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ordinary organizations,</v>

52
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>we're all doing a second job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to look good.</v>

53
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>We're always trying to kind of be at our</v>
<v Speaker 1>best,</v>

54
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these organizations.</v>

55
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that quickly gets seen as a way of</v>

56
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>essentially avoiding one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>precious and valuable things that the</v>

57
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 1>culture has to offer you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the opportunity to just be the</v>

58
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>same person at work that you are when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not at work.</v>

59
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>the good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>

61
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:49.771
<v Speaker 1>and what you might think is the ugly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bridgewater talks about this as a</v>

62
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>radical transparency and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that,</v>

63
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ordinary,</v>

64
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>ordinary organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody agrees it's unprofessional to</v>

65
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>talk critically about people behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>their backs and everybody participates</v>

66
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of you listening right now are</v>

67
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't do that.</v>

68
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not be a speaker,</v>

69
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.330
<v Speaker 1>but I bet you've been a listener to such</v>
<v Speaker 1>communications and you didn't say to the</v>

70
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.400
<v Speaker 1>other person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unprofessional and wrong</v>

71
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>for you to be talking about Ralph to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind his back.</v>

72
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>So one way or the other passively or</v>
<v Speaker 1>actively,</v>

73
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>we have all participated in what we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be unprofessional behavior</v>

74
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>in bridgewater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no back to be behind.</v>

75
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

76
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>because hold on to your hats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In every office and in every meeting</v>

77
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's tape recording equipment and</v>

78
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>every conversation is being tape</v>
<v Speaker 1>recorded.</v>

79
00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Not in a creepy NSA a kind of way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I'm having a conversation,</v>

80
00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you report to me and I'm having a</v>

81
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>conversation with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had the conversation about you</v>

82
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>with my boss and you're not in the room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've now been talking about you.</v>

83
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to fair through a 400</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapes and see if somebody mentioned your</v>

84
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:24.790
<v Speaker 1>name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an obligation,</v>

85
00:05:24.791 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 1>send you an email and let you know you</v>
<v Speaker 1>were discussed.</v>

86
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this meeting,</v>

87
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at such and such a time on such and such</v>

88
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feel free if you want to listen to the</v>

89
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 1>tape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's absolutely,</v>

90
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I know it drives people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get very struck,</v>

92
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by this.</v>

93
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just one of a number of features</v>

95
00:05:50.771 --> 00:05:55.771
<v Speaker 1>that quickly give you the sense we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a whole different way of</v>

96
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:57.310
<v Speaker 1>being at work.</v>

97
00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
