00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>The thing we should do with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>create art that have done terrible</v>

2
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:14.391
<v Speaker 1>things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you found out as I head of Johnson</v>

3
00:00:15.691 --> 00:00:20.691
<v Speaker 1>and Johnson was a serial rapist that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody at Johnson and Johnson knew</v>

4
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>one way or another,</v>

6
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.470

<v Speaker 1>to do?</v>

7
00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:34.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>For you.</v>

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Within the construct of society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the raping and killing of women,</v>

10
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>there's a channel called Id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's devoted to 24 hours a day of</v>

11
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>sexualizing murder victims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

12

<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop it.</v>

13
00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:50.600

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.440
<v Speaker 1>That's my message is knock it off when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to like woody Allen.</v>

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

16
00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>huge loss for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that compares to the girl who's</v>

17
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>just been raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That now feels like she wants to hang</v>

18
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>herself from her balcony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

19
00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Cause that really balances out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people bitch about that.</v>

20
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomber for you,</v>

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't watch birth of a nation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>

22
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Probably not because you know it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist.</v>

23
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>So in time these people will be looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>at like that.</v>

24
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 1>My job and other jobs at work in kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm doing is to put an asterisks</v>

25
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:28.331
<v Speaker 1>next to these assholes names for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and if people want to cry about not</v>

26
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>getting into like somebody they liked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their kids</v>

27
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>will get a fucking bigger problem.</v>

28
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not that complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People really not.</v>

29
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>It's really not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

30
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Read a different book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

31
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I have so many people fighting me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they want to stay in the system.</v>

32
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>The system benefits a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero,</v>

33
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.771
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

34
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ultimate goal is smashing the 99 in</v>

35
00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>the one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm here for.</v>

36
00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm here to do that through thought and</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising women up and yes,</v>

37
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:11.140
<v Speaker 1>in in children of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cult I was born into and again it</v>

38
00:02:11.141 --> 00:02:11.701
<v Speaker 1>seems like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

39
00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>they make a big deal of the cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My.</v>

40
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>I would be talking about Ohio if that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to be my life.</v>

41
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:19.350
<v Speaker 1>That just was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a cult too and I think you</v>

42
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>all know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

43
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:21.961
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

44
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird how you grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's weird how you live and I</v>

45
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>think it's tragic because by 10 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of free minds,</v>

46
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>they're out there for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to be vigilant.</v>

47
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 1>What if those 10 percent of the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you look at as the Weirdos in the</v>

48
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>fringe people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if it's you guys,</v>

49
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

50
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>just like how African Americans have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been saying.</v>

51
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>I remember hearing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading about it when I was 13,</v>

52
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they get killed when they get</v>

53
00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:53.460
<v Speaker 1>pulled over by cops and that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a saint maybe because someone said</v>

54
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>that to me in Germany recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said this is like kind of what a woman</v>

55
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said maybe waving his hand.</v>

56
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I thought we have like a trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trillion phds in me,</v>

57
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:06.311
<v Speaker 1>a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

58
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Because we're in our skin and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's sad is because when you get sold</v>

59
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>as an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other side thinks that's what you</v>

60
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.110
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they were.</v>

61
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's responding to us primarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an idea that's sold stamps or</v>

62
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>imagery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Know Adam Sandler movies where you</v>

63
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>have sell my at Jessica Biel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Kate Beckinsale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these accomplished women with Adam</v>

65
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Sandler are Slovenly slog who shtick is</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing dirty pants and,</v>

66
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>and basically having a two point two Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the message they send out as you</v>

67
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:43.921
<v Speaker 1>deserve this and that directly with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those young boys watching leads to the</v>

68
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.520
<v Speaker 1>idea of undeserved there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

69
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>you actually deserve a complex women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only if you two can match that.</v>

70
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>During World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each studio had served their rank.</v>

71
00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>They served in the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their rank was ministers of propaganda</v>

72
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.700
<v Speaker 1>and they came to them after the war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

73
00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 1>holy crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women are out in the kitchen.</v>

74
00:04:06.651 --> 00:04:11.030
<v Speaker 1>Why get back in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when we started seeing Doris</v>

75
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 1>Day like overdrive vacuuming every ease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we put video with sound images with</v>

76
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.620
<v Speaker 1>sound really taken a fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you notice how fast the destruction</v>

77
00:04:21.621 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>of the world is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know tying things together,</v>

78
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.931
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

79
00:04:23.931 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>it can't be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be responsible for all of that.</v>

80
00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.493
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Karen,</v>

81
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.510
<v Speaker 1>it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really can.</v>

82
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>There's that two year old on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That video that went around,</v>

83
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>he's punching along with rocky</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone's like,</v>

84
00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.690
<v Speaker 1>isn't that cute?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No little timmy.</v>

85
00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:41.870
<v Speaker 1>There's just been stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've just stolen what he is and when</v>

86
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about also you're telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>them what a man is.</v>

87
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:46.940
<v Speaker 1>Just especially telling them what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>white man is and especially you're</v>

88
00:04:46.941 --> 00:04:49.410
<v Speaker 1>telling them how to feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are sports so popular?</v>

89
00:04:49.411 --> 00:04:51.290
<v Speaker 1>They're stupid country in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

90
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Because here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how men are.</v>

91
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>The only time traditionally they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to have an expression of energy</v>

92
00:04:59.301 --> 00:05:02.630
<v Speaker 1>or a release of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately it's an anger and</v>

93
00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:06.050
<v Speaker 1>aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

94
00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.540
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real western societal interest,</v>

95
00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.570
<v Speaker 1>so real American problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm worse than any other place I've</v>

96
00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:15.390
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a lot of places and I think</v>

97
00:05:15.391 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>when you come from a land more time</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind it,</v>

98
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.210
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>America keeps going.</v>

99
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>We're so young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No or not white people are yelling to</v>

100
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had dummies.</v>

101
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Greg's not young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just renamed it.</v>

102
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.530
<v Speaker 1>You know what they did in the twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought this was the height of a</v>

103
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.590
<v Speaker 1>American Hubris that gave native</v>
<v Speaker 1>American citizenship if Indians</v>

104
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.720
<v Speaker 1>citizenship and call them names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

105
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>Like that's the mentality we're dealing</v>
<v Speaker 1>with and they fight it on every level</v>

106
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>they fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want the Redskins logo off this.</v>

107
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.400
<v Speaker 1>I won't shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shut up.</v>

108
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Wham.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sports team is sad now.</v>

109
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traditional shaming thing,</v>

110
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.320
<v Speaker 1>what have we done since Hester Brian</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on and like,</v>

111
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>since you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

112
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>someone called Mary in the Bible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did the same thing to me that they</v>

113
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>did to marry every interview is what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>man should it.</v>

114
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>So I understood that detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funneling and the system of how we</v>

115
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.160
<v Speaker 1>sell ideas to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to understand it's not just</v>

116
00:06:14.161 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>the immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like how my family treated me</v>

117
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>based on coverage because they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestling with.</v>

118
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>They kind of know me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they think they know any more from</v>

119
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>what they see in the media because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they say.</v>

120
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Same with any man or woman that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever been with.</v>

121
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends,</v>

122
00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.970
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affected everything it was,</v>

123
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but the prison wasn't mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

124
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.801
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:06:39.801 --> 00:06:42.560
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're actually behind bars,</v>

126
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>those bars aren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we think they are as a.</v>

127
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on Stephen Colbert last night and</v>

128
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about I was wearing a</v>

129
00:06:50.931 --> 00:06:51.561
<v Speaker 1>hoodie and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

130
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could wear that hat to wear the</v>
<v Speaker 1>suit,</v>

131
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.630
<v Speaker 1>because I was saying I hate suits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like whenever I wear them.</v>

132
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking maybe men are cranky</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this,</v>

133
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>because you're like a t rex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hands are like,</v>

134
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 1>you can't move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fun.</v>

135
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uncomfortable and men don't like to</v>

136
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>be uncomfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like itchy things.</v>

137
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Understandably so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That suit paradigms stupid.</v>

138
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:11.271
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

139
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:12.920
<v Speaker 1>what would happen to you if you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear a suit?</v>

140
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:14.510
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to wear a suit just for as long</v>

141
00:07:14.511 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why?</v>

142
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>And he actually said at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about it after,</v>

143
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the camera cut and like kind of</v>

144
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>wonder why do I have to wear a suit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who says,</v>

145
00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>who made that rule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>

146
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 1>They also made the rule that it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>indiscriminate and okay to rape and</v>

147
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 1>sexually assault in Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also time to stop that and the</v>

148
00:07:37.161 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a run on sentence.</v>
