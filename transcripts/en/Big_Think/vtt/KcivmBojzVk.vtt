00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask one of the most embarrassing and</v>

2
00:00:06.621 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>deepest theological questions at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>merger at the,</v>

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>at the area where physics and philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>collide at the present time.</v>

4
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>We can only teleport photons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles of light,</v>

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.320
<v Speaker 1>and Adam's like caesium in rubidium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it for the present time.</v>

6
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the coming years,</v>

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>we do expect to be able to teleport</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules,</v>

8
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>maybe water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbon dioxide after that,</v>

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even Dna,</v>

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe organic molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

11
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.020
<v Speaker 1>to teleport a human raises all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical questions that you mentioned</v>

12
00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>because the original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

13
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:47.840
<v Speaker 1>it has to be destroyed in the process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum teleportation.</v>

14
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>So if you get captain Kirk Zap them</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the room,</v>

15
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>you have now seen captain Kirk die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen this.</v>

16
00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Adam's fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's this other Captain Clark on</v>

17
00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>the other side of the room who has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same bad jokes,</v>

18
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.860
<v Speaker 1>who has the same character?</v>

19
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 1>All the personality quirks as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original Captain Kirk.</v>

20
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.920
<v Speaker 1>So the imposter says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

21
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the memories,</v>

22
00:01:11.931 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>the personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the courts,</v>

23
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am captain Kirk.</v>

24
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just saw the original die and if you</v>

25
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>believe in a soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that soul went to heaven or maybe the</v>

26
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 1>other place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that person is dead.</v>

27
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>So who is this imposter over there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the imposter have a soul?</v>

28
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>So it raises the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we nothing but information is the</v>

29
00:01:33.531 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>soul the essence of who we are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but information.</v>

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a physicist.</v>

31
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the answer to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All we're saying is it is physically</v>

32
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>possible to teleport and entire human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being across the room or maybe onto</v>

33
00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is physically possible to do that.</v>

34
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>And it raises a valid question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to the soul?</v>

35
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.280
<v Speaker 1>If you original copy died and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there has all your memories,</v>

36
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 2>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is we don't know.</v>
