00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>The medical model that might begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about this problem based model is,</v>

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.880
<v Speaker 1>is really restricted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>it's very powerful and it helps us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

4
00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>but it only takes us so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental nature of dying is not</v>

5
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>medical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's personal.</v>

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:32.341
<v Speaker 1>dying cannot be encompassed by a set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical problems and a set of diagnoses</v>

8
00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 1>and treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>so while we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we can,</v>

10
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>can remain disease focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.250
<v Speaker 1>for as long as it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have to attend to the personal</v>

12
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>aspects of dying of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:48.611 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

14
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>what you lose and dying in the hospital</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times is you lose that personal</v>

15
00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your,</v>

16
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your space is not your own people walk</v>

17
00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:59.450
<v Speaker 1>in and out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the sort of privacy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimacy with family.</v>

19
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that though we stayed within that</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical model.</v>

20
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.770
<v Speaker 1>Everybody who walks in your room or</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacts with you are talking to you</v>

21
00:01:11.771 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>about medical problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will continue to conscript your</v>

22
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>attention to the lab tests and the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.970
<v Speaker 1>scans and the next treatments and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and your vital signs and all of</v>

24
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>instead of attending to the personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually conscript your time and</v>

26
00:01:31.151 --> 00:01:36.151
<v Speaker 1>energy for the medical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best end of life care that I know of</v>

27
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>through modeled by hospice programs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best palliative care programs</v>

28
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>still does all the medical stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's subordinated to the personal.</v>

29
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.523
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hospice care,</v>

31
00:01:49.151 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 1>we make appointments to see you and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>family and not the other way around.</v>

32
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>We're coming to your home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

33
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.993
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>explicitly acknowledging the importance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Interactions,</v>

35
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your privacy and intimacy.</v>

36
00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And beyond that we're even offering some</v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

37
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:16.441
<v Speaker 1>some guidance that may be a value to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this area of,</v>

38
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>of human interaction.</v>

39
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>I would call life completion in life</v>
<v Speaker 1>closure,</v>

40
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>

41
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.360
<v Speaker 1>in a problem based medical model doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even exist.</v>

42
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not their quality of life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of life completion really exists</v>

43
00:02:34.601 --> 00:02:38.020
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a developmental model that really</v>

44
00:02:38.021 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>honors the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breadth of human life for the person</v>

45
00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

46
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>but not in a problem based model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even the very best of of a problem</v>

47
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:52.981
<v Speaker 1>based medicine and including attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to symptoms in the like tends not to see</v>

48
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:58.000
<v Speaker 1>those personal experiences of completing</v>
<v Speaker 1>one's affairs,</v>

49
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>fiscal and legal and project related</v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs,</v>

50
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:03.790
<v Speaker 1>but also their personal affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

51
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.240
<v Speaker 1>their relationships and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>explorations of the own meaning and</v>

52
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>significance of their own life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their relationship to something larger</v>

53
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>than themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff that's not abstract for</v>

54
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>people who know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their life is measured in weeks or</v>

55
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

56
00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>it's very tangible.</v>
