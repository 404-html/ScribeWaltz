1
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was incredibly unjust because they</v>

2
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>had a hundred to one ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

3
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:20.211
<v Speaker 1>if you had a one gram of cocaine powder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>if you had 100th the amount of crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>that those would be considered equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that crack cocaine typically</v>

6
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>has been associated with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>communities that are lower income,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor people.</v>

8
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Whereas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.963
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties in Aspen,</v>

11
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>people aren't smoking crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it did have a,</v>

12
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>a horror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific effect.</v>

13
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on population.</v>

14
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I do federal criminal work and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of,</v>

15
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people with face horrific</v>

16
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:58.530
<v Speaker 1>sentencing because of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 1>their involvement with the crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>cocaine,</v>

18
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe on a very superficial level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the way the sentencing</v>

19
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.750
<v Speaker 1>guidelines were structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing as a small case.</v>

20
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.711
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>they would have to have a hundred times</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as the equivalent amount of</v>

22
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>crack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from what I've learned that,</v>

23
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to convert powder cocaine to crack,</v>

24
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a one to one basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you were in the federal system,</v>

25
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:31.491
<v Speaker 1>it's insidious enough that if there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>proof that you intended to convert,</v>

26
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:35.880
<v Speaker 1>say 50 grams of powder into 50 grams of</v>
<v Speaker 1>crack,</v>

27
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>it would be treated at the hundred to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one ratio.</v>

28
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno if anybody anybody's destined to</v>

30
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>be to for the criminal justice system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you grow up in an area of low</v>

31
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>income where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>where most many people are not working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there is,</v>

33
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>there's not much employment where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot of,</v>

34
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidance.</v>

35
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Inevitably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of opportunities to</v>

37
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.590
<v Speaker 1>become involved in criminal activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also in the,</v>

38
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lower income communities,</v>

39
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.710
<v Speaker 1>people are more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more likely to resolve disputes</v>

40
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:27.711
<v Speaker 1>simply by dialing nine one one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And police are more predisposed to just</v>

41
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 1>simply arresting people rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to resolve an issue or see if the</v>

42
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:38.281
<v Speaker 1>issue really requires an arrest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see a tremendous amount of people</v>

43
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.961
<v Speaker 1>that in other communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wouldn't have been the opportunity</v>

44
00:02:45.481 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>to get in crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

45
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>things that they do would not have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated as a crime.</v>

46
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the fact that that's the way</v>

47
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>the police handle things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and people are very,</v>

49
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy to dial nine one one to</v>

50
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.131
<v Speaker 3>resolve a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

51
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.550
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a,</v>

52
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>the funding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funding programs to,</v>

53
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.480
<v Speaker 1>help addiction education programs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop people from becoming involved in a</v>

55
00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>substance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 1>substance abuse situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>job training,</v>

57
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.030
<v Speaker 1>people that are working are far less</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be come involved,</v>

58
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in crime.</v>

59
00:03:40.021 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take things too to support</v>

60
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:48.081
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of money would be</v>

61
00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:52.740
<v Speaker 1>better spent before people get into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal justice system.</v>

62
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Then now we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we spend the most amount of money.</v>

63
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.750
<v Speaker 1>And when I say we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about government in,</v>

64
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.730
<v Speaker 1>in building presence to simply warehouse</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

65
00:04:02.731 --> 00:04:03.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>this country has more people in jail</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any other,</v>

67
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

68
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.420
<v Speaker 3>Per capita than any country in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

69
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty horrific.</v>

70
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still am loath to sort of to say that</v>

71
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.880
<v Speaker 1>someone that's committed a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they've gone to prison,</v>

72
00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:29.390
<v Speaker 1>that they're going to be like anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else because they're still individuals.</v>

73
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.050
<v Speaker 1>So I think it really depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.740
<v Speaker 1>there's no rehabilitation as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>rehabilitation education.</v>

75
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little is spent on that.</v>

76
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Most of the money for corrections is</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent on,</v>

77
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection and,</v>

78
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really making sure people don't</v>

79
00:04:55.521 --> 00:04:59.390
<v Speaker 1>escape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have engage in violence with other</v>

80
00:04:59.391 --> 00:05:03.050
<v Speaker 1>inmates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's not a lot done to see that</v>

81
00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 1>when people get out that they won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeat those behaviors.</v>

82
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.510
<v Speaker 1>But I still think it depends on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

83
00:05:08.511 --> 00:05:11.120
<v Speaker 1>If they're coming out and they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>supportive family,</v>

84
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably have a shot.</v>

85
00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.860
<v Speaker 1>If they're coming out to nothing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they had an extensive criminal</v>

86
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:22.190
<v Speaker 1>history beforehand and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to the neighborhood where they've</v>

87
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>gotten arrested and prosecuted</v>

88
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.330
<v Speaker 3>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a little hope that</v>

89
00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:31.340
<v Speaker 3>they're going to turn their entire life</v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

90
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.990
<v Speaker 3>I think towards if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

91
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 3>if towards the end of people</v>

92
00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know in,</v>

93
00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the federal system,</v>

94
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:46.160
<v Speaker 1>depending on what crime you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>convicted of,</v>

95
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.980
<v Speaker 1>they release people to halfway houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>and conditionally released people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they get some sort of job skills or</v>

97
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be something other than</v>

98
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>sitting in a cell for 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then on the day that your schedule</v>

99
00:06:01.581 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>of the release,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they simply open the door for you and</v>

100
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>give you your clothes that you came in</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

101
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.510
<v Speaker 1>If there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.960
<v Speaker 1>one would hope that towards the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentencing,</v>

103
00:06:11.961 --> 00:06:16.961
<v Speaker 1>some effort is made to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to match that individual up with some</v>

104
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.841
<v Speaker 1>sort of preparation for the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside cause the world.</v>

105
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it different from being in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>from their experience in being</v>
<v Speaker 1>incarcerated,</v>

107
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>but the world is different from when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went in.</v>

108
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
