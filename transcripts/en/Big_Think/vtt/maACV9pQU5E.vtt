1
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Vascular separate things here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is that I argue in the book that the</v>

2
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>ride versus</v>

3
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 2>laughed way of looking at American</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics is very obsolete.</v>

4
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>That in fact there are many positions</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to be called or considered</v>

5
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 2>leftwing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which impact on us in the center of</v>

6
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 2>American politics and very mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bring the troops home from Iraq,</v>

7
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 2>a universal healthcare and doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>something about corporate</v>

8
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 2>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global warming.</v>

9
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 2>All these issues are now mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was 60 to 70 percent approval ratings.</v>

10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 2>So the meeting he had continued to</v>
<v Speaker 2>deposit this false dichotomy of right</v>

11
00:00:52.081 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 2>versus left on practically every</v>
<v Speaker 2>political issue.</v>

12
00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>And the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other problem is that when you look</v>

13
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>at the facts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the evidence,</v>

14
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 2>it is not so difficult to realize where</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth lies.</v>

15
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.670
<v Speaker 2>Then we can have a vigorous discussion</v>
<v Speaker 2>about how to approach the problem or</v>

16
00:01:13.861 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

17
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 2>but whether I'm there is global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether evolution is the fact whoever</v>

18
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>Iraq is a catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a pretty clear answers.</v>
