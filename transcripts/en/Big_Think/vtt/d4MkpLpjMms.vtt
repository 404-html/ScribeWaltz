00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>

2
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you shoot with models,</v>

4
00:00:12.561 --> 00:00:15.380
<v Speaker 2>they're professionals and they're paid</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be there.</v>

5
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so they,</v>

6
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 2>they typically are trained to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>direction and they're a natural</v>

7
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 2>extroverts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you deal with celebrities,</v>

8
00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:31.901
<v Speaker 2>you tend to deal a lot more with a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a tendency to be introverted says</v>

9
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.000
<v Speaker 2>at least in front of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 2>the still camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then typically celebrities are not</v>

11
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 2>all that comfortable being photographed</v>
<v Speaker 2>because in reality they're out of</v>

12
00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:42.340
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 2>that the level of their performance is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

14
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 2>very different from that which they</v>
<v Speaker 2>express on a,</v>

15
00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>onto the motion picture experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

16
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't control when the shutter a is</v>

17
00:00:58.131 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 2>being depressed and what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 2>what image comes out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they tend to be a little,</v>

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm self conscious of that experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

20
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the role of a portrait photography is to</v>

21
00:01:09.321 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 2>really be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 2>to either exploit that vulnerability or</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

23
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or to release it somehow and to get</v>

24
00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:19.850
<v Speaker 2>something out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

25
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:20.601
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

26
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be a tricky experience and it's</v>

27
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 2>always an adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

28
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 2>very unique to</v>

29
00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorable,</v>

30
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 2>all of the experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

31
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are subjects that people,</v>

32
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who I've photographed multiple times and</v>

33
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>have had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great experience.</v>

34
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 2>Shootings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

35
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 2>and with that comes to mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sandra bullock who have shot multiple</v>

36
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 2>times and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 2>Kate Bosworth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

38
00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.990
<v Speaker 2>and Orlando Bloom of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

39
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 2>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

40
00:01:56.921 --> 00:02:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I've had similar experiences where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Philip Seymour Hoffman,</v>

41
00:02:00.311 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 2>which sort of stands as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.150
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very stoic and very,</v>

43
00:02:07.151 --> 00:02:07.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

44
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 2>but portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

45
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it somehow feels like with some</v>

46
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>people you really get a photograph and</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel that,</v>

47
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps with some,</v>

48
00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:19.810
<v Speaker 2>like people might look at it a 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30,</v>

49
00:02:19.811 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 2>50 years from now.</v>
