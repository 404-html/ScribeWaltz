1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.943
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I think Eddie artist's responsibility is</v>
<v Speaker 2>first and foremost to create good art</v>

3
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 2>and I think hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not the first to say this,</v>

4
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 2>probably not the first to say this on</v>
<v Speaker 2>big thing,</v>

5
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 2>but hip hop has always been held to</v>
<v Speaker 2>standards that I thought were</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
<v Speaker 2>unrealistic and unfair and standards</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no other modern pop music forum has</v>

7
00:00:31.501 --> 00:00:36.501
<v Speaker 2>been held to as far as the our lyrical</v>
<v Speaker 2>contents and how much we deliver a</v>

8
00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:42.561
<v Speaker 2>substantive message or whether we craft</v>
<v Speaker 2>our music into a comprehensive handbook</v>

9
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 2>for how to live your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think anyone has ever looked at</v>
<v Speaker 2>blues or jazz or country or any other</v>

11
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 2>form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has ever looked at John Coltrane</v>

12
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 2>and said he's failing as an artist</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't provide a detailed</v>

13
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 2>blueprint for political change in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>country or a detailed blueprint for how</v>

14
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 2>to raise your children.</v>

15
00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because people recognize that the value</v>

16
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 2>of John Coltrane's music comes in its</v>
<v Speaker 2>musical expressiveness.</v>

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 2>But with hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people don't recognize hip</v>

18
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 2>hop's musical value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they latch onto what's easier for</v>

19
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>them to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is the lyrical content and judging</v>

20
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 2>strictly on that basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think hip hop gets a raw deal in a</v>

21
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 2>lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially because right when hip hop</v>

22
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 2>was beginning to be discovered by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainstream.</v>

23
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 2>It was right towards the end of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>people call a conscious era with groups</v>

24
00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:37.911
<v Speaker 2>like public enemy who raised hopes very</v>
<v Speaker 2>high for having this generation fill the</v>

25
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 2>void that had been left behind when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil rights movement ended.</v>

26
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the black power era had ended due to</v>

27
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 2>cointelpro and self implosion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever else went on.</v>

28
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people were hoping for some kind</v>

29
00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 2>of voice to rise up and when you had</v>
<v Speaker 2>public enemy and all the other groups</v>

30
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:59.541
<v Speaker 2>around him speaking so compellingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people got their hopes so high</v>

31
00:01:59.611 --> 00:02:02.610
<v Speaker 2>that they get really unrealistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations for how much these young</v>

32
00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 2>musicians could really deliver.</v>

33
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.920
<v Speaker 2>As far as offering substantive social</v>
<v Speaker 2>and political leadership.</v>

34
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

35
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>working in sort of a left wing</v>

36
00:02:13.441 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 2>progressive circle of nonprofit media</v>
<v Speaker 2>has always been a struggle for me to get</v>

37
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 2>people to recognize that hip hop should</v>
<v Speaker 2>be recognized for his musical value</v>

38
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 2>first and foremost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we're making great music,</v>

39
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 2>then we did our jobs and if we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>expressing something that's explicitly</v>

40
00:02:29.431 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 2>political or positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's great,</v>

41
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 2>but that's icing on the cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have the foundation of</v>

42
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 2>great music underneath that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

43
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter if it was all about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the message and only the message.</v>

44
00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Cornell West would be the best rapper in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

45
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 2>which I'm sure he would agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
