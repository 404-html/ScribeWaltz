00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should be asking</v>

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 2>selves what are their constraints and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I use just a,</v>

3
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 2>a part of that to tackle a problem</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's always bothered me,</v>

4
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>that will help somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how can I take that small step?</v>

5
00:00:22.851 --> 00:00:26.660
<v Speaker 2>What car should I join?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the next thing that needs to be</v>

6
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 2>solved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how can I get some satisfaction from</v>

7
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:32.540
<v Speaker 2>doing it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you don't get the</v>

8
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 2>satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't pure altruism.</v>

9
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>If you don't get the satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to keep on doing it.</v>

10
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 2>So what can I find that with truly give</v>
<v Speaker 2>me joy,</v>

11
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 2>but we'll also at the same time just</v>
<v Speaker 2>make my corner of the world slightly</v>

12
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
