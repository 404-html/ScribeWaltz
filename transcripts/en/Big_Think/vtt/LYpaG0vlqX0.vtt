<v Speaker 1>Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Originally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was brought up in the middle of</v>

3
00:00:09.361 --> 00:00:14.361
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska in a small rural town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1,733 miles to Boston and 1733 to sam</v>

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.800
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>very profoundly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents were Greek immigrants.</v>

6
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.800
<v Speaker 1>They came here without a pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a without a word of English and a third</v>

7
00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>grade education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they moved out to men,</v>

8
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska because that's where their</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatives,</v>

9
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:43.251
<v Speaker 1>where my father took a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one else would take washing dishes</v>

10
00:00:43.591 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>and the caboose of a Union Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 1>railroad that was being built.</v>

11
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>It was steaming hot there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess the reason no one wanted</v>

12
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:58.581
<v Speaker 1>to take the job and he ate on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>caboose and slept on the caboose and</v>

13
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:03.621
<v Speaker 1>saved a virtually everything he made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which he turned into the inevitable</v>

14
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Greek restaurant 24 hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven days a week for 25 years.</v>

15
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>That never closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was there all too many of those</v>

16
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks and uh,</v>

17
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>and years.</v>

18
00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say I'm a great as much as I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>like because he'd leave by six in the</v>

19
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>morning and he'd come home about nine</v>
<v Speaker 1>o'clock at night,</v>

20
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>pretty much exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my brother and myself could spend a</v>

21
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>few minutes with him then usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>providing some hot water and salt for</v>
<v Speaker 1>his legs that were swollen with varicose</v>

23
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>veins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was a great model of,</v>

24
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

25
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>achieving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and saving for the future.</v>

26
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>He believed deeply in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believed deeply in the American dream</v>

27
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>and we seem to have forgotten as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American dream is all about your,</v>

28
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>your children doing better than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons he saved was</v>

29
00:02:09.811 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he put it</v>

31
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>to bias,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best education money could buy.</v>

32
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 1>And indeed he did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I learned a great deal from him about</v>

33
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on your goals,</v>

34
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving</v>

35
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>and investing.</v>

36
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>My mother was also a Greek immigrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She spent most of her time cooking and</v>

37
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>making all the clothes we wore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which at times got pretty embarrassing.</v>

38
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>She did everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She washed iron scrubbed,</v>

39
00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.930
<v Speaker 1>mowed the lawn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

40
00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.720
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything she didn't do around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house,</v>

41
00:02:54.721 --> 00:02:59.721
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that during World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they build an air force base near</v>

42
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.911
<v Speaker 1>the small town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business exploded in size and she</v>

43
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>worked many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many hours there too.</v>

44
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>But for much of her life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the typical American homemaker</v>

45
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>I'd say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we saw infinitely more her than we</v>

46
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:19.661
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

47
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:20.494
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

48
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>The first born son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically,</v>

49
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>as we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has certain advantages and certain</v>

50
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was treated like a prince and I,</v>

52
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the great advantage during the first</v>

53
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 1>three years or so of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.080
<v Speaker 1>probably they're developing a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy sense of self esteem and</v>

55
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>affection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ran into a tragedy.</v>

56
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was four,</v>

57
00:03:55.691 --> 00:04:00.691
<v Speaker 1>my one year old sister died suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>from croup form of pneumonia,</v>

58
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was my mother's</v>

59
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.680
<v Speaker 1>attempt to be born again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say through her daughter</v>

60
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>because he's great wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live very tough lives giving how their</v>

61
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.800
<v Speaker 1>husbands were working and when she lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>her beloved daughter,</v>

62
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>she went into very deep mourning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

63
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:35.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a child who normally</v>

64
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>thinks we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we think of ourselves as the</v>

65
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>center of the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything revolves around us.</v>

66
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>We're responsible for everything.</v>

67
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.630
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wondered why as my mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrew and to the deepest,</v>

68
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:57.271
<v Speaker 1>deepest depression psychologically what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did to cause her to abandon me,</v>

69
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>added to my complexities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd say.</v>

70
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I formed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:12.890
<v Speaker 1>a pattern of having to achieve and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to be perfect so I could somehow</v>

72
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>regain her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.230
<v Speaker 1>her affection and her intention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's had some good points and just had</v>

74
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.771
<v Speaker 1>some bad points because trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve perfection can be a productive,</v>

75
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>that can also be a very destructive</v>
<v Speaker 1>process after a while.</v>

76
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>So she had quite an impact on me</v>
<v Speaker 1>while I was pretty dumb about</v>

77
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>recognizing whatever talents I do have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Ball,</v>

78
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:53.410
<v Speaker 1>the grade under secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of my partners at Lehman used to</v>

79
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:58.411
<v Speaker 1>refer to me as relentlessly analytical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty good at analyzing problems,</v>

80
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.480
<v Speaker 1>getting the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising the right questions and uh,</v>

81
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also a peculiar combination</v>

82
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.630
<v Speaker 1>of a total mechanical Klutz in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm incapable of operating in the</v>

83
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:23.651
<v Speaker 1>most simple machine or fixing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've always been rather creative on</v>

84
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>asking questions that is inventing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

85
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 1>So I went through some job changes early</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

86
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:40.271
<v Speaker 1>which reflected a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost invincible ignorance of my</v>

87
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.530
<v Speaker 1>qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did my graduate work at University of</v>

88
00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Chicago on Adam Smith taught us about</v>
<v Speaker 1>comparative advantage and how you ought</v>

89
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:55.721
<v Speaker 1>to focus on your comparative advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for reasons that aren't clear at all</v>

90
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into retailing</v>

91
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.840
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

92
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.340
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was assistant manager of a toy</v>

93
00:07:09.341 --> 00:07:11.890
<v Speaker 1>department at Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can believe that.</v>

94
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:13.743
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

95
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.370
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that experience played to my</v>

96
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:20.370
<v Speaker 1>comparative advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine what they were.</v>

97
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>So I quickly got out of that business</v>
<v Speaker 1>and got into the market research and</v>

98
00:07:26.161 --> 00:07:31.161
<v Speaker 1>analysis business was where I belonged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And later on into the advertising</v>

99
00:07:32.281 --> 00:07:37.230
<v Speaker 1>business where I could combine whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>analytical ability I had</v>

100
00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:42.600
<v Speaker 1>with working with a creative people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by asking them questions and suggesting</v>

101
00:07:42.601 --> 00:07:46.390
<v Speaker 1>problems that need to be solved without</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing how to sell them.</v>

102
00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>So I think my talents are somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the line of analyzing things and</v>

103
00:07:51.751 --> 00:07:56.751
<v Speaker 1>having a certain sense maybe of where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is going and being reasonably</v>

104
00:07:57.811 --> 00:08:02.811
<v Speaker 1>creative and asking the questions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes lead to creative answers.</v>

105
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge believer in dumb luck.</v>

106
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:13.930
<v Speaker 1>I think Donald Look beats a smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning much more often than we would</v>

107
00:08:14.961 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 1>like to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:18.200
<v Speaker 1>people have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:23.660
<v Speaker 1>incorrectly praised my quite varied</v>
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>

110
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>including government service and public</v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

111
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:35.020
<v Speaker 1>And I like to explain and how I got into</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to Washington and President</v>

112
00:08:35.931 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Nixon's White House and later to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet,</v>

113
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>I was working at 39 self of cell in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

114
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.343
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

115
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I used to walk to the railroad stations</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot cheaper.</v>

116
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I one day I noticed at 19 south of cell</v>

117
00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>there was universe Chicago graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

118
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I been planning to go to northwestern</v>

119
00:09:03.541 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>where I'd done my undergraduate work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was all the way across Chicago</v>

120
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>and since it was night school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have taken me 20,</v>

121
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes to get over there in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes to get back.</v>

122
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I had to go to the University of</v>

124
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be a pretty good place.</v>

125
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I went to the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago.</v>

126
00:09:23.651 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with career</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning or anything of the sort.</v>

127
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It was there that I made some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best friends I have on the faculty.</v>

128
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman,</v>

129
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 1>George Stiegler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Shultz,</v>

130
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.050
<v Speaker 1>and George later you'll recall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a very senior figure in the Nixon</v>

131
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became secretary of Labor,</v>

132
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>office of Management and Budget</v>

133
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.610
<v Speaker 1>Secretary to Treasury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then later in the Reagan</v>

134
00:09:56.611 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secretary of State and George and I had</v>

135
00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:03.240
<v Speaker 1>worked very close together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Chicago.</v>

136
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>And I had taught there for about four or</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years,</v>

137
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 1>part time at night.</v>

138
00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:15.130
<v Speaker 1>So one day he called me and said that</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Nixon wants to see it</v>

140
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:18.760
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I go to Washington.</v>

141
00:10:18.761 --> 00:10:23.761
<v Speaker 1>I ended up in the Oval Office and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president pointed out to me that,</v>

142
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thought economics was going to become</v>

143
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>terribly important at the vortex and</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy and that,</v>

144
00:10:36.521 --> 00:10:37.354
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.390
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

146
00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 1>he and Henry Kissinger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my good friend had a very complicated</v>

147
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For some reason he felt need to tell me</v>

148
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 1>that Henry didn't know a damn thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about economics and uh,</v>

149
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>what was worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know what he didn't know.</v>

150
00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>So he went on to set up a new council</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterpart of the National Security</v>

151
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Council and I was to head it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

152
00:11:04.171 --> 00:11:09.171
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a anything I had planned or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and I've looked back on that.</v>

153
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:14.211
<v Speaker 1>I've been immensely grateful for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>public service opportunity,</v>

154
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>some of the most exciting experiences</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadening I'd ever had.</v>

155
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It has led to my being involved with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some great nonprofit organizations.</v>

156
00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.010
<v Speaker 1>I just stepped down after 22 years as</v>
<v Speaker 1>chairman of the council on Foreign</v>

157
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.860
<v Speaker 1>Relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the founding chairman of the so</v>

158
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:37.980
<v Speaker 1>called Peterson Institute for</v>
<v Speaker 1>International Economics,</v>

159
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.100
<v Speaker 1>one of the founders of the concord</v>
<v Speaker 1>coalition.</v>

160
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.010
<v Speaker 1>And I doubt very much I would have done</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things if I hadn't gone to</v>

161
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

162
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And I thought I'd go into Washington if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't have,</v>

163
00:11:52.830 --> 00:11:57.830
<v Speaker 1>didn't happen to have an office at 39 as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as southwest cell in Chicago didn't</v>

164
00:11:58.541 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>happen to have a downtown school at 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest cell.</v>

165
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>So never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never</v>

166
00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.550
<v Speaker 1>underestimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of luck in life.</v>

167
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think the trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've forgotten who the councilman was</v>

168
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:19.240
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York who once said,</v>

169
00:12:19.241 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I seen my opportunities and I took them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

170
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:29.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important when you do have</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that luck thrust upon you to</v>

171
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:34.840
<v Speaker 1>somehow be made in such a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>

172
00:12:34.841 --> 00:12:39.841
<v Speaker 1>That is Paul Tillich said once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're comfortable with ambiguity,</v>

173
00:12:40.511 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you need when you're in a</v>

174
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:48.091
<v Speaker 1>rapidly changing world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I say dumb luck and taken advantage</v>

175
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:53.251
<v Speaker 1>of your opportunities will often lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>more instinct places then a longterm</v>

176
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 1>smart career planning.</v>

177
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do a lot of traveling around the world</v>

178
00:13:04.211 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and government,</v>

179
00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:11.161
<v Speaker 1>I got to know other governments as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a remarkable country with regard</v>

180
00:13:11.261 --> 00:13:15.470
<v Speaker 1>to its absence of barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

181
00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:18.070
<v Speaker 1>is resilience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's responsiveness.</v>

182
00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Just think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

183
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>when my father started his restaurant in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1920s,</v>

184
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant was petitioned by the Ku</v>
<v Speaker 1>Klux Klan saying,</v>

185
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>don't eat with the Greek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were no blacks there.</v>

186
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:42.760
<v Speaker 1>So I guess they figured the grapes where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next most desirable,</v>

187
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>target.</v>

188
00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:50.010
<v Speaker 1>We go from a situation like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where if anybody's been prejudiced</v>

189
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:55.540
<v Speaker 1>against me because I was a great guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been unaware of it.</v>

190
00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.813
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

191
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.550
<v Speaker 1>I worked in the 1960s with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.540
<v Speaker 1>when I was CEO of a company called Bell</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Howell with Martin Luther King.</v>

193
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:14.590
<v Speaker 1>And I went through the tragic</v>
<v Speaker 1>division and racism of the,</v>

194
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:22.420
<v Speaker 1>of the 60s where blacks were formerly</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most often informally blocked from</v>

195
00:14:24.831 --> 00:14:28.190
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of participation in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

196
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.420
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social,</v>

197
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:34.580
<v Speaker 1>political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked today to Barack Obama and,</v>

198
00:14:34.581 --> 00:14:35.414
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

200
00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's quite possible today,</v>

201
00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:45.190
<v Speaker 1>let a black could be elected president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

202
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's taken place in a remarkably</v>
<v Speaker 1>short period of time.</v>

203
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:56.050
<v Speaker 1>So this is a country with limitless</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontiers and very few barriers.</v>

204
00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you work hard and study hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got good luck,</v>

205
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 1>you can do very well in this country.</v>
