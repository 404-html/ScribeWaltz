00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.253
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a lousy,</v>

3
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:13.411
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm old enough to have lived through a</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>few business cycles so I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly perturbed about it by it.</v>

6
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.920
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I'm a change creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

8
00:00:25.921 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>So from an entrepreneur's perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a good time or bad time,</v>

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>it's just the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the time like any other time and</v>

10
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>any other time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>there's always opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the opportunity has to fit with the,</v>

12
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.031
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

13
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current economic context.</v>

14
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think the fact that the,</v>

15
00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economies,</v>

16
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>at a slow period and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and maybe so for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there shouldn't be anything.</v>

19
00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.003
<v Speaker 1>The turtle</v>

20
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.993
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

21
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think just so many stupid things that</v>

23
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>are currently going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a few things that would be</v>

24
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:12.041
<v Speaker 1>really helpful for small business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge and unmanageable costs for</v>

25
00:01:12.981 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>small businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare and the cost to the</v>

26
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>individual entrepreneur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you leave a corporate job and start</v>

27
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>your own business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just to do,</v>

28
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>to take care of yourself and your family</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a huge,</v>

29
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 1>huge expense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem.</v>

30
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:30.880
<v Speaker 1>That's not just for small businesses is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a national problem that we have a,</v>

31
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>that the issue of healthcare that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be addressed and there's got to</v>

32
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>be affordable healthcare for a to allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who work in small business to</v>

33
00:01:39.531 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>have the coverage that they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I would extend that to thinking</v>

34
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>about all sorts of other employee</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits and pensions and so on,</v>

35
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.070
<v Speaker 1>a great obstacle for small businesses to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to attract people out of</v>

36
00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>corporate jobs if they have to give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those,</v>

37
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>some of those perks of pensions and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

38
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>so healthcare is one big issue at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second big issue.</v>

40
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're now dealing with a gasoline that</v>

41
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.140
<v Speaker 1>at unheard of prices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.550
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>which is adding a real burden for lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of folks just getting back and forth to</v>

44
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's changing the nature of our</v>

45
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.580
<v Speaker 1>this is potentially a good thing if a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this can be signaled in some,</v>

47
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:30.581
<v Speaker 1>through some policy way to suggest that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to for once take seriously</v>

48
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>the idea of reducing our dependence on</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil and the venture community is just</v>

49
00:02:36.231 --> 00:02:41.231
<v Speaker 1>chomping at the bit a to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address some of these issues of</v>

50
00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>renewable energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:43.221 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that as oil prices have</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone up and down,</v>

52
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>a previous investments didn't pan out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the oil price goes up and the</v>

53
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>price comes down and all of a sudden the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost of these old alternative</v>

54
00:02:54.381 --> 00:02:55.820
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:55.821 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>is too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

56
00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

57
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>something that could really be a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>boost to the economy is,</v>

59
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>is a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious policy,</v>

60
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>a initiative to address the healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs and a serious policy issue,</v>

61
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

62
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow entrepreneurs to address the issue</v>

63
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:22.111
<v Speaker 1>of renewable energies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will just bring so much a new</v>

64
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>talent and ideas into the marketplace.</v>
