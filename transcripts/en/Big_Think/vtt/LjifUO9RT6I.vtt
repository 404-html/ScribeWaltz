1
00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Ms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the first or second day.</v>

2
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And my brother had been elected to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress and he asked me whether I</v>

3
00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>wanted a tour of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>of Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I welcomed the,</v>

5
00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity and he brought me around</v>

6
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:32.191
<v Speaker 1>to the House of Representatives and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought me to the United States Senate,</v>

7
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.280
<v Speaker 1>brought me over to the Supreme Court of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

8
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>pointed out the White House along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those magnificent monuments,</v>

9
00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>the Lincoln,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Washington monument.</v>

10
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>But he gave advice to me then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

11
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

12
00:00:46.721 --> 00:00:47.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuck with me.</v>

13
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 1>I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably 12 years old at the,</v>

14
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

15
00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and he said to look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll,</v>

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you'll visit the buildings now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see these buildings.</v>

17
00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>That'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said that the really importance</v>

18
00:00:59.561 --> 00:01:03.730
<v Speaker 1>of this visit is that you take an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in what is happens inside these</v>

19
00:01:03.731 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

21
00:01:06.461 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a nice sort of idea,</v>

22
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:09.831
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

24
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are we going to get hot dogs or</v>

25
00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:15.370
<v Speaker 1>something or other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or go to a baseball or a football game.</v>

26
00:01:15.371 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>But the resonance of that message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>stayed with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.111
<v Speaker 1>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>all of my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>it was good advice at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's advice I share with a,</v>

32
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>when young people come from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

33
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and visit the,</v>

34
00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:32.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capital,</v>

35
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the way,</v>

36
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way really our democracy is going</v>

37
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:41.021
<v Speaker 1>to work is if people take the interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the time involved themselves in</v>

38
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.261
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

39
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>the political life of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's enormously.</v>
