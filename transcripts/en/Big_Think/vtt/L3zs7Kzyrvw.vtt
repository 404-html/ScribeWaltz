1
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I've always known that I was attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to guys to people of the same sex since</v>

2
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 1>I was a little kid and I was raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any religion.</v>

3
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to get Jesus and Santa Confused</v>

4
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>when I was a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was raised without religion.</v>

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't go to junior high school for</v>

8
00:00:28.341 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>any length of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

9
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then at a very early age,</v>

10
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I was plunged into this extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>living situation when I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>when my mother gave me to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her psychiatrist and his family to live.</v>

13
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:47.531
<v Speaker 1>So my sexual orientation was nothing I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever questioned or struggled with or</v>

14
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:53.171
<v Speaker 1>thought about it just why I'm right</v>
<v Speaker 1>handed I'm right handed and it's just a</v>

15
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

16
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>So being gay was exactly the same thing.</v>

17
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.820
<v Speaker 1>It was just a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always been like that for me in</v>

18
00:00:58.821 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>my career all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

19
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

20
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I've never been something I struggled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

22
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:07.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

23
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I've been asked and I've actually been</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized by some people in who have</v>

24
00:01:10.761 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>misinterpreted when asked by the gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>press,</v>

25
00:01:13.731 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>are you proud to be gay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have often reply.</v>

26
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm not proud because I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished anything.</v>

27
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>If I were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had been the child of Evangelical</v>

28
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Christian parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be damn proud.</v>

29
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I had worked for my identity,</v>

30
00:01:28.071 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>I would be proud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

31
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never did.</v>

32
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesbian people who came before me</v>

35
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.290
<v Speaker 1>and made it possible for me to take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted,</v>

36
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I myself haven't really,</v>

37
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't struggled and overcome anything</v>

38
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not proud of being right handed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at the same time what I would I</v>

39
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 1>change and be straight if I could never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>

40
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>no interest would never do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never do it.</v>

41
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>So I'm really happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this way,</v>

42
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like I accomplished</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

43
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I took her driver's test and passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just born knowing how to drive.</v>
