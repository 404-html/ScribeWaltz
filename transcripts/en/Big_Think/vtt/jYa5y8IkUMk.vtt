1
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the basic outlook as it would be</v>

2
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>that people are monkeys with large</v>
<v Speaker 1>brains,</v>

3
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the way you have to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

5
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

6
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>it does make me cynical about human</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation and it,</v>

8
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it makes me think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to be very practical,</v>

9
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>very realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

10
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't put any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any faith in a utopian.</v>

12
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>A drain was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think people are basically good</v>

13
00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the promises of politicians and the,</v>

15
00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and the Bologna that judges spew out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their opinions.</v>

16
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 1>I think when one wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

17
00:01:06.821 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>have a caustic view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

19
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all people,</v>

20
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be</v>

21
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>no recognize if it's severe problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>with criminality.</v>

22
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>We also have problems with a no abuse of</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority and,</v>

23
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>and with a mistreatment of all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and</v>

24
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 1>overextension of criminal laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excessive criminal sentences.</v>

25
00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

26
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>the problems are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

27
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I very much dislike the extremes of left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and right.</v>

28
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and anything that is faith based,</v>

29
00:01:53.141 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>whether it's religious or whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

30
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:56.771 --> 00:02:00.460
<v Speaker 1>the left there just as religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a god,</v>

32
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>my sister's religious in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

33
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>that is based on faith rather than fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we should always be trying</v>

34
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:11.720
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.930
<v Speaker 1>penetrate to the level of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the criticism of this,</v>

36
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:20.810
<v Speaker 1>of the pragmatic position is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not enough to know what the facts are.</v>

37
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>I know what the consequences are because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be valued.</v>

38
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>there's a disjunction between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't you can infer a lot from as I</v>

40
00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.260
<v Speaker 1>agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

41
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>but there is a degree of consensus and</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

42
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>So they didn't actually know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of,</v>

43
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of particular</v>

44
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that most people will be brought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's a basic moral</v>

46
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like moralistic vocabulary,</v>

47
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>moralistic reasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But obviously there is more,</v>

48
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>there are people have moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings,</v>

49
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:08.480
<v Speaker 1>they do react to things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

50
00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>if everything was known about abortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who gets it,</v>

51
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>why there are other ways of preventing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

52
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing,</v>

53
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>he really understood it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we would</v>

54
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>get most people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not 100 percent,</v>

55
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>but maybe 60 percent would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

56
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:29.880
<v Speaker 1>this is what and how is she.</v>
