1
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.003
<v Speaker 1>I sort of interesting fact is that while</v>
<v Speaker 1>today programming is viewed as the </v>

2
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:10.763
<v Speaker 1>extremely male dominated field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was totally the opposite at the dawn </v>

3
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>of computing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All programmers of uh,</v>

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the very beginning where women had,</v>

5
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>and it was because this job was seen as </v>
<v Speaker 1>being beneath men.</v>

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so somehow in the interceding 30,</v>

8
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:27.654
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years that's come Jack Gender </v>

9
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.123
<v Speaker 1>Dynamics has completely shifted around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we're seeing now is that </v>

10
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's the implicit biases that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

11
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.003
<v Speaker 1>which are holding back women and </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities from entering the workforce </v>

12
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.970
<v Speaker 1>either as data scientists or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:49.140
<v Speaker 1>or as computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>engineers and software engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen a lot of research in this</v>

16
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>area that's shown that there can be some</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicit biases that,</v>

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we judge people once we know </v>

18
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>their ne,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.253
<v Speaker 1>from their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sort of their gender or their </v>

21
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.523
<v Speaker 1>race.</v>

22
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.633
<v Speaker 1>And what we do right when we assess the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were going to be working for </v>

23
00:01:13.471 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>us is we are completely blind to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

24
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>We actually strip away the name when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider people,</v>

25
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>

26
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:22.404
<v Speaker 1>We just look at how they perform on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>series of challenges that we give them </v>

27
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>that really try to test their ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

28
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a data scientist and test their </v>

29
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>understanding of these kind of core </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental mathematical and programming</v>

30
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

31
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we do that,</v>

32
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it actually becomes a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fair process,</v>

33
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.593
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it actually can help increase the </v>

34
00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>number of women and underrepresented </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities,</v>

35
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

36
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.853
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who sort of make it through the </v>

37
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:51.324
<v Speaker 1>screening process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just to give you one sort of quick </v>

38
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>anecdote about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.763
<v Speaker 1>there's a famous story about music </v>
<v Speaker 1>auditions in the 1970s where orchestras </v>

40
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>had a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tiny percentage of their members or</v>

41
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:06.714
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their players.</v>

43
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>They're the people who are playing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the orchestra,</v>

44
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as women.</v>

45
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.570
<v Speaker 1>And what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.633
<v Speaker 1>is at some point they decided to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>break free from this and they will put </v>

47
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>down a curtain between the performer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the artist,</v>

48
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.363
<v Speaker 1>the auditioner and the judge judging </v>
<v Speaker 1>panel that was trying to determine </v>

49
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>whether these people should be allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play in the orchestra.</v>

50
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>And when they did the results were night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and day.</v>

51
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a famous study of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>that's up on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the National Bureau of Economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Research's websites,</v>

54
00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>published by two famous researchers from</v>

55
00:02:39.541 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Harvard talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called a orchestra in diversity.</v>

56
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.840
<v Speaker 1>And it talks about how the results were </v>
<v Speaker 1>night and day difference,</v>

57
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women,</v>

58
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.053
<v Speaker 1>the fraction of women who made it past </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screening round shot up something </v>

59
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>like seven fold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

61
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not having the curtain down and having a</v>

62
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.354
<v Speaker 1>curtain down and it just goes to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that's at this time there was an </v>

63
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:05.611
<v Speaker 1>implicit bias that women weren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of caliber of musician that you</v>

64
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.640
<v Speaker 1>needed to be able to perform at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Carnegie Hall.</v>

65
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

66
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at these kinds of top,</v>

67
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of top level,</v>

68
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:16.624
<v Speaker 1>some phonic performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you put down a curtain and you </v>

69
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:19.714
<v Speaker 1>just listened to them as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to see whether they were a </v>

70
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:25.170
<v Speaker 1>man or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.043
<v Speaker 1>you then without that kind of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you suddenly were forced to make </v>

72
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>judgments just based in the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just based on their ability.</v>

73
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>And you saw that they w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you are much more willing to let in</v>

75
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 1>women than before.</v>
