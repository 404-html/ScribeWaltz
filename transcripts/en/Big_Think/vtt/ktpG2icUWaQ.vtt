00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>If what you're saying now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with Hulu,</v>

2
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>network sites like nbc.com and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the availability of,</v>

8
00:00:24.471 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of online video,</v>

9
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>more and more ubiquitous broadband</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>

12
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>video becomes something that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy to get online and,</v>

15
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.150
<v Speaker 1>and very compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you can watch anything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want whenever you want it is,</v>

17
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.231
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>that has a lot of appeal for obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

19
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

20
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>television obviously isn't set up that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

21
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>and frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cable companies,</v>

23
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>which have enormous amounts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth,</v>

25
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.371
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>coming into the home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>most of that bandwidth is now taken up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with analog programming,</v>

29
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

30
00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have nearly the efficiency of</v>

31
00:01:12.081 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>digital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with it,</v>

32
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change over to,</v>

33
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>to digital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

35
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be going away soon.</v>

36
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

37
00:01:20.931 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

39
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>what's happening I think is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are beginning to,</v>

40
00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>to confront the fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>when you watch tv it becomes really hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find what you want.</v>

42
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be sure on demand</v>

44
00:01:37.971 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>programming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

45
00:01:39.261 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>even to find the right on demand channel</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not exactly easy.</v>

46
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a very limited availability for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for what you want.</v>

49
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

50
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.320
<v Speaker 1>by contrast you can go online and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>easily search for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's there,</v>

53
00:01:58.071 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can watch it.</v>

55
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not there on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>a legit site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find it on a pirate site,</v>

57
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.800
<v Speaker 1>in more and more often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's now,</v>

59
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still a relatively small number of</v>

60
00:02:12.681 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the sort of tech savvy and the</v>

62
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>desire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

63
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.673
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>go that route,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to be the case for</v>

65
00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:23.684
<v Speaker 1>very long.</v>

66
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

67
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.253
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

68
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 1>so we're really only one step away from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching shows on the Internet,</v>

70
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on your computer to watching them on TV</v>

71
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 1>and companies like box the are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

72
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to make that possible,</v>

73
00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.061
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>starting to make that a plausible</v>
<v Speaker 1>option.</v>

75
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when that happens,</v>

76
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>idea of television as we know it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

79
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to change.</v>

80
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>kind of enormous sums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:07.940
<v Speaker 1>on a monthly basis for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>packages of programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of us,</v>

87
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>they don't really even want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

90
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>get anything you do want on a completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>on demand basis and watch it on your,</v>

95
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>on your tv set and it's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

96
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>very compelling proposition.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:03:38.411 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>the problem for the networks and for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable companies is that that's not the</v>

100
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 1>way the business is structured so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

101
00:03:45.071 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>the business is structured,</v>

102
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around cable companies,</v>

103
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.890
<v Speaker 1>pain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television networks,</v>

105

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

108
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>large sums per user,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the right to carry their</v>

110
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>programming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

111
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:03.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

112
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.440
<v Speaker 1>making money by charging the users for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

113
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the right to see that programming.</v>

114
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>when you have free online video that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can watch on your tv set that,</v>

116
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of does an end run around that</v>

117
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>whole set up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And which is to say,</v>

118
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really calls into question the entire</v>

119
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:27.320
<v Speaker 1>economic basis of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of television that we have right.</v>
