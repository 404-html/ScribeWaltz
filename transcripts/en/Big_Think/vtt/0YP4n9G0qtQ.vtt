1
00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.373
<v Speaker 1>MMM,</v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.550
<v Speaker 1>we all want to have a good stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with somebody at one of the</v>

3
00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:10.384
<v Speaker 1>problems with early stage intense </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of romantic love is that it's </v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>part of the oldest parts of the brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>that become activated brain regions link</v>

5
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>with drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with craving,</v>

6
00:00:19.751 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>with obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with motivation,</v>

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.803
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cognitive regions up in the </v>

8
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:26.314
<v Speaker 1>prefrontal cortex that have evolved much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more reasonably begin to shut down a </v>

9
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>brain region linked with this decision </v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning ahead,</v>

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were madly in love,</v>

13
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:38.683
<v Speaker 1>can fall madly in love with somebody </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's married who lives on the other </v>

14
00:00:41.201 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>side of the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who comes from a different religion.</v>

15
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And somehow they'll say to themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll work it out.</v>

16
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>We can work this out because of all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy of intense romantic love and also</v>

17
00:00:50.921 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 1>the shutting down of various brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems like with decision making.</v>

18
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that I say to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people is,</v>

19
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>before you decide to marry somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend some,</v>

22
00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>a good deal of time with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.963
<v Speaker 1>so there's some of that early stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>intense feelings of romantic love can </v>

24
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:09.904
<v Speaker 1>begin to subside and you can begin to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really see what you've got is a matter </v>

25
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:15.334
<v Speaker 1>of fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very optimistic about the future of </v>

26
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:18.004
<v Speaker 1>relationships because we're spending so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much time now getting to know somebody </v>

27
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>before we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.483
<v Speaker 1>a great many people are having these one</v>
<v Speaker 1>night stands and friends with benefits </v>

29
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>and a living together before they </v>
<v Speaker 1>married.</v>

30
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.103
<v Speaker 1>And there was a recent study which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>asked a lot of single people who were </v>

31
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>living together with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why have they not yet married?</v>

33
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>And 67 percent were terrified of </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorce,</v>

34
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.850
<v Speaker 1>terrified of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only the legal and the financial and</v>

35
00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:49.684
<v Speaker 1>the economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the personal and social fallout of </v>

36
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:52.594
<v Speaker 1>divorce.</v>

37
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:53.523
<v Speaker 1>And so began to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began to realize maybe all this </v>

38
00:01:56.861 --> 00:02:01.300
<v Speaker 1>hooking up and friends with benefits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>living together is not recklessness.</v>

39
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.313
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's caution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe singles are trying to learn every </v>

40
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:11.011
<v Speaker 1>single thing they can about a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner before they tie the knot.</v>

41
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:12.693
<v Speaker 1>And in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage used to be the beginning of a </v>

42
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:15.814
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the finale and I think that </v>

43
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 1>that is very positive as a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

44
00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:22.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with match.com</v>

45
00:02:22.181 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>and their senior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

46
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>other chief scientific advisor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

47
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>we did a study of married people not on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the site match.com,</v>

48
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of 1100 married people.</v>

49
00:02:32.291 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>And I had reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:38.551
<v Speaker 1>if there's this long precommitment stage</v>
<v Speaker 1>of getting to know somebody,</v>

51
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe by the time you walk down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>aisle,</v>

52
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.213
<v Speaker 1>you know what you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're happy with what you got and </v>

53
00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:45.490
<v Speaker 1>you're going to build a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>

54
00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>really happy marriage.</v>

55
00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.123
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we're going towards a time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>happier marriages because relationships </v>

56
00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 1>can end before you tie the knot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with,</v>

57
00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>in this study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked these 1100 married people,</v>

58
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>a lot of questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the questions was,</v>

60
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>would you remarry the person you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently married to?</v>

61
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
<v Speaker 1>An 81 percent said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that with what I call fast </v>

62
00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow love,</v>

63
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>with this slow process of getting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know somebody very carefully over a long</v>

64
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.194
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help the brain readjust </v>

65
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>some of these brain regions for decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

66
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get to know how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>person handles your parents at Christmas</v>

67
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 1>or whatever holiday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>how they handle your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they handle their money,</v>

69
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>how they handle an argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>how they handle getting exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own health and your health,</v>

71
00:03:40.181 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You learn a lot about the person.</v>

72
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in a fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very optimistic about the future </v>

73
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>because of this concept of slow love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really in the advice business,</v>

74
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.623
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the business I think people should </v>

75
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>marry when they feel like marrying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from what I know about the brain,</v>

76
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it were me,</v>

77
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.503
<v Speaker 1>I'd wait at least two years because in </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years you see the full cycle of the </v>

78
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>year twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see how they handle halloween,</v>

79
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
<v Speaker 1>how they handled Christmas or Hanukkah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they handle a summer fun.</v>

80
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to see,</v>

81
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>see that twice is I think important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

82
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>you can sustain that intense feelings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic love.</v>

83
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:29.290
<v Speaker 1>For two years I've studied 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people through match.com,</v>

84
00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>not on the match.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>site,</v>

85
00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.193
<v Speaker 1>a representative sample of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the US census and a great many </v>

86
00:04:36.761 --> 00:04:37.594
<v Speaker 1>of them say that they've had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of sustained feelings of </v>

87
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>intense romantic love for somebody for </v>
<v Speaker 1>two to five years.</v>

88
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you pick the right person and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know how to sustain some of the joy,</v>

89
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can create a longterm,</v>

90
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment that is full also have </v>

91
00:04:55.361 --> 00:04:56.194
<v Speaker 1>periods of romantic love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all want to sustain a longterm happy </v>

92
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 1>partnership and psychologists will give </v>
<v Speaker 1>you a long list of smart ways to sustain</v>

93
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:07.264
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'd like to say what the brain can </v>

94
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:10.414
<v Speaker 1>add.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I studied the brain and the first thing </v>

95
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:15.034
<v Speaker 1>that you want to do is sustain the three</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic brain systems for mating and </v>

96
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex drive.</v>

97
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 1>Have sex with the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sex regularly with the partner.</v>

98
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:25.744
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have time scheduled a time </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have sex with the partner because </v>

99
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 1>when you have sex with a partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

100
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.234
<v Speaker 1>you're driving up the testosterone </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems so you're going to want to have </v>

101
00:05:32.921 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>more sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have all the cuddling which</v>

102
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:36.424
<v Speaker 1>is going to drive up the oxytocin system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give you feelings of attachment and </v>

103
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.510
<v Speaker 1>having sex with the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.353
<v Speaker 1>any kind of stimulation of the genitals </v>
<v Speaker 1>drives up the dopamine system and can </v>

105
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.710
<v Speaker 1>sustain feelings of romantic love.</v>

106
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>So basically having set and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

107
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 1>there can be good jokes about it and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxation about it that is good for the</v>

108
00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.064
<v Speaker 1>body and the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So have sex with a person and sustain </v>

109
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.104
<v Speaker 1>that brain system of this x drive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain feelings of intense romantic </v>

110
00:06:03.351 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do novel things together.</v>

111
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.343
<v Speaker 1>Novelty drives up the dope immune system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can sustain feelings of romantic </v>

112
00:06:09.591 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't just in the bedroom.</v>

113
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Just go to a different restaurant on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday night.</v>

114
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Take your bicycle instead of a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a read to each other in bed.</v>

115
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Sit together on the couch and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

116
00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>and have a discussion about something </v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

117
00:06:21.981 --> 00:06:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Read new books together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty,</v>

118
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>novelty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelty,</v>

119
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.440
<v Speaker 1>sustained feelings of intense romantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>love.</v>

120
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 1>You also want to sustain feelings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deep attachment.</v>

121
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>And to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to just stay in touch.</v>

122
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to sleep in the person's arm.</v>

123
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>At least start that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 1>cuddle a after dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a walk arm in,</v>

125
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>arm down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold hands together,</v>

126
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 1>put your foot on top of his foot or her </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot while you're having dinner,</v>

127
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.193
<v Speaker 1>gently of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stay in touch that drives up the </v>

128
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.114
<v Speaker 1>oxytocin system and can give you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings of deep attachment to the </v>

129
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:57.584
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to sustain all three of </v>

130
00:06:58.941 --> 00:07:00.290
<v Speaker 1>those brain systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex drive,</v>

131
00:07:00.291 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>feelings of romantic love and feelings </v>
<v Speaker 1>of deep attachment.</v>

132
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 1>But we've also found out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

133
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in the brain in longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy partners.</v>

134
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.083
<v Speaker 1>We did a study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brain scan study of people who were </v>

135
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an average of 21 years.</v>

136
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And those people who were married an </v>
<v Speaker 1>average of 21 years who were still madly</v>

137
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>in love with their partner showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity in three brain regions of brain</v>

138
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:27.134
<v Speaker 1>region linked with empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a brain region linked with controlling </v>

139
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.034
<v Speaker 1>your own emotions and a brain region </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked with what we call positive </v>

140
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.073
<v Speaker 1>illusions.</v>

141
00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.200
<v Speaker 1>The simple ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it's hard to overlook what</v>

142
00:07:41.241 --> 00:07:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't like about somebody and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on what you do.</v>

143
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So last but not least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

144
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 1>we've known known that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

145
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:53.250
<v Speaker 1>if you say several nice things to your </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner every day,</v>

146
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would suggest five.</v>

147
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:56.690
<v Speaker 1>But if you can only pull off two or </v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

148
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.553
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Nice things to your partner that </v>

149
00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:05.021
<v Speaker 1>actually reduces their cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduces their cortisol,</v>

150
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:08.480
<v Speaker 1>which is the stress hormone and boosts </v>
<v Speaker 1>their immune system.</v>

151
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:09.463
<v Speaker 1>But it also boosts yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the brain says about a happy </v>

152
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 1>longterm partnership is overlook what </v>
<v Speaker 1>your Dole.</v>

153
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I can focus on what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

154
00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>express empathy for the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>control your own emotions,</v>

155
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 1>have sex with the partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do novel things together,</v>

156
00:08:25.811 --> 00:08:30.240
<v Speaker 1>and stay in touch and say several nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>things every day.</v>

157
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.273
<v Speaker 1>And you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brain will help you sustain a </v>

158
00:08:34.791 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deep attachment.</v>

159
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.360
<v Speaker 1>We're built to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're built to love.</v>
