1
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest factor that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect this is a tension,</v>

2
00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>if you do not pay attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

4
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it's very unlikely that you will learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have.</v>

6
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

7
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.900
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>just so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to make an example,</v>

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.590
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet the many people may not have as</v>

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>many of us remember what we did on</v>
<v Speaker 1>September 11th because you know,</v>

12
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>there was a coincidence just if we paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular attention to or,</v>

13
00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>or what happened that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet that much less people will</v>

14
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>remember what happened the day before or</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days before.</v>

15
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>So that's attention is also is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>

16
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Another factor that it is very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be motivation to,</v>

17
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>if you don't care about doing something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will not learn about.</v>

18
00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:19.290
<v Speaker 1>If you are depressed or things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

19
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>You will not learn what he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>what you just saw.</v>

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 1>What you just did will not memorize what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just did.</v>

22
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to be able to perceive the</v>

23
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you cannot see no way that he will</v>

24
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>remember us</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she's not here.</v>

25
00:01:40.531 --> 00:01:45.531
<v Speaker 1>You cannot remember words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we need to be able to get through to</v>

26
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the staff that we help</v>

28
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>remembering of usually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are not the only things because we</v>

29
00:01:58.951 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>can monitor also to chemicals and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>two other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also memories and hopefully in the</v>

31
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>future will be even better at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can also stimulate memory</v>

32
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.623
<v Speaker 1>chemical.</v>

33
00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they do,</v>

34
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will work at the level of the</v>

35
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>synaptic connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since at the time or memory,</v>

36
00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>there is a chain of chemical reaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the level of signups and I came here</v>

37
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>actually means the same as soon as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>protein enzyme molecules are activated.</v>

38
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 1>What do we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We kind of forced the system artificial</v>

39
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>through this chemical and so the</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge this chemicals to announce a,</v>

40
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 1>to announce a memory and they will do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very well in animals and hopefully</v>

41
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to do it in people as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

42
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>How many chemicals that one can use to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance memory.</v>

43
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.860
<v Speaker 1>And there are many proteins that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>relevant to the process of learning and</v>

44
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

45
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>all chemicals that act on a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>gene,</v>

47
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.600
<v Speaker 1>particular gene by the name of crab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that stimulate his gene and they came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out in several different ways are all</v>

49
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 1>molecule that in animals work quite well</v>
<v Speaker 1>at enhancing memory</v>

50
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>they had available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we can give an extra,</v>

51
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>an additional amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do in with these chemicals,</v>

52
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:47.281
<v Speaker 1>we take advantage of knowledge or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>normally happens in nature and a little</v>

53
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:52.471
<v Speaker 1>bit push in this is ending diseases even</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier because sometime if in disease we</v>

54
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>find out that one of this chemical is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>

55
00:03:57.941 --> 00:04:00.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in lower amount than what you would be</v>

56
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>normally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just help the process by giving it</v>

57
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.170
<v Speaker 1>efficiently.</v>
