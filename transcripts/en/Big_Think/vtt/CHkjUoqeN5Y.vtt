1
00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>I finished a book in the early part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>2007 for publication in October,</v>

2
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>2007 on current and national affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 1>because I think that the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>overarching thing going on is that the</v>

4
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>United States has to again become the</v>
<v Speaker 1>land of opportunity and the land and the</v>

5
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.190
<v Speaker 1>place that operates according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>

6
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's called America the principled</v>
<v Speaker 1>six opportunities for becoming a can do</v>

7
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>nation once again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those six opportunities seem to</v>

8
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>me to be the most important issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is how do we secure our future?</v>

9
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 1>And security isn't simply a matter of</v>
<v Speaker 1>watchdogs at airports.</v>

10
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:54.800
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of economic security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we keep jobs in the United</v>

11
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>States for Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we ensure that we have the</v>

12
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>technology to make us safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that requires investments in</v>

13
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>innovation and it requires open minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the life sciences are so important.</v>

14
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
<v Speaker 1>they have been so discredited by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration that has not cared about</v>

16
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>

17
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing enough to educate people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US in science and math,</v>

18
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>which are so important to our future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the engineering and science</v>

19
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>degrees being given in the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

20
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>advanced degrees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>phds are going to foreign nationals or</v>

21
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>people of foreign origins and as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm concerned,</v>

22
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>they're welcome here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would also like to see our young</v>

23
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 1>people get those degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

24
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the first challenge.</v>

25
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm very concerned about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappearing middle class and the</v>

26
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>problems of balancing work and family</v>
<v Speaker 1>that women have.</v>

27
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>So pursuing happiness was something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's written into our earliest</v>

28
00:01:57.891 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 1>origins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

29
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:02.930
<v Speaker 1>liberty and the pursuit of happiness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful lot of people aren't happy because</v>

30
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>they don't have healthcare because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to take two jobs.</v>

31
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're worried about their children.</v>

32
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's an important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clearly the war in Iraq as an important</v>

33
00:02:13.041 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>issue currently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's part of a larger problem of how</v>

34
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>do we engage with the world.</v>

35
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Is our form of engagement only saber</v>
<v Speaker 1>rattling or are we making those</v>

36
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>grassroots investments in the economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of other countries and the</v>

37
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 1>development of their leaders so that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have more allies and friends around the</v>

38
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a major challenge.</v>

39
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.350
<v Speaker 1>We are not liked in many parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

40
00:02:39.351 --> 00:02:44.351
<v Speaker 1>Well actually there's a gap between</v>
<v Speaker 1>liking Americans as a people and liking</v>

41
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:49.580
<v Speaker 1>the American government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many more people like Americans than</v>

42
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>like the American government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an speaking of government.</v>

43
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.900
<v Speaker 1>We have a problem with respect for</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

44
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years people have discredited</v>

45
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>government because so many government</v>
<v Speaker 1>officials have done things that are</v>

46
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>ethically challenged to put it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive way,</v>

47
00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of Washington was under</v>
<v Speaker 1>indictment for awhile.</v>

48
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>So if we don't restore respect for</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

49
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm sick of politicians running against</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

50
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm running for this office because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that we shouldn't have these</v>

51
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.564
<v Speaker 1>offices.</v>

52
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we need respect.</v>

53
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 1>So the good people run for office in</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn,</v>

54
00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:33.991
<v Speaker 1>they appoint competent people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about how well government is run.</v>

55
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>It's an.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a traditional American principle to</v>

56
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>say that government is best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which governs least,</v>

57
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>but frankly it can't govern least unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>it governs better because it's much more</v>

58
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>costly to have a disaster like Hurricane</v>
<v Speaker 1>Katrina than it would have been to</v>

59
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>invest in the levees in New Orleans in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place.</v>

60
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we need a spirit of service.</v>

61
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>The partisan divides in the partisan</v>
<v Speaker 1>ugliness and America has plagued us if</v>

62
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:09.451
<v Speaker 1>we spend so much time arguing with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other while fighting wars that we can't</v>

63
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:12.820
<v Speaker 1>possibly win and probably shouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in in the first place,</v>

64
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>then we will never heal this nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need things that bring us together</v>

65
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.220
<v Speaker 1>across partisan divides as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>divides of race or age or or urban</v>

66
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>versus rural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think community service and the</v>

67
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 1>generosity of American philanthropy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that can unite us.</v>

68
00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the themes that I've been</v>

69
00:04:34.931 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>writing about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things that I want on the</v>

70
00:04:37.931 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>agenda for the presidential election in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008.</v>

71
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things in the news that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bother me the most,</v>

72
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>but also inspire me to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions.</v>
