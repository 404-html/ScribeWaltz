1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 2>all systems of oppression are highly</v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptive and they can adapt to</v>

3
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 2>challenges and incorporate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can allow for exceptions,</v>

4
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 2>and I think the most effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>adaptation of the system of racism to</v>

5
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:22.450
<v Speaker 2>the challenges of the civil rights</v>
<v Speaker 2>movement was to reduce a racist to a</v>

6
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:26.020
<v Speaker 2>very simple formula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A racist is an individual,</v>

7
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.670
<v Speaker 2>always an individual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a system who consciously does not</v>

8
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:35.470
<v Speaker 2>like people based on race must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious and who intentionally seeks to</v>

9
00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 2>be mean to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Individual conscious intent.</v>

10
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 2>And if that is my definition of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>racist,</v>

11
00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>then your suggestion that anything I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>said or done is racist or has a racist</v>

12
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:51.280
<v Speaker 2>impact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to hear that as you just said,</v>

13
00:00:51.281 --> 00:00:54.820
<v Speaker 2>I was a bad person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just put me over there in that</v>

14
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of my bias anyway is</v>

15
00:00:58.361 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 2>unconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

16
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm not intending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware.</v>

17
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now I'm going to need to defend my</v>

18
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 2>moral character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

19
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 2>and I will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've all seen it.</v>

20
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be virtually impossible</v>
<v Speaker 2>based on that definition for the average</v>

21
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 2>white person to look deeply at their</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialization,</v>

22
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 2>to look at the inevitability of</v>
<v Speaker 2>internalizing racist biases,</v>

23
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 2>developing racist patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and having investments in the system of</v>

24
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 2>racism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty comfortable for us and</v>

25
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:36.400
<v Speaker 2>serves us really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that definition of a racist that</v>

26
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 2>either or what I call the good bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>binary is the root of virtually all</v>

27
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 2>white defensiveness on this topic</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes it virtually impossible</v>

28
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:49.651
<v Speaker 2>to talk to the average white person</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the inevitable absorption of a</v>

29
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:55.471
<v Speaker 2>racist worldview that we get by being</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally swimming in racist water.</v>

30
00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 2>So let me connect that to myself as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>result of being raised as a white person</v>

31
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 2>in this society.</v>

32
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 2>I have a racist worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a deep racist biases.</v>

33
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I have developed a racist patterns and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have investments in the system of racism</v>

34
00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:13.810
<v Speaker 2>because it's served me really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's comfortable.</v>

35
00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 2>It's helped me overcome the barriers</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I do face and I also have an</v>

36
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 2>investment and not seeing any of that</v>
<v Speaker 2>for what it would suggest to me about my</v>

37
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 2>identity and what it would require of</v>
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>

38
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't choose any of that.</v>

39
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel guilty about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't inevitable result of being</v>

40
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 2>raised in this society in which racism</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the bedrock.</v>

41
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 2>The question of guilt comes in in what</v>
<v Speaker 2>am I doing about that?</v>

42
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 2>While we who are white tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>fragile in that it doesn't take much to</v>

43
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:51.781
<v Speaker 2>upset us around race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The impact of our response is not</v>

44
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 2>fragile at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kind of weaponized defensiveness,</v>

45
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 2>weaponized hurt feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

46
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>and it functions really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really effectively to repel the</v>

47
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>

48
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 2>There was a white person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I moved through the world,</v>

49
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>racially comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually 24 slash seven.</v>

50
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.550
<v Speaker 2>It is exceptional for me to be outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>of my racial comfort zone and most of my</v>

51
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.811
<v Speaker 2>life I've been warned not to go outside</v>
<v Speaker 2>my racial comfort zone and so on the</v>

52
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:26.350
<v Speaker 2>rare occasion when I am uncomfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>racially,</v>

53
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a kind of throwing off of my racial</v>

54
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.160
<v Speaker 2>equilibrium and I need to get back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and so I will do whatever it takes</v>

55
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.620
<v Speaker 2>to repel the challenge and get back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>it and in that way I think white</v>

56
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>fragility functions as a kind of white</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial bullying.</v>

57
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 2>To be frank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we make it so miserable for people of</v>

58
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:55.141
<v Speaker 2>color to talk to us about are inevitable</v>
<v Speaker 2>and often unaware of racist patterns</v>

59
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.870
<v Speaker 2>that we cannot help develop from being</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialized into a culture in which</v>

60
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 2>racism is the bedrock and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundation.</v>

61
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 2>We make it so miserable for them to talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>to us about it that most of the time</v>

62
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:12.760
<v Speaker 2>they don't just and we just have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that most people of color</v>

63
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.820
<v Speaker 2>that are working or living in primarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>white environments take home way more</v>

64
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:23.791
<v Speaker 2>daily slights and hurts and insults than</v>
<v Speaker 2>they bother talking to us about</v>

65
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>because their experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to risk more punishment.</v>

66
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 2>They're going to lose the relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to have their experience</v>

67
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 2>minimized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explained away.</v>

68
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 2>They're going to cause the person to</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel attacked or hurt.</v>

69
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>And in that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>white fragility functions as a kind of</v>

70
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 2>everyday white racial control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that has to be intentional or</v>

71
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is how it functions and it's</v>

72
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:57.751
<v Speaker 2>actually incredibly liberating and</v>
<v Speaker 2>transformative to start from the premise</v>

73
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.030
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course I've internalized all of this</v>

74
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 2>and then I can stop defending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deflecting,</v>

75
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 2>denying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping you won't notice,</v>

76
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>minimizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining,</v>

77
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 2>and I can just let go of that and get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

78
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 2>And there's a question that's never</v>
<v Speaker 2>failed me in my efforts to unpack.</v>

79
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>How do we pull this off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do so many of us who are white</v>

80
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 2>individually feel so free of racism and</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet we live in a society that is so</v>

81
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>profoundly separate and unequal by race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question that's never failed me</v>

82
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 2>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this true or is this false?</v>

83
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Is this writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this wrong?</v>

84
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 2>But how does it function?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do these narratives that I tell,</v>

85
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 2>how do they function when I tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

86
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm just an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we all just be individuals?</v>

87
00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>When I tell you I was taught to treat</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone the same.</v>

88
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 2>When I tell you what it's focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>race that divides us.</v>

89
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 2>When I tell you I have lots of friends</v>
<v Speaker 2>of color,</v>

90
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.050
<v Speaker 2>those narratives have not changed our</v>
<v Speaker 2>outcome and they functioned to take race</v>

91
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.580
<v Speaker 2>off the table and to exempt the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>from any further engagement,</v>

92
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>and in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they functioned to protect the current</v>

93
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 2>racial hierarchy in the white position</v>
<v Speaker 2>within it.</v>

94
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be what I'm intending</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

95
00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 2>but it is the impact of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>narratives.</v>
