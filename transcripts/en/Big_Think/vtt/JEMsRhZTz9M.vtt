00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.010
<v Speaker 1>What question is how our happiness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits related.</v>

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And I've been researching and writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking and talking to people about</v>

3
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>happiness for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I started to notice was that</v>

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>habits play a really important role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness because a lot of times when I</v>

5
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 1>would talk to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some big happiness challenge</v>

6
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>in their life that I realized was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually related to some core habit.</v>

7
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't that they didn't think or</v>
<v Speaker 1>know that if they got more sleep,</v>

8
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.460
<v Speaker 1>they feel better or that if they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>spend so much time on the Internet</v>

9
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>during work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd be more productive or whatever.</v>

10
00:00:32.621 --> 00:00:34.900
<v Speaker 1>They had identified the change that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make,</v>

11
00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason they weren't able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to that change.</v>

12
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>They weren't able to make that change</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen no matter how much they wanted</v>

13
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could see that there was a</v>

14
00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>happiness gain out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't able to translate into</v>

15
00:00:46.361 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

16
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And that got me very focused on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue of habit change.</v>

17
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>So how is it that we specifically change</v>
<v Speaker 1>a habit so that we can make these</v>

18
00:00:56.411 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these aims that are so pressing in our</v>

19
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>lives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can we translate it into real</v>

20
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real change in our everyday lives?</v>

21
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Because the fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most of us,</v>

23
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of low hanging fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things just part of our</v>

24
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>ordinary day thinks that don't take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of time,</v>

25
00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:12.934
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or money,</v>

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>that if we could do them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would make us happier.</v>

27
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>But we really have to get ourselves to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually follow through.</v>

28
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>And so that's where habits come into</v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

29
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Because habits are the thing that allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to make those changes and just put</v>

30
00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 1>them on automatic pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just part of your everyday life</v>

31
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>and they make you happy.</v>
