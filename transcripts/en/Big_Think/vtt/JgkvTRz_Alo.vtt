1
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing we don't talk about is that</v>

2
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of hard to talk about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our,</v>

3
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>our minds have these kinds of back</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors.</v>

4
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of,</v>

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>if you're human and you wake up and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>open your eyes,</v>

6
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>there is a certain set of dimensions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>your experience that can be manipulated.</v>

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a magician.</v>

8
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>And you learn all about these limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that short term memory is about</v>

9
00:00:28.021 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>this long and there's different reaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

10
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>And if you ask people certain questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain ways,</v>

11
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>you can control the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is just the structure of being</v>

12
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be human means that you are</v>

13
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>persuadable in every single moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>the thing about magic as an example is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that magic works on everybody sleight of</v>

15
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:47.520
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter what language you</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>

17
00:00:49.231 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how intelligent you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

18
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not about what someone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about how your mind actually works.</v>

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>So knowing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that there's this whole</v>

20
00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>playbook of persuasive techniques that</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I learned when I was at the</v>

21
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Stanford persuasive technology lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that most people in Silicon Valley</v>

22
00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>and the tech industry learned as ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting your attention.</v>

23
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>So one example is we are all vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 1>to social approval.</v>

24
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>We really care what other people think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>

25
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know when you upload a new photo,</v>

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>a new profile photo of yourself on</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

27
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a moment where our mind is very</v>

28
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to knowing what other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of my new profile photo.</v>

29
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And so when we get new likes on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>profile photo facebook knowing this</v>

30
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>could actually message me and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh you have new likes on your profile</v>

31
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:46.620
<v Speaker 1>photo and we it knows that will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to that moment because we all</v>

32
00:01:46.621 --> 00:01:50.130
<v Speaker 1>really care about when we're tagged in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo or when we have a new profile</v>

33
00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:50.964
<v Speaker 1>photo.</v>

34
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.880
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is that they control the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dial,</v>

35
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>the technology companies control the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dial for when and how long your profile</v>

36
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>photo shows up on other people's news</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeds so they can orchestrate it so that</v>

37
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>other people more often end up liking</v>
<v Speaker 1>your profile photo over a delayed period</v>

38
00:02:06.721 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

39
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>So that you end up having to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently come back and see what the</v>

40
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>new lights are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

41
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is that they don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this because they're evil.</v>

42
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>They do it because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in this race for our attention.</v>

43
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>And we should also ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that necessarily such a bad thing if</v>

44
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>they're orchestrating it so that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

45
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like my,</v>

46
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>my photo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that might feel good to me,</v>

47
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>but so we have to have a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about as these technology</v>

48
00:02:33.601 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>companies use these techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these vulnerabilities in our minds,</v>

49
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is that actually aligned in good</v>

50
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>for us?</v>

51
00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>What does that ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when is that,</v>

52
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest one?</v>

53
00:02:43.081 --> 00:02:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that fair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that dishonest and unfair</v>

54
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>because they're actually manipulating</v>
<v Speaker 1>our minds in a way that doesn't add up</v>

55
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.600
<v Speaker 1>to our spending our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the screen.</v>

57
00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so another vulnerability in our mind is</v>

58
00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>something called a variable schedule</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

59
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's like a slot machine in Las</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vegas.</v>

60
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that slot machines make</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money in the United States then</v>

61
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies and theme parks combined.</v>

62
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>People become addicted to slot machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's two to three times faster</v>

63
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>than any other kind of gambling in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>casino.</v>

64
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

65
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's very simple.</v>

66
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>You just pull a lever and sometimes you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a reward as you know,</v>

67
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the more random it is and the more</v>

68
00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>variable it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more addictive it becomes.</v>

69
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And the thing is that that turns our</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone into a slot machine because every</v>

70
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>time we check our phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're playing the slot machine to see</v>

71
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>what did I get right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time that we,</v>

72
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check our email,</v>

73
00:03:45.401 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're playing the slot machine to see</v>

74
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>what did I get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did I get invited to an interview at big</v>

75
00:03:50.321 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>think or did I just get another</v>
<v Speaker 1>newsletter?</v>

76
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>or if you're on a tent dating site like</v>
<v Speaker 1>tinder and when you're swiping,</v>

78
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>each swipe is you're playing the slot</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine to see,</v>

79
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>did I get a match?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm playing the slot machine to see,</v>

80
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.590
<v Speaker 1>did I get a match?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is that this dynamic,</v>

81
00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:10.591
<v Speaker 1>these variable schedule rewards or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slot machine mechanic is so powerful but</v>

82
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best thing and addicting people</v>

83
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>and putting you in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 1>one of the original designers of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook newsfeed told me that,</v>

85
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that made the news feed work</v>

86
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:22.721
<v Speaker 1>at the very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

87
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>very beginning back in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>was in part a hardware innovation.</v>

89
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.990
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at her and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean?</v>

90
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.350
<v Speaker 1>And she said it was actually the scroll</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheel on a mouse because with the scroll</v>

91
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>wheel on the mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your hand never had to leave its resting</v>

92
00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just scroll to see the next thing</v>

93
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because before that you had to click on</v>

94
00:04:43.991 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>the down button or drag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>move your mouse and drag the Arrow down.</v>

95
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>It's called the page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way when you don't,</v>

96
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>when you can take your two fingers on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>track pad and do this or you can just</v>

97
00:04:52.751 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>scroll on a scroll wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just means your hand never has to</v>

98
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>leave its resting position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's more like a slot machine.</v>

99
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:01.990
<v Speaker 1>You can just keep swiping and playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like in Vegas where there's the</v>

100
00:05:01.991 --> 00:05:03.910
<v Speaker 1>button right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually changed it.</v>

101
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be a lever and now it's just</v>

102
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>a button.</v>

103
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>And in Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it founds,</v>

104
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>its easier just to get people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see if they get a match this way.</v>

105
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>So how much on our phones when we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>our technology,</v>

106
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>instagram is like a slot machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going to come next on the feeds?</v>

107
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>snapchat is a slot machine.</v>

108
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Each time you see the red notifications</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't know what's behind it,</v>

109
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>you're playing the slot machine when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>click on it to see what did I get right.</v>

110
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sprinkled all throughout these</v>

111
00:05:31.811 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>products because it's a very compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of getting people's attention.</v>
