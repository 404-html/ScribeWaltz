1
00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Trauma is something that's unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of our control and outside of our</v>

2
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>ability to prevent it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that really by definition is a</v>

3
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have the loss of life,</v>

4
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.510
<v Speaker 1>the loss of physical control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an injury,</v>

5
00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>the loss of emotional control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a mental health need.</v>

6
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>You can have a financial loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So loss of that nature brings trauma</v>

7
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 1>and mass casualty can take the form of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent crime or an individual's</v>

8
00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>involved in harming lots of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

9
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>It can be a natural disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a combination of those things.</v>

10
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Many times in the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't know how to respond and so</v>

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>they kind of default to what they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive to be something that's helpful.</v>

12
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>So donating clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knitting things,</v>

13
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>sending food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of thing.</v>

14
00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many situations that's not really</v>

15
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody drove a truck,</v>

16
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>a tractor trailer full of fruitcake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually parked it in the middle of the</v>

17
00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:16.900
<v Speaker 1>disaster zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget it would be funny actually,</v>

19
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in the midst of this natural</v>

20
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the right kind of resources</v>

21
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>that to big people typically need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need other kinds of resources and</v>

22
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.003
<v Speaker 1>those needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>commonly revolve around immediate safety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and security issues.</v>

24
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate,</v>

25
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>immediate emotional support and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to recover to some degree.</v>

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>What do you typically get when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>is there anything I can do for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:44.311 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine when at that casket,</v>

30
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:51.390
<v Speaker 1>when you make that comment to that widow</v>
<v Speaker 1>at her,</v>

31
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her husband's visitation,</v>

32
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>she's not thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>the grass hasn't been mowed and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortgage needs to be paid and the dog</v>

34
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 1>needs to be let out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All very practical things.</v>

35
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>And many times that's really what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to focus on.</v>

36
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>How do we discover those practical needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>by asking them</v>

37
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 1>in the aftermath of a situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are recovering emotionally,</v>

38
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financially,</v>

39
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>and many times those needs are lifelong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a person loses his or her job and</v>

40
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>can't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an issue of disability.</v>

41
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:35.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paying funeral expenses,</v>

42
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>dealing with medical expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical bills,</v>

43
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're still trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>their house payment.</v>

44
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Do they have resources to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage with that?</v>

45
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>Do they have the ability to get worker's</v>
<v Speaker 1>comp or longterm disability that can be</v>

46
00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>questionable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A manager of a compensation program is</v>

47
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>State Compensation Program told me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they consider the average cost of a</v>

48
00:02:55.861 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>shooting victim who survived to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly $50,000 that's,</v>

49
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>that's the calculable consideration for</v>
<v Speaker 1>their costs,</v>

50
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>their expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so even just financially,</v>

51
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

52
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>that's where donations can be helpful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's important for the public to</v>

53
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>be thoughtful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that whatever account that</v>

54
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.050
<v Speaker 1>you might be contributing to is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legitimate take an extra step or to</v>

55
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.780
<v Speaker 1>ask some questions to do a google search</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to make sure it's legitimate and</v>

56
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:29.044
<v Speaker 1>authentic.</v>

57
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>When you think about how we respond to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

58
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.960
<v Speaker 1>we challenge people to ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I really defining their trauma for</v>

59
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>them by the statement that I'm making?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

60
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>God wanted your loved one more than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

61
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why he took your loved one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>when you kind of examine that phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we really doing?</v>

63
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>We're defining that loss for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

64
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>Most people who are experiencing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of loss would say,</v>

65
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>that's not helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't find actually that that is</v>

66
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.800
<v Speaker 1>comforting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comforting phrases,</v>

67
00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>truly comforting phrases are really the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of phrases that empower the person</v>

68
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>to have control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big phrases that we use</v>

69
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>really in terms of crisis intervention</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

70
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry that your loved one died</v>
<v Speaker 1>and use that person's name.</v>

71
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry that bill died because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

72
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>we're affirming the value of that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they've lost and we're affirming</v>

73
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>the reality of what they've experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

74
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>the easiest thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>

75
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>is to say nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can be helpful just to be with</v>

76
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't know what to say,</v>

77
00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>you can simply say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here with you.</v>

78
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I just want to support you.</v>
