1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>So the prefrontal cortex is guiding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

2
00:00:04.601 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we are discussing screens,</v>

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>metaphoric screens in different spaces</v>
<v Speaker 1>where where the show is going on or</v>

4
00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>auditory and tactile and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what is interesting is to think</v>

5
00:00:21.221 --> 00:00:26.221
<v Speaker 1>that those spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those performance spaces are separate.</v>

6
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>They're extremely sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to be in terms of brain</v>

7
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

8
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>very modern in evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to have some of the most</v>

9
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated circuitry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But take for example,</v>

10
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the visual system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our judicial system is an amazing</v>

11
00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>instrument and of course the visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>system that allows us to perceive right</v>

12
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>now something with the fine perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I got,</v>

13
00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I can have over the depth of the color</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your sweater and so on.</v>

14
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that is extremely sophisticated,</v>

15
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>but then surrounding that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

16
00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>let's consider that like an island and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then surrounding that there's an ocean</v>

17
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>and that ocean is filled with knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how different parts,</v>

18
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>different components of past perceptions</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been put together in time when they</v>

19
00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>were occurring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that that's an</v>

20
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:33.391
<v Speaker 1>interesting analogy is the analogy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strings that pull the puppets are in the</v>

21
00:01:34.751 --> 00:01:39.751
<v Speaker 1>performance spaces and so it's not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should privilege the performance</v>

22
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>spaces as the thing that matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that matters very much because</v>

23
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:49.201
<v Speaker 1>that's where our consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our consciousness is actually occurring</v>

24
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.420
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's occurring.</v>

25
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>They're only by the grace of this trains</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are being pulled from the other</v>

26
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>space this elsewhere where you have what</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to call convergence divergence,</v>

27
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>which are end of themselves.</v>

28
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pause for a second because this</v>

29
00:02:11.351 --> 00:02:13.650
<v Speaker 2>convergence divergence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 2>what you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making a broader category for</v>

32
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 2>parts of the brain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I recognize,</v>

33
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 2>but you are putting it together in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>larger context as I understand,</v>

34
00:02:28.061 --> 00:02:30.310
<v Speaker 2>after reading your book yesterday.</v>

35
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to.</v>

37
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to give that info.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your spirit has tremendously anyway,</v>

38
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

39
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>that's a very interesting because from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutral standpoint,</v>

40
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could even say that these structures</v>

41
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>are in of themselves rather dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they know anything</v>

42
00:02:56.461 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>consciously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they know is that they have a sort</v>

43
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>of internal testimony of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous occurrence,</v>

44
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>occurrence of certain things at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain point.</v>

45
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I will,</v>

46
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow remember talking to you today,</v>

47
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will think of a certain words that you</v>

48
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty simple the sentence you just said</v>

49
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>about the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I probably will remember,</v>

50
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some form and I will remember the</v>

51
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>fact that you have this sweater that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>presume is spink,</v>

52
00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>although I'm not very good with colored</v>
<v Speaker 1>pink.</v>

53
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

54
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the pink and the white shirt and</v>

55
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>your beautiful blonde hair.</v>

56
00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do I put this thing together?</v>

57
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.890
<v Speaker 1>This is occurring right now and I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>recording the simultaneity of occurrence</v>

58
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>of Your Voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of certain ideas and certain</v>

59
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are in different places.</v>

60
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>So we need to find in the brain a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where signals about all these different</v>

61
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.880
<v Speaker 1>things can come together in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make a record of the,</v>

62
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

63
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>the proximity and simultaneity of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>in time.</v>

64
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Temporality.</v>

65
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:29.381
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

66
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:32.710
<v Speaker 1>we'll go there next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once that happens,</v>

67
00:04:32.711 --> 00:04:37.711
<v Speaker 1>once that record is made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it is possible to reactivate the</v>

68
00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:43.261
<v Speaker 1>record and to come back into the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>regions where this is happening to us</v>

69
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reconstruct something that he's</v>

70
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>going to be a paler version of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original,</v>

71
00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to relate to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>

72
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

73
00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
<v Speaker 1>gets us into one very important issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the issue that you don't have</v>

74
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a facsimile memory of.</v>

75
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a memory.</v>

77
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to have a polaroid</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

78
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>You right now talking to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No soundtrack.</v>

79
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to have is all these bits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pieces of information with which I</v>

80
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>will be allowed to reconstruct something</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this moment.</v>

81
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>But of course the reconstruction is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be entirely accurate.</v>

82
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>And who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that in time I may even make a</v>

83
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:37.471
<v Speaker 1>confusion and I could be asked the court</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say what you're wearing.</v>

84
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>And I could say that you were wearing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blue eye.</v>

85
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.170
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is quite</v>

86
00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.003
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

87
00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.090
<v Speaker 2>that the fact that our brains and our</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories are not like recording devices</v>

88
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 2>like film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

89
00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is how we,</v>

90
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.410
<v Speaker 2>some significant errors and those errors</v>
<v Speaker 2>also can be created by an emotion</v>

91
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 2>attached to the experience so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can even entirely invert a memory</v>

92
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.010
<v Speaker 2>depending on the motivation in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't mean conscious motivation,</v>

93
00:06:15.861 --> 00:06:20.861
<v Speaker 2>but they deeply embodied a drive or push</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes that can have an emotional</v>

94
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:26.360
<v Speaker 2>valence that will change memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

95
00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:27.520
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the testimonies in court very often</v>

97
00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>affected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

98
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all sorts of misattribution</v>

99
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:38.190
<v Speaker 1>errors in versions of time sequence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>

100
00:06:38.191 --> 00:06:41.520
<v Speaker 1>And that's because we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmic medium.</v>

101
00:06:41.521 --> 00:06:46.521
<v Speaker 1>We don't have cellulite with an optic</v>
<v Speaker 1>soundtrack attached to it.</v>

102
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>What we have is this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated mechanism of transforming</v>

103
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.200
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like coding.</v>

104
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 1>You have this little bits and pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are occurring in time and then you</v>

105
00:06:59.641 --> 00:07:03.540
<v Speaker 1>have the possibility of reconstruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>or react reactivation,</v>

106
00:07:03.541 --> 00:07:05.280
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

107
00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:06.240
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very intriguing.</v>

108
00:07:06.241 --> 00:07:07.950
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely economic.</v>

109
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:08.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

110
00:07:08.641 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>

111
00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:11.640
<v Speaker 1>Whenever it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.790
<v Speaker 1>does things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm facilely and a leisurely and you</v>

113
00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:18.060
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

114
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.770
<v Speaker 1>if there's no need to repeat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvent the wheel,</v>

115
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.150
<v Speaker 2>well this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is very important for,</v>

116
00:07:27.151 --> 00:07:30.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perception because perception,</v>

117
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 2>the way we perceive things has to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>with deep learning in the brain.</v>

118
00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.690
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite philosophers who,</v>

119
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.150
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned a footnote in your most</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent book,</v>

120
00:07:42.151 --> 00:07:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Molly's mellow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pointy,</v>

121
00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 2>talks about perception of something he</v>
<v Speaker 2>calls stereotypes.</v>

122
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.530
<v Speaker 2>And in neuroscience there's a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea,</v>

123
00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 2>which is that the brain also will take</v>
<v Speaker 2>in information according to its own</v>

124
00:07:58.891 --> 00:07:59.724
<v Speaker 2>expectations.</v>

125
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

126
00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we don't,</v>

127
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just that we have memory of the</v>

128
00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>things that we have been living through</v>
<v Speaker 1>since we were born.</v>

129
00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:14.650
<v Speaker 1>We have past memories that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherited a through a whole history of</v>

130
00:08:15.891 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>evolution before us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in fact I have memories of things</v>

131
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>that our fore runners have been doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

132
00:08:23.151 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just talking about the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>four runners,</v>

133
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 1>four runners that go all the way into</v>
<v Speaker 1>reptiles and single cells,</v>

134
00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that have been done in a certain</v>

135
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:38.240
<v Speaker 1>way in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life forms,</v>

136
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>in that course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

137
00:08:40.431 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>been memorized by the biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems.</v>

138
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:43.560
<v Speaker 1>We.</v>
