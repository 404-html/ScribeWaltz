00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Spiritualities to experience</v>

2
00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is universal,</v>

3
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 2>and when we experienced that domain of</v>
<v Speaker 2>awareness,</v>

4
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 2>which is beyond our skin and capsulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>eagle identities,</v>

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 2>then we have the spontaneous</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of love,</v>

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 2>compassion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 2>it becomes our nature not as a moral</v>
<v Speaker 2>dictate,</v>

8
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 2>but something which is a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>expression of ourselves.</v>

9
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 2>It also gives us insight into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanics of how intention orchestrates</v>

10
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 2>its own fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spiritualities,</v>

11
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 2>also a sense of connection with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative power of the universe,</v>

12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.880
<v Speaker 2>the mystery that we call God a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by having a sense of connection to</v>

13
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:58.491
<v Speaker 2>that greater power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we gain self esteem and have the ability</v>

14
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:03.501
<v Speaker 2>to create because we align ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the elements and forces of creative</v>

15
00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We begin to realize that the universe is</v>

16
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is conscious,</v>

17
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>that it's evolving and our personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution is somehow linked to the</v>

18
00:01:15.751 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 2>evolution of the mystery that we call</v>
<v Speaker 2>them</v>

19
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>experiential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In</v>

20
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.180
<v Speaker 2>India it is trucked out to yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people have a misunderstanding</v>

21
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 2>of yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They equate it with the physical</v>

22
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:40.061
<v Speaker 2>postures that they do in a yoga studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are one component of yoga,</v>

23
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 2>but yoga classically is divided into</v>
<v Speaker 2>four types and they have to do with four</v>

24
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:53.831
<v Speaker 2>basic instincts that human beings have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being feeling,</v>

25
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and doing.</v>

26
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 2>So the yoga of being his meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self reflection,</v>

27
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to shut off the world of the</v>

28
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>sentences and go to the source of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own thought.</v>

29
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 2>It's called Raja Yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

30
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.070
<v Speaker 2>the second yoga is the Yoga of love</v>
<v Speaker 2>through relationship and understanding</v>

31
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 2>that love is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the ultimate truth at the heart of</v>

32
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 2>creation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that through relationship we can</v>

33
00:02:23.091 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 2>move progressively from attraction to</v>
<v Speaker 2>infatuation,</v>

34
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>to communion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to intimacy,</v>

35
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 2>to passion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to detachment,</v>

36
00:02:32.661 --> 00:02:35.780
<v Speaker 2>to ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is our ground state,</v>

37
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.790
<v Speaker 2>the exaltation of our spirit.</v>

38
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 2>So love and relationship is a second</v>
<v Speaker 2>means of experiencing spirituality.</v>

39
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.040
<v Speaker 2>If somebody doesn't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirituality,</v>

40
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.300
<v Speaker 2>ask them if they've ever been in love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the experience of spirituality.</v>

41
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 2>That third way of understanding yoga or</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the experience of spirit is</v>

42
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 2>through service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you perform service without any</v>

43
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 2>selfish motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called Karma Yoga.</v>

44
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Then you also get in touch with the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>domain of awareness that we call spirit.</v>

45
00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And the fourth way of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>spirituality is,</v>

46
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the intellect,</v>

47
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 2>through the mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through science,</v>

48
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>to understanding how the laws of nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

49
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 2>Because the laws of nature are in fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind.</v>
