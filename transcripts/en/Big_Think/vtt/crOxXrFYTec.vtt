00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.140
<v Speaker 1>Hi Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know me as a producer at big</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:08.150
<v Speaker 1>thing and my question for you is my</v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite question for all of our desks,</v>

3
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 1>which is that keeps you up at night.</v>

4
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 2>What keeps me up at night?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Climate Change,</v>

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 2>climate change keeps me up at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everywhere I looked,</v>

6
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 2>there were opportunities to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing climate change and everywhere</v>

7
00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:29.611
<v Speaker 2>I look we're not doing it and by we I</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean not just humankind writ large,</v>

8
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 2>but my United States where I grew up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I went to engineering school where</v>

9
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 2>I worked as an engineer trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world better for somebody and we are</v>

10
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:43.711
<v Speaker 2>missing all these opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just crazy making and this is by</v>

11
00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 2>the way why I'm very proud to be the CEO</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Planetary Society.</v>

12
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 2>We are accomplishing something in space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are getting things done in space and</v>

13
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 2>I claim that space exploration is good</v>
<v Speaker 2>for everybody.</v>

14
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's not the Apollo era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not devoting 10 percent of the</v>

15
00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:09.181
<v Speaker 2>world's largest government</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding to this one thing.</v>

16
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 2>We're spending about point four percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>be nice if it were point five percent,</v>

17
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 2>but we're spending a reasonable amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our intellect and treasure on</v>

18
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 2>learning about the cosmos and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Planetary Society works very hard to</v>

19
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 2>direct that expenditure in what we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the best,</v>

20
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 2>most efficient way today.</v>

21
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now is the press conference about</v>

22
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 2>what instruments will be put on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europa mission.</v>

23
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.440
<v Speaker 2>This is a spacecraft going to the moon</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Jupiter called Europa.</v>

24
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:43.150
<v Speaker 2>Looking to see if it's habitable are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a chance that are living things</v>

25
00:01:43.151 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 2>they're such a discovery would change</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

26
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.460
<v Speaker 2>With that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate change keeps me up at night,</v>

27
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>but the opportunities that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing,</v>

28
00:01:50.501 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 2>it's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making these people who are in denial of</v>

29
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

30
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>if you're a denial list and this will</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably find its way to you and you</v>

31
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 2>will post these crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mean spirited comments about me and</v>

32
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 2>knock yourself out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine with that.</v>

33
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 2>Brings you joy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

34
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody told you that there is</v>
<v Speaker 2>no connection whatsoever between smoking</v>

35
00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 2>and cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you vote for that person?</v>

36
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Would that be somebody you trust now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 years after that discovery was made?</v>

37
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the connection between humans and</v>

38
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:33.760
<v Speaker 2>climate change is about that strong and</v>
<v Speaker 2>by some very reasonable modern</v>

39
00:02:33.761 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 2>statistical reckoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slightly stronger.</v>

40
00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a denier out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I strongly encourage you to cut it out.</v>

41
00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Just change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get to work.</v>

42
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody more passionate about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment than the guy who just built</v>

43
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 2>his log cabin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nobody who wants you to quit</v>

44
00:02:52.391 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 2>smoking more strongly than the guy who</v>
<v Speaker 2>just quit.</v>

45
00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>Or the Gal who just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no more antismoking advocate</v>

46
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 2>stronger than the person who just quit</v>
<v Speaker 2>smoking.</v>

47
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a denier out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could change and we embrace you and</v>

48
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:13.591
<v Speaker 2>we could get to work and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities are renewable energy,</v>

49
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 2>transmission of electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Electricity is like magical energy,</v>

50
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 2>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>storage or energy storage.</v>

51
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 2>And then if that's from an engineering</v>
<v Speaker 2>standpoint,</v>

52
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:30.121
<v Speaker 2>and then the huge opportunity is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a system where people have to pay</v>

53
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:35.341
<v Speaker 2>for the carbon dioxide they create and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then take those funds that,</v>

54
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 2>that treasure and redirect it into basic</v>
<v Speaker 2>research so that we can,</v>

55
00:03:40.271 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>dare I say it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>change the world,</v>

56
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 2>and then I could sleep at night.</v>
