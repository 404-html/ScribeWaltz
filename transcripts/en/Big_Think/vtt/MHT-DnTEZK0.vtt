1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I am very good at hiring because I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of mistakes.</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>I learned to look at the specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and look for the most</v>

3
00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>important traits in them and ignore</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>

4
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>especially the resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send you in the wrong direction.</v>

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I learned through trial and error what</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes a great manager,</v>

6
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>what makes a great salesperson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's who I always are.</v>

7
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to hire a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>salespeople for your organization,</v>

8
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>I found that I looked for the same three</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in every single person I hired.</v>

9
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>I wanted someone who was insecure with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

10
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>approve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If somebody walks in,</v>

11
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>they're cocky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never become.</v>

12
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Your great salespeople.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might top 10 salespeople making millions</v>

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>of dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year came to my office in</v>

14
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swearing.</v>

15
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>They would never have another good year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

16
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>It was ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were insecure enough to think</v>

17
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>it could never happen again.</v>

18
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>You want an insecure person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're hiring a salesperson with</v>

19
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>something to prove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You also want someone who has a positive</v>

20
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>attitude in every way because you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens.</v>

21
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>A positive person when they get hit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales is all about getting hit and</v>

22
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>knocked down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they spend very little time feeling</v>

23
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>sorry for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get right back up that backout you</v>

24
00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>almost need a low Iq like hit me again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit me again,</v>

25
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 1>hit me again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great salesperson and then you</v>

26
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>need the work ethic to go with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is great and sale unless they</v>

27
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>work like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the three traits I look for</v>

28
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:36.731
<v Speaker 1>in every great salesperson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I look for in a manager is someone</v>

29
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be loyal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean heck,</v>

30
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to build a giant house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is my business on a shaky</v>

31
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how far am I going to get?</v>

32
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 1>I need a structure with a footing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyal as can be,</v>

33
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>is going to stand there through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick and thin.</v>

34
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 1>I also need someone who believes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to succeed.</v>

35
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>I need someone with a positive attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always a positive attitude because you</v>

36
00:02:00.691 --> 00:02:03.300
<v Speaker 1>know what I find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find a manager with a positive</v>

37
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>attitude is always going to find a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get to where you want them to go.</v>

38
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>A mark of a good manager is someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's organized.</v>

39
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>I always ask everyone I'm interviewing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an interview.</v>

40
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>On a scale of one to 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you rate yourself as an</v>

41
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>organized person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never hire anyone who says nine or 10.</v>

42
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>I want the guy who says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

43
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm bad at 12.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A manager without follow through is</v>

44
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be able to give the command.</v>

45
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>They get it done and they don't forget</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it when something distracts them.</v>

46
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>A manager always follows through.</v>
