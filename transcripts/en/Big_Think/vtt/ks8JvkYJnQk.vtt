1
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't obsessed with a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly didn't see the hand of Iraq</v>

2
00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>and al Qaeda or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt that,</v>

3
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly we had our hands full with</v>

4
00:00:19.571 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We needed to do that.</v>

5
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like I say,</v>

6
00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:26.080
<v Speaker 1>I think we've done it reasonably well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could have done it better.</v>

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I felt that Saddam had to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt it was a good idea to go after</v>

8
00:00:30.581 --> 00:00:35.581
<v Speaker 1>him whether we needed to do it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole other matter.</v>

9
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

10
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:38.860
<v Speaker 1>we had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:41.090
<v Speaker 1>this coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't the same coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the coalition on Afghanistan.</v>

13
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That was clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>another point was that I believed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

15
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>that there was a problem with weapons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass destruction and it was meant to me</v>

16
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a matter of connecting dots.</v>

17
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a guy,</v>

18
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Saddam Hussein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who detect five other countries,</v>

19
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>a heat attack by rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arac,</v>

20
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

21
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kuwait.</v>

22
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's interesting that out of the</v>

23
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three were other Arab countries.</v>

24
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 1>And of course he'd attacked his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and Curtis,</v>

25
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Stan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd used weapons of mass destruction.</v>

26
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And he was giving $25,000 to every</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestinian family that had a suicide</v>

27
00:01:18.491 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>bomber in the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a connection to terrorism,</v>

28
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:26.230
<v Speaker 1>there was a proclivity to attack others</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a desire to develop</v>

29
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.030
<v Speaker 1>weapons of mass destruction and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

30
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>So if you connected the dots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw that this guy really was a</v>

31
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>threat and he was behaving as if he were</v>
<v Speaker 1>a threat.</v>

32
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't want to let inspectors in and</v>

33
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 1>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>but my sense of it was we should've gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

35
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>knocked him out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got now we could have done that until we</v>

36
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>disbanded the Iraqi military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once we disbanded the Iraqi military and</v>

37
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.240
<v Speaker 1>disbanded the bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

38
00:01:52.241 --> 00:01:53.620
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no structure.</v>

39
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 1>There was no country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were stuck</v>

40
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.140
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

41
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a great believer in</v>

42
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>nation building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.360
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>everybody should be prepared to modify</v>
<v Speaker 1>their views.</v>

45
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:10.170
<v Speaker 1>And Afghanistan taught me that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some nation building and as did</v>

46
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Boston here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but you can't do it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still don't believe the United States</v>

48
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>is best equipped to do nation building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a terrible record at it.</v>

49
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>We've done it well twice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Japan.</v>

50
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>But first we flattened them both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>that's not the sort of thing we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to do in the future.</v>

52
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Nuke somebody or flatten somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>addressed and type thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're not good at it.</v>

54
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>We're not colonialists we don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonial office.</v>

55
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So for gun to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to do it in concert with others,</v>

56
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but really in concert with others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan led me to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't disband the bath and the Iraqi</v>

59
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>military in concert with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From what I understand,</v>

60
00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:56.310
<v Speaker 1>we didn't even disband them in concert</v>
<v Speaker 1>with [inaudible] own administration.</v>

61
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.530
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
