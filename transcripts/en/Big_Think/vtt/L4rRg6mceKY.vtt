1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 2>well I would say a smoking would be one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.940
<v Speaker 2>eating to caloric excess would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

4
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.353
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 2>being sedentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 2>not moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not exercising would be a third.</v>

7
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.190
<v Speaker 2>We didn't talk about exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's ample evidence that exercise</v>

8
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>is beneficial.</v>

9
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:37.783
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I think the other thing is what we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just talking about,</v>

11
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 2>your attitude and mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

12
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 2>being focused on negativity would be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fourth and I think the last one,</v>

14
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again is what would be a more or</v>

15
00:00:55.411 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 2>less in this lifestyle area would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress level.</v>

16
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 2>This level of stress that you maintain</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a day to day basis.</v>

17
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>So I believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others a believe in something called</v>

18
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:16.011
<v Speaker 2>Hormesis</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormesis means is that a lot of stress</v>

19
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 2>is a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no stress is also a bad thing and</v>

20
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:29.481
<v Speaker 2>the optimum is something in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that you're engaged on a daily basis.</v>

21
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 2>It revved up your functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.000
<v Speaker 2>But you feel as though you're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

23
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 2>And I think finding that balance that me</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

24
00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

25
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 2>is probably very important in</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining a mental health and physical</v>

26
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that would be my,</v>

27
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 2>my big five.</v>
