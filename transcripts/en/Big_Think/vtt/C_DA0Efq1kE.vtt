1
00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Waves of immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have fresh and refreshed America.</v>

2
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You can see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this wave of Hispanic</v>

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.430
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refreshing America,</v>

4
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>just as the European immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so of the 20th century refreshed</v>

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have such a tremendous capacity</v>

6
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>to take people in and make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

7
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American system is so,</v>

8
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so strong that it is an ease.</v>

9
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes it,</v>

10
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>it reacts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also,</v>

11
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.240
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

12
00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reshapes itself a little bit,</v>

13
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's so encompassing and to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain extent,</v>

14
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>so welcoming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the way Americans field,</v>

15
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>despite the debate about immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days,</v>

16
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>if you look at about the way Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel about,</v>

17
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing people in and being an</v>

18
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>the view is if you come here and want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be an American,</v>

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and act like an American,</v>

21
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>you are an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is certainly not the view in large</v>

22
00:01:07.171 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in many,</v>

23
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 1>many Western countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

25
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>in the public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the view of the public's money.</v>

26
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 2>The.</v>
