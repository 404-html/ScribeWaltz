1
00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Global migration is a pervasive reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have more migraines than ever in</v>

2
00:00:11.351 --> 00:00:13.420
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even have more migrants as a</v>

3
00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the world population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just creeping up to about three plus</v>

4
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 1>percent of the world population are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live outside of their country</v>

5
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>of origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ex pats,</v>

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>economic migrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call them,</v>

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.980
<v Speaker 1>and that's 3% of a much larger world</v>
<v Speaker 1>population than was the case in 1950</v>

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're approaching a world of seven and a</v>

9
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>8 billion people,</v>

10
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>more than 3% of whom are now migrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's nearly 300 million people who</v>

11
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:46.450
<v Speaker 1>are living outside their country of</v>
<v Speaker 1>origin who may be temporary.</v>

12
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:50.020
<v Speaker 1>They may be permanent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there's global migrant</v>

13
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>horde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

14
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.030
<v Speaker 1>is always chasing the supply chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always chasing jobs,</v>

15
00:00:55.031 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>always chasing a better life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always chasing good cities to live in</v>

16
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most places in the world are reducing</v>

17
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>the barriers to entry for migrants.</v>

18
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>In 2015 Europe led in 1 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>migrants,</v>

19
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Particularly a political refugees from</v>

20
00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they're talking about some limited</v>

21
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:20.701
<v Speaker 1>migration controls from the Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 1>and within their own territories across</v>

22
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:24.220
<v Speaker 1>European borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very limited process because</v>

23
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>European countries are of course largely</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to each other and generally very</v>

24
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:29.920
<v Speaker 1>integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their supply chains,</v>

25
00:01:29.921 --> 00:01:32.410
<v Speaker 1>their economies are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interdependent.</v>

26
00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>But even if Europe were to impose very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strict migration restrictions,</v>

27
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>that does not tell us about the global</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

28
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>The same year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2015 ozzy on the Association of</v>

29
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Southeast Asian Nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 10 countries and 700 million</v>

30
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:52.180
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is greater than the population of</v>

31
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past an ozzy on Economic Community and</v>

32
00:01:56.021 --> 00:02:01.021
<v Speaker 1>ratified the treaty to allow the free</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobility of labor across it's countries.</v>

33
00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So even if in one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 million people in Europe decided</v>

34
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that they want to limit mobility the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same year,</v>

35
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.130
<v Speaker 1>700 million people in Asia decided they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to increase mobility.</v>

36
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.730
<v Speaker 1>So only from a totally euro centric</v>
<v Speaker 1>standpoint,</v>

37
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.170
<v Speaker 1>our walls going up and migration becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult.</v>

38
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>That's not actually what is happening on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a worldwide basis.</v>

39
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going into a period that I</v>

40
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.280
<v Speaker 1>described as a great demographic</v>
<v Speaker 1>dilution,</v>

41
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>even a genetic dilution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is so much more intermingling of</v>

42
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>different ethnic populations happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world that there are very few</v>

43
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>countries left that you could even</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide define as nation states.</v>

44
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of a nation state as a country</v>

45
00:02:46.001 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 1>where 85 or 90% of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>belongs to the same ethnic group.</v>

46
00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>The number of nation states is declining</v>
<v Speaker 1>because more and more countries are</v>

47
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>becoming more ethnically diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in Europe,</v>

48
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>where the of the nation state really</v>
<v Speaker 1>began,</v>

49
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle Ages and into the modern</v>

50
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 1>nation states of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

51
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>of Western Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today there you see a growing percentage</v>

52
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>of migrants and therefore those</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries are no longer even nation</v>

53
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in fact,</v>

54
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>we have this genetic intermingling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this particularly in global</v>

55
00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:24.781
<v Speaker 1>cities that are melting pots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like Singapore or Hong Kong or</v>

56
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:30.031
<v Speaker 1>Dubai or Toronto or London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places where the foreign born percentage</v>

57
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 40% 50% in the case of Dubai,</v>

58
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>even 85 or 90% of the residents actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't come from that place.</v>

59
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.200
<v Speaker 1>And so we see literally mingling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnicities mixed the birth children and</v>

60
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.721
<v Speaker 1>this mingling of populations that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>never taken place before at this rapid</v>

61
00:03:52.091 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

62
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560
<v Speaker 1>populism is a feature of our politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a backlash against immigration</v>

63
00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:03.841
<v Speaker 1>to some degree in quite a few places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the global picture is one of more</v>

64
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>mass migration and integration across</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

65
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>It is very important for us to not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>deterministic about geography and</v>

66
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>instead to always take into account the</v>
<v Speaker 1>layer of connectivity on top of</v>

67
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>geography and the impact that has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

68
00:04:20.291 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between political</v>
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>

69
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>which is our nations and boundaries and</v>
<v Speaker 1>political barriers and functional</v>

70
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>geography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the connections that we build</v>

71
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>across those boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To understand the relationship between</v>

72
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>any two countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to take into account not just</v>

73
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>the political boundary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the infrastructural connectivity.</v>

74
00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Then obvious example is the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States and Mexico.</v>

75
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>It may be the case hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one day if some particular person</v>

76
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>were to become president of the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

77
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.130
<v Speaker 1>he may wish to erect some kind of a wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the border between the two countries,</v>

78
00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>which might have the impact of reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inflow into America.</v>

79
00:05:01.151 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Have a very small number of illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>migrants into the country.</v>

80
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Does that tell you everything you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know about us?</v>

81
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Mexico relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by a long shot.</v>

82
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>u s Mexico relations consist of the</v>

83
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the world's two or three</v>

84
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>most heavily legally transited borders</v>
<v Speaker 1>with hundreds of thousands of people</v>

85
00:05:22.001 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>moving across every single day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the largest trade</v>

86
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>relationships in the world with more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a half,</v>

87
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>a bit more than um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several hundred billion dollars of</v>

88
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:36.151
<v Speaker 1>annual trade every single year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a two countries that are massively</v>

89
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:39.850
<v Speaker 1>investing in each other's economies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the United States now</v>

90
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>investing more and more in the Mexican</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy supply in the Mexican energy</v>

91
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Mexican automotive sector,</v>

92
00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and of course there is still very large</v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of demographic and ideational</v>

93
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>and communications and electronics flows</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are happening between the two</v>

94
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>countries all the time.</v>

95
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:02.290
<v Speaker 1>That is u s Mexico relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not whether or not there is a wall or</v>

96
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>not a wall on the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you multiply that by every single</v>

97
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>border in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand that there is so</v>

98
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 1>much more connectivity between</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

99
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Then there is division and that's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're talking about countries that</v>

100
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:22.520
<v Speaker 1>border each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only 25% of world trade is between</v>

101
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:27.521
<v Speaker 1>countries that share a border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>75% of world trade is between countries</v>

102
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>that are not physically connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other at all.</v>

103
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.410
<v Speaker 1>There's obviously lots of connectivity</v>
<v Speaker 1>between all of our societies.</v>

104
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would 75% of our world trade be</v>

105
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>taking place at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

106
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.600
<v Speaker 1>the value of world trade in services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we zap rather than ship is</v>

107
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 1>now more valuable than the trade in</v>
<v Speaker 1>goods,</v>

108
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>things that we physically put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>containers and ship.</v>

109
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about the full,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost total digital connectivity that</v>

110
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:58.460
<v Speaker 1>is encompassing the world with the rapid</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread of mobile communications and the</v>

111
00:06:58.461 --> 00:07:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more you realize that even if you</v>

112
00:07:01.731 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>can't physically see the connectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is such an intimal intimate part of</v>

113
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>our lives and our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that throughout history,</v>

114
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 1>the great thriving commercial and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>political centers of the world have been</v>

115
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse,</v>

116
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 1>tolerant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>melting pots.</v>

117
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 1>Ancient Greece was like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Roman empire was like this.</v>

118
00:07:23.121 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>The Ottoman empire was a very diverse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:07:26.061 --> 00:07:28.850
<v Speaker 1>empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great trading centers of European</v>

120
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly Amsterdam.</v>

121
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>We're very diverse and inclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>London during the British empire,</v>

122
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>welcomed in people from all across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Commonwealth and today the great global</v>

123
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 1>cities of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as New York or Los Angeles,</v>

124
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:46.841
<v Speaker 1>or London or Dubai or Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or all very diverse cities in an age</v>

125
00:07:47.361 --> 00:07:52.361
<v Speaker 1>where we pride cities on being thriving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and creative and innovative and having</v>

126
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>services as a dominant part of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

127
00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Those sources of dynamism come from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to tall and being tolerant and open</v>

128
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 1>to immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we find a real correlation between</v>

129
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:08.870
<v Speaker 1>the great cities in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desirable places to live,</v>

130
00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>and their openness to immigration and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talent and diversity.</v>

131
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrate.</v>
