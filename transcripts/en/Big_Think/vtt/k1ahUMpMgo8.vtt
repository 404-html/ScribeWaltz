00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.870
<v Speaker 1>Hey Chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really cool question about</v>

2
00:00:12.871 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>different types of rocket engines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether there might be a rocket engine</v>

3
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>coming in the future that uses very</v>
<v Speaker 1>little energy.</v>

4
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.660
<v Speaker 1>One of the big challenges of getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything into space right now is you</v>

5
00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>need to get it up out of the earth's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>And really the only way we had to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is with fairly traditional rockets.</v>

7
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>They use either solid rocket fuel or</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquid rocket fuel,</v>

8
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a huge amount of energy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get off the surface of the earth.</v>

9
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Right now we don't really have any</v>
<v Speaker 1>better way to get things off the surface</v>

10
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>of the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things change once you get up into</v>

11
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are the things that I'm really</v>

12
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 1>excited about is something called an ion</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive,</v>

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.200
<v Speaker 1>and NASA uses these right now and an eye</v>
<v Speaker 1>on drive generates a tiny little bit of</v>

14
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>thrust.</v>

15
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost similar to just taking your</v>

16
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>hand and blowing on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about that much thrust,</v>

17
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>but you can turn an eye on drive on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can leave it on for years.</v>

18
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>So even though it's a tiny little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrust,</v>

19
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>some of the fastest spacecraft at NASA</v>
<v Speaker 1>now operates use ion drives.</v>

20
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite missions is the dawn</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>

21
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>which is actually serving the larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>asteroids in the asteroid belt and went</v>

22
00:01:15.481 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>out to the asteroid Vesta and vestas is</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 300 miles across.</v>

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Took wonderful pictures of Vesta and</v>

24
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>then it went onto the asteroid ceres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is actually the largest of the</v>

25
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually close to 700 miles across.</v>

26
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>And the images it returned if series</v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely amazing and it was able</v>

27
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>to go from one asteroid to another</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it had this ion drive that it</v>

28
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>could leave on for years.</v>

29
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>And even though the thrust is tiny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep that thrust going day after day,</v>

30
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>month after month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>

31
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>you can get up to many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many tens of thousands of miles an hour.</v>

32
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>So the way an eye on drive works is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically can even use just electricity.</v>

33
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>It creates ions by actually ripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart molecules into charged particles</v>

34
00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.090
<v Speaker 1>and then accelerating them out the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the spacecraft.</v>

35
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>And really all you need is electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even run this on solar panels if</v>

36
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could actually have an entire</v>

37
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:10.890
<v Speaker 1>rocket engine up in space that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>powered simply by solar energy and</v>

38
00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>accelerating ions out the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spacecraft.</v>

39
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem is we don't know how to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ion engine to actually launch</v>

40
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>something into space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that,</v>

41
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you need a lot of thrust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to actually get out of the</v>

42
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>strong gravity well of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now we sort of have these dual</v>

43
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>strategies for rocket engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One that gets you up off the earth,</v>

44
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>and those are pretty traditional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then once you get into space,</v>

45
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>turn on your ion drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave it on,</v>

46
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.830
<v Speaker 1>get yourself going 30,000 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit at a time,</v>

47
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>and you never need to turn it off.</v>

48
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
