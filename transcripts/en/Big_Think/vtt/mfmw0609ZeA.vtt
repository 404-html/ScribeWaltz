1
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.061
<v Speaker 1>Well of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>China and the US have very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about intellectual property</v>

3
00:00:09.571 --> 00:00:10.404
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about copying and things like that.</v>

5
00:00:12.931 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a very foundationally,</v>

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>things that in the u s are completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>taboo in China might be wrong or maybe</v>

7
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>even not legal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not taboo.</v>

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can ask yourself,</v>

9
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that,</v>

10
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is,</v>

11
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is building a building that looks just</v>

12
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>like a chateau in France?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>why did we not do that here in the West?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

14
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.351
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might do it,</v>

15
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>but it'd be an amusement park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be something.</v>

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Would you know that you did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

17
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Tacky,</v>

18
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do we think it's tacky?</v>

19
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Where in the east are considered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine.</v>

20
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.371
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.204
<v Speaker 1>you can have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very elaborate,</v>

23
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copy of a,</v>

24
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>of a French chateau.</v>

25
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can pour $50 million into it.</v>

26
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>You can use the exact stone that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>used in the original and,</v>

27
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:01.531
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>and how this copy in every way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>

29
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>And in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's seen as a great thing,</v>

30
00:01:06.511 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like no one would say,</v>

31
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spend $50 million on this copy in</v>

32
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>the u s we would never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

33
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because we have two different</v>

34
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>models of self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

35
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.091
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>if it sees something which is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small,</v>

37
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>it's homage and this goes right down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the educational level.</v>

39
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the idea,</v>

40
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

41
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>in our education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very much trying to coax out of</v>

42
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>their unique vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

44
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

45
00:01:34.021 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Asia,</v>

46
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea that actually there are many</v>
<v Speaker 1>great ideas kind of help out there,</v>

47
00:01:38.941 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>all around you in your culture and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe before you think about how you can</v>

48
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>put your own stamp on things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should absorb those ideas.</v>

49
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important.</v>

50
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.310
<v Speaker 1>So things that to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>you just don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>to them it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

53
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>they're much more playful attitude and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll say toward these things.</v>

55
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.480
<v Speaker 1>And so in order to absorb those ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:02:00.481 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often you irritate,</v>

57
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So painters start,</v>

58
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find a great painter.</v>

59
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm a painter who with whom they feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpatico and they,</v>

60
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>they copied those paintings and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

61
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.840
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know we think of copying,</v>

62
00:02:15.841 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>we think of it's very kind of mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

63
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually they're trying to</v>

64
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>internalize the greatness of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>painting.</v>

65
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

66
00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:28.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not a mechanical process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an organic process.</v>

67
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

68
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking in this influence.</v>

69
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately they want to add to the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition that they are signed up for.</v>

70
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately they want their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

71
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution to be theirs.</v>

72
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be singular.</v>

73
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>But they see that as coming after they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have master.</v>

74
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>They're great tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 1>And mastering it through imitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through memorization is completely fine.</v>

76
00:02:56.101 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>And like I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sign of Amash.</v>

77
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Now you can only imagine a culture where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this very longstanding</v>

78
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>tradition of education through imitation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and through copying.</v>

79
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>You can only imagine a co two to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

80
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>a tradition like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to sort of say this culture at,</v>

81
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

82
00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you imitate something that's</v>

83
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>actually taboo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

84
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>they get it intellectually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can tell them,</v>

85
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>but very foundationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not who they are.</v>

86
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>these are not ideas that they have had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like telling us like every</v>

88
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>time you pick up a spoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that that's when it's</v>

89
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.770
<v Speaker 1>copyrighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

90
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really should pay a little fee every</v>

91
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:40.670
<v Speaker 1>time you use that spoon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would just think that will be,</v>

92
00:03:40.671 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>that is really very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

93
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that,</v>

94
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>

95
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>we look at these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see a very big foundational split,</v>

96
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two cultures.</v>

97
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

98
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

99
00:03:53.711 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>copying is only one of the many areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you see,</v>

100
00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very divergent ideas.</v>
