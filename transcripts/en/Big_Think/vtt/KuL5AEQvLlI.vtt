1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 2>I haven't made any public comment on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not going to start on this show.</v>

3
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.960
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has a timeline of the time</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have to come to vote,</v>

4
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Speaker 2>but I think that it's likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided before then and,</v>

5
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

6
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 2>I probably will decide along with most</v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

7
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 2>I think Howard Dean was suggested at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of June,</v>

8
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>if I'm not mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm from Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I represented main in the Senate,</v>

10
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'm now a resident of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Primarily I,</v>

11
00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 2>when I left the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remarried.</v>

12
00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 2>I had young children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My children go to school here.</v>

13
00:00:57.251 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 2>So you sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you end up,</v>

14
00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a voting taxpaying citizen.</v>

15
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.560
<v Speaker 2>when Obama won the main caucus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got a bunch of letters and calls from</v>

17
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 2>people because they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought I'd be a,</v>

18
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.960
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a superdelegate for me and I've been a</v>

19
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 2>sub delegate from Maine since I left the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Senate.</v>

20
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.583
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>

22
00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama won in Maine,</v>

23
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 2>so you should vote for Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then a Clinton won in New York.</v>

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 2>and I got a few calls from Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people saying,</v>

26
00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live in New York,</v>

27
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>you ought to vote for Clinton because</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wanted New York.</v>

28
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>And then the Democratic National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Committee announced,</v>

29
00:01:39.041 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

30
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I would be a adult soup delegate from</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York.</v>

31
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:46.420
<v Speaker 2>So then I started getting calls from my</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama friends making a completely</v>

32
00:01:46.421 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 2>different argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And both sides argument have shifted</v>

33
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 2>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 2>if you say a d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you,</v>

35
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:58.390
<v Speaker 2>should I vote in accordance with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>majority in the state?</v>

36
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>That's New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I would vote for Clinton.</v>

37
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.540
<v Speaker 2>Should I vote for the majority in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>congressional district?</v>

38
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Should I vote for who wins the popular</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote nationwide?</v>

39
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Should that popular vote include or</v>
<v Speaker 2>exclude Florida,</v>

40
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 2>which is likely to be a determining</v>
<v Speaker 2>factor?</v>

41
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 2>Who Wins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

42
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.610
<v Speaker 2>each of these has an argument in and of</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

43
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 2>but I guess my feeling is I feel much</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I did in the Senate when I had to</v>

44
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 2>advise a consent on presidential</v>
<v Speaker 2>nominations.</v>

45
00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 2>The constitution doesn't define what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

46
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>So I think I should use my best judgment</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking into account and give,</v>

47
00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.760
<v Speaker 2>given great weight to the way others</v>
<v Speaker 2>have voted.</v>

48
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 2>And there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I just mentioned,</v>

49
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 2>numerous iterations of that you can look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at one of several factors,</v>

50
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.640
<v Speaker 2>including the number of delegates they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

51
00:02:45.641 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 2>one through the elective process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the end,</v>

52
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:52.921
<v Speaker 2>making a judgment which my conscience</v>
<v Speaker 2>and judgment tells me is the person who</v>

53
00:02:52.931 --> 00:02:57.280
<v Speaker 2>will best serve the nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a Democrat who will be most</v>

54
00:02:57.281 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 2>likely to be elected.</v>

55
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I did,</v>

56
00:03:05.141 --> 00:03:08.960
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't tell you because that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that defeat the purpose of any</v>

57
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.640
<v Speaker 2>mediation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

58
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't.</v>

59
00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not giving any secrets from you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

60
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.070
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it's likely to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

61
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I think it's all going to work out</v>
<v Speaker 2>before then.</v>

62
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 2>I know you're not a reporter in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strictest sense,</v>

63
00:03:22.721 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press has an interest in</v>

64
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.570
<v Speaker 2>controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keeping it going and devising scenarios</v>

65
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:36.871
<v Speaker 2>that suggest a conflict right down to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last minute of the last hour of the</v>

66
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 2>last roll call at the convention and</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe beyond.</v>

67
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 2>But I think reality is to the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it is likely to be resolved to</v>

68
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>not too long after the last primary or</v>
<v Speaker 2>caucus.</v>

69
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 2>That's not very far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've waited this long.</v>

70
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:55.210
<v Speaker 2>We can wait another week.</v>
