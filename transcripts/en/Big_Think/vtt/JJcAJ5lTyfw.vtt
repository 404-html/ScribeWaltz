1
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins is very good at,</v>

2
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 1>at framing science for his audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as an in writing popular science book</v>

3
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>books for a worldwide audience of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who already have a strong interest in</v>

4
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been a great translator.</v>

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>He's discovered the metaphors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's discovered.</v>

6
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories,</v>

7
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.680
<v Speaker 1>the examples that really unlock</v>
<v Speaker 1>complexity for his popular science</v>

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>audience get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets them to understand better the</v>

9
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>complexity of evolutionary science when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's now moved into being an atheist</v>

10
00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very good.</v>

11
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>And the God delusion at writing for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience of atheists,</v>

12
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>people already critical religion or</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are questioning and what he</v>

13
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>does a much like bill o'reilly might do</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the O'reilly factor,</v>

14
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>he provides talking points and</v>
<v Speaker 1>simplifies the arguments against</v>

15
00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>and connecting how science might be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a way to argue against religion.</v>

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.980
<v Speaker 1>And people come away from that book with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their preexisting opinions intensified</v>

18
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>and also with a lot of talking points to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express their opinion.</v>

19
00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

20
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>he's a social movement leader now he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobilized,</v>

21
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>he's intensified a movement that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical of religion.</v>

22
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>But when you move then from his natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience out into kind of the swing</v>

23
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:30.281
<v Speaker 1>public people who appreciate science but</v>
<v Speaker 1>also all maybe moderate real religious,</v>

24
00:01:30.621 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>they attend church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have friends and family who are</v>

25
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They probably lack the motivation and</v>

26
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>the interest to actually buy his book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they do see Time magazine covers</v>

27
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>that say science versus God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they might catch a snippet of one of</v>

28
00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>the soundbites where he compares</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion to child abuse or religion to</v>

29
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>fairies are hobgoblins and he becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the bay.</v>

30
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.680
<v Speaker 1>They're very leading example for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian fundamentalist to say,</v>

31
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we've told you about science</v>

32
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>and religion being conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's Richard Dawkins is leading</v>

33
00:02:03.141 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>theorists about evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saying exactly what we've told you is</v>

34
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>always been always been true is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting evolution in schools is really a</v>

35
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 1>way to undermine religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Dawkins actually says,</v>

36
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:16.040
<v Speaker 1>if you learn about evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably going to be less</v>

37
00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>religious or evolutionary sciences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>direct conflict with religion.</v>

38
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.350
<v Speaker 1>and so in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>he can be a polarizing figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 1>he could actually be used by the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>side to undermine the teaching evolution</v>

42
00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>in schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the United States.</v>

43
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>The strongest objections are from what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it,</v>

44
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>the Richard Dawkins School of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communication.</v>

45
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these people are out there in</v>

46
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 1>the blogosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They feel very intensely about the</v>

47
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>connection between science and religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>they take the viewpoint that a science</v>
<v Speaker 1>undermines the validity of any religious</v>

49
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.244
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>in fact even respect for religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their,</v>

51
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>their reaction is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>to say that science and religion are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conflict,</v>

53
00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

54
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>to present evolutionary science in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way other than just talking about the</v>

55
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>facts of the science is not being true</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the science.</v>

56
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It's been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dishonest.</v>

57
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

58
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called at Neville Chamberlain Atheist</v>

59
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm an appeaser of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

61
00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>an appeaser and an enabler of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really believe in a religion or in God.</v>

63
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

64
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>other scientists have the concern that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might just translate into spin.</v>

65
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that a science</v>

66
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>institutions should always be careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

67
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we always insist when</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about climate change,</v>

68
00:03:34.121 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>when talking about evolutionary science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you package that information in a</v>

69
00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:40.540
<v Speaker 1>way that connects to a non traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

70
00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>a non science audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have to remain true to the</v>

71
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>science and in stem cell research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great example.</v>

72
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>In some cases where the reframing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that issue around social progress,</v>

73
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>the ability to lead to cures and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapies has gone beyond the state of</v>

74
00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The uncertainty with therapies can be</v>

75
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>available.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes this has been promoted by</v>

76
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>politicians such as John Edwards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who in 2004 said if John Kerry is</v>

77
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>elected president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was campaigning for Carrie,</v>

78
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:08.270
<v Speaker 1>for vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Reeve would get up out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>wheelchair and walk again.</v>

80
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Of course this goes well beyond any type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of timeline therapy we might have</v>

81
00:04:14.981 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>available in the foreseeable future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's an example where you can go</v>

82
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 1>beyond the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>

83
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>you risk public trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you always have to be careful.</v>

84
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>But certainly no one would ever suggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Eo Wilson and writing the creation,</v>

85
00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>growing the audience for science by</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting it to,</v>

86
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious values or the national</v>

87
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 1>academies and doing audience research as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to communicate evolution.</v>

88
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>No one ever suggest that Eo Wilson of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Academies are spinning the</v>

89
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're being untruthful about the</v>

90
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:43.624
<v Speaker 1>science</v>

91
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
