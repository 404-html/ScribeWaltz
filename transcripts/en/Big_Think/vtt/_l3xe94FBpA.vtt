00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do still feel that a great collection</v>

2
00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>is not based necessarily on value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>if I was putting together an American</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial design collection,</v>

4
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>which I've kind of dabbled with over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

5
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:26.171
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely possible to put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>artifacts,</v>

6
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a meat slicer by Egmont</v>
<v Speaker 1>errands or an outboard motor or a</v>

7
00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>cocktail shaker that you can acquire on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ebay.</v>

8
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:42.071
<v Speaker 1>You can acquire at the low budget kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of swap meet shows like the triple pier</v>

9
00:00:42.561 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>show here in Manhattan where you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only spend a few hundred dollars</v>

10
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>for some of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's how selective you are.</v>

11
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>collections.</v>

12
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>There's collections that take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>curatorial eye and really just focused</v>

13
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>on a certain theme and develop that</v>
<v Speaker 1>theme and every piece juxtaposes with</v>

14
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's the great obsessives,</v>

15
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.830
<v Speaker 1>the the people that have to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything by that designer and maybe</v>

16
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>those collectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best of that group are the ones who</v>

17
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>as years go by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not afraid to refine that collection</v>

18
00:01:16.611 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>and sell off certain stuff that isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite holding the test of time.</v>

19
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>So I identify with both the obsessive</v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsive collecting community and the</v>

20
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 1>minimalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to Imitate v try and create a</v>

21
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>perfect chair collection.</v>
