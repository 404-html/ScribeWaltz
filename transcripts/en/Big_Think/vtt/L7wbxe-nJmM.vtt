1
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Capitalism is based on a set of rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice theory.</v>

2
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Rational choice theory is I'm mathematic</v>
<v Speaker 1>formulation that has demonstrably</v>

3
00:00:17.631 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>benefits in terms of avoiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>simple errors in judgment and decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's undergoing some revision because</v>

6
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>some of the biases and errors that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>make,</v>

7
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be understood and improve those</v>

8
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:36.590
<v Speaker 1>formulas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are two assumptions underlying</v>

9
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>rational choice that are assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not part of the mathematics,</v>

10
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>they're assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because short term interests and the</v>

12
00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>other is selfish interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do what's good for you.</v>

13
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>And it's as society becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>

14
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>as scientific inquiry becomes more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex,</v>

15
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.060
<v Speaker 1>has daily living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he comes more complex,</v>

16
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coordinating our efforts together</v>

17
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.510
<v Speaker 1>working so that we can trust one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized,</v>

19
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I can count on you to do a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll do b and together a and b are</v>

20
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>more than the sum of the parts.</v>

21
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of problem solving which</v>

22
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:24.161
<v Speaker 1>suggest selfish interests is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumption that may have outlived its</v>

23
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>usefulness that it's not about being</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure alteras.</v>

24
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about coming up with something</v>

25
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>where you relate to other people in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion where everybody benefits more,</v>

26
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>where the sum is greater than the total</v>
<v Speaker 1>is greater than the sum of the parts.</v>

27
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>that's just an assumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we put that assumption in the</v>

29
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>rational choice theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden capitalism looks a</v>

30
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look for sustainability,</v>

31
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.641
<v Speaker 1>we look for things that are good for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community as well as for the company.</v>

32
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see such efforts,</v>

33
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest airline is just one airline</v>

34
00:02:01.311 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>that was built,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>caring as much about their employees as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the customers.</v>

36
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:06.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest has been,</v>

38
00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of a business success stories.</v>

39
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Some of the Asian companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>similarly constructed around a concern</v>

40
00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:19.150
<v Speaker 1>for the community and the employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the stockholders.</v>

41
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>And that is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to serve stockholders,</v>

42
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>but they want to serve beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>stockholders and a,</v>

43
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>those are again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the real success stories.</v>

44
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>So I think we're seeing precedents set</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

45
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 1>and it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a denial of rational choice</v>

46
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really just a questioning of one of</v>

47
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 1>the assumptions underlying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's,</v>

48
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 1>there's good reason to pursue what</v>
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>

49
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>what might be done with capitalism with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that assumption.</v>

50
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.173
<v Speaker 1>A change.</v>

51
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 2>CHICAGO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with</v>

52
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 1>some economists sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we look at are</v>

53
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>the errors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People making judgment.</v>

54
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

55
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>35 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economists never assume did rational</v>

56
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.721
<v Speaker 1>choice that people were rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They assume that irrationality was so</v>

57
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>irrational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to be random.</v>

58
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>And economics isn't about predicting an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual behavior.</v>

59
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>That's the domain of psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economics is about predicting aggregate</v>

60
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 1>if I have complete irrationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's random,</v>

62
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.990
<v Speaker 1>that's just like noise and I average</v>
<v Speaker 1>over many such random noise.</v>

63
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>That sums does zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're left with just rationality.</v>

64
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what the last 30 years of</v>

65
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>research and particularly current</v>
<v Speaker 1>research and behavioral economics and in</v>

66
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>neuroeconomics this showing us that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrationality of systematic,</v>

67
00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not always random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were systematic biases that we</v>

68
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the biases that that people show</v>

69
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.521
<v Speaker 1>is if they want to not come to be true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they overestimate the odds versus if</v>

70
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>they don't want the outcome to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's it's bias that once you</v>

71
00:03:58.001 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>realize you can tweak the mathematics</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so that it's more [inaudible]</v>

72
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.880
<v Speaker 2>presented about how humans actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>think can be age.</v>

73
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 2>I think our research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sean,</v>

74
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 2>what's fundamentally all about</v>

75
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>human nature has implications for how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>live our lives now.</v>

76
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Businesses conduct research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>there is a sense in which bringing these</v>
<v Speaker 1>teams together with different expertise</v>

78
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>gives you the opportunity to attack</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

79
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>come up with more creative solutions</v>
<v Speaker 1>than not because of the complexity you</v>

80
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>need those different levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise,</v>

81
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but it bringing people together isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient.</v>

82
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming loneliness isn't about just</v>

83
00:04:45.761 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 1>connecting with another person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's connecting at a deep level.</v>

84
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>That's reinforcing for both individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Businesses if they understand that</v>

85
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:58.150
<v Speaker 1>principle can understand that bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts together isn't sufficient.</v>

86
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>It's bringing the experts together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing them or promoting their</v>

87
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>connection so that it's beyond what</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you normally would get.</v>

88
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to give you an example in the</v>

89
00:05:08.621 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>research domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.230
<v Speaker 1>I've been a member of research teams</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we would fly into a vicinity.</v>

91
00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.011
<v Speaker 1>We meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet,</v>

92
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>meet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I flew to Bergen,</v>

93
00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a long flight.</v>

94
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>We met in some hotel meeting room for</v>
<v Speaker 1>two days and then flew home.</v>

95
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea what Norway looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the most miserable</v>

96
00:05:27.131 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just jet lag.</v>

97
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>That's all it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure we got something from the</v>

98
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not very much.</v>

99
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other meetings.</v>

100
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

101
00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>I run a large interdisciplinary team of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>

102
00:05:38.891 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>wonderful colleagues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The research in the book is really</v>

103
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:46.270
<v Speaker 1>representing the work of many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific disciplines and expertise.</v>

104
00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we,</v>

105
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>when we come together to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we meet off campus first of all and we</v>

106
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>meet off campus because when we're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus,</v>

107
00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>we're busy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:05:55.121 --> 00:06:00.050
<v Speaker 1>we all have things going on and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to disconnect our minds from</v>

109
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>our students and our colleagues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other demands when we go off campus.</v>

110
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.610
<v Speaker 1>We also bring family with us and we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings only for about six hours a day</v>

111
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>and we have formal gatherings as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

112
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>We eat together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we break bread together,</v>

113
00:06:15.171 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>we'd go on outings together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go for walks together in various sub</v>

114
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>pairings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that allows you to do is rather</v>

115
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>than saying this is what I know and</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting,</v>

116
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>that you start to like these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to understand and want to want</v>

117
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>to understand more about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

118
00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 1>And so rather than relying just on what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all already agree so we can get outta</v>

119
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

120
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:38.391
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

121
00:06:38.391 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that's what we all think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the common knowledge and we</v>

122
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>all had that's not actually taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the expertise that unique.</v>

123
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>And really the reason we're all here is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the unique knowledge,</v>

124
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.190
<v Speaker 1>not the common knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That takes longer and that unique</v>

125
00:06:52.191 --> 00:06:55.280
<v Speaker 1>knowledge starts to come out on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>walks and it starts to come out in the</v>

126
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:59.270
<v Speaker 1>meetings after you've done those walks</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not about coming to a quick</v>

127
00:06:59.271 --> 00:06:59.690
<v Speaker 1>solution.</v>

128
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.720
<v Speaker 1>It's about coming to a playful that</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

129
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>well tell me what you might know and why</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you think that.</v>

130
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not attacking you in that.</v>

131
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually curious in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden the language</v>

132
00:07:09.921 --> 00:07:14.060
<v Speaker 1>differences and the disciplinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences are easier to bridge.</v>

133
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that in that lesson in science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lesson for businesses as well</v>

134
00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>to bring together expertise and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise may be different,</v>

135
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the product line or it may be</v>

136
00:07:25.731 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>labor versus management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different interests,</v>

137
00:07:28.401 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>expertise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does one transcend and really do</v>

138
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>something that's better for everybody in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longterm?</v>

139
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Because that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I think the secret of our,</v>

140
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 1>our species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very good at coming up with those</v>

141
00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.330
<v Speaker 1>new kind of social kind of construct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the emperor penguin,</v>

142
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:48.100
<v Speaker 1>they require huddles to get through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>winter there.</v>

143
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I think they get together in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective and without that collective,</v>

144
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>none of them would survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

145
00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>That's the vehicle for genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission is this group that's bigger</v>

146
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:02.480
<v Speaker 1>than the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only collective unit.</v>

147
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Humans have many such collectors and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can create them and recreate them on a</v>

148
00:08:07.191 --> 00:08:10.460
<v Speaker 1>moment by moment basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the real talent and capacity</v>

149
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>comes from how do we configure those so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're productive.</v>

150
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:19.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
