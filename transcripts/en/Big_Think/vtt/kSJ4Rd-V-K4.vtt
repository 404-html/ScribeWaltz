00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm a TV junkie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I like pictures.</v>

2
00:00:02.701 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>I like images and radio doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3
00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might initially seem weird,</v>

4
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of ultimately the coolest</v>

5
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>thing about radio is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what it lacks is somehow empowered by</v>

6
00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the absence of pictures.</v>

7
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:21.411
<v Speaker 1>Because what that enables is the simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>act like I could describe something to</v>

8
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:23.634
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when I walked up the stairs to come</v>

10
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>into the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:32.871
<v Speaker 1>the sun was out in the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had this weird kind of pg white,</v>

12
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>whew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of like the color of a</v>

13
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his belly or something.</v>

14
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>Like you may be just imagine something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well think of what,</v>

16
00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>just what just happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

17
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>in a sense I'm painting something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not holding the paintbrush.</v>

18
00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>so it's this deep act of coauthor ship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that is some potential for</v>

20
00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>empathy.</v>

21
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it's somehow we're doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>together because we have to fill this</v>

22
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>gap of picture listeners together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to somehow be connected.</v>

23
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I love that about radio as much as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>

24
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched so much tv,</v>

25
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of shocking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I love the,</v>

26
00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>the immediacy and the connection that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have with another person through</v>

27
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>radio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it has something to do with</v>

28
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>this co imagining that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

29
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>if I do my job right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

30
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.840
<v Speaker 1>if I can put certain images and feelings</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your head,</v>

31
00:01:27.841 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>then I know we can connect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do to it.</v>

32
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter what you want,</v>

33
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>new techniques you inject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>the power of this medium is rooted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human voice and the human voice has</v>

35
00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>so much information in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vibrations of the voice,</v>

36
00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>the way the voice rises and falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the musicality of the human voice is,</v>

37
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the engine of everything that we do.</v>

38
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps that's why radio never dies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to have died about 50</v>

39
00:01:56.851 --> 00:01:59.760
<v Speaker 1>times right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure it'll be declared dead 50</v>

40
00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>more times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something that happens when</v>

41
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>you turn on the radio and someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you and they're talking to</v>

42
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>just you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

43
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an immediacy and a,</v>

44
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an intimacy that can happen that,</v>

45
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of feel inoculates this,</v>

46
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>this technology from ever dying</v>
<v Speaker 1>least.</v>

47
00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my bet.</v>

48
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Professionally speaking.</v>
