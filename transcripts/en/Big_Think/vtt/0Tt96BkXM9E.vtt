1
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:14.421
<v Speaker 1>I think the obstacles are the same as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunities.</v>

2
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:15.254
<v Speaker 1>It's the way we like to look at them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have this really powerful </v>

3
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:19.454
<v Speaker 1>technological infrastructure that can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tremendous things at the same </v>

4
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:23.294
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to be as flexible as </v>

5
00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>we'd like it to be just by nature of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

6
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>of web technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can deliver news across the globe in </v>

8
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:34.904
<v Speaker 1>a matter of seconds or minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty amazing and we can </v>

9
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:40.244
<v Speaker 1>create a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really fascinating tools for our users </v>

10
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>to take advantage of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>those technologies don't allow us to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.093
<v Speaker 1>tool retool a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the appearance or the presentation of </v>

15
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>every piece of content in exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that we would like.</v>

16
00:01:01.611 --> 00:01:02.444
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real inherent limitations to </v>

17
00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 1>the tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

18
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's two sides of the same coin.</v>

20
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.773
<v Speaker 1>we often get reader feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both positive and negative no matter </v>

22
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>what we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me think.</v>

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are times when,</v>

25
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are really obvious to us,</v>

26
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've really tried to design them in</v>

27
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.564
<v Speaker 1>such a way that we think will be obvious</v>
<v Speaker 1>to readers who and users who have only </v>

28
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>casual familiarity with the site and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get feedback that,</v>

29
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>they have no idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

31
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>what we intended was actually the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>and I'm trying to think of an example </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the top of my head right now.</v>

34
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.593
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll occasionally add sort of </v>

36
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:05.844
<v Speaker 1>alternative views to the homepage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new experimental presentations of our </v>

37
00:02:09.661 --> 00:02:14.661
<v Speaker 1>top content features like times wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had one called times extra.</v>

38
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.420
<v Speaker 1>We have a social networking layer called</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.170
<v Speaker 1>called times people.</v>

40
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are things that we spent a lot</v>

41
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>of time trying to make as intuitive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to use as possible.</v>

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes,</v>

43
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

44
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>we hit the mark and a lot of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>people will ask us,</v>

45
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.203
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this thing do that you have </v>

46
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have really no idea,</v>

47
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:36.744
<v Speaker 1>no understanding of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just sort of blows us out of </v>

48
00:02:38.551 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>the water that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can be.</v>

49
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.713
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we've designed can be so as </v>

51
00:02:45.511 --> 00:02:46.344
<v Speaker 1>unintuitive as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the reader might be interpreting it </v>

52
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 1>as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's always a,</v>

53
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:54.743
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think one of the hardest and </v>

54
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>most and most illuminating parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>job is really,</v>

55
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 1>really constantly reminding yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>that what's obvious to you is not </v>

56
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>obvious to the users.</v>

57
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you about a big project that </v>

58
00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:15.290
<v Speaker 1>we finished up late last year for we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a,</v>

59
00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.033
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a luxury magazine that comes into with </v>

60
00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:21.950
<v Speaker 1>the Sunday paper called t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and that covers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.390
<v Speaker 1>men's fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's fashion design,</v>

63
00:03:29.391 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living that,</v>

64
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:32.360
<v Speaker 1>that sort of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really high end luxury.</v>

65
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And we had a site that we launched in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2007,</v>

66
00:03:38.031 --> 00:03:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we felt pretty,</v>

68
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:41.603
<v Speaker 1>pretty good about it at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it quickly became apparent that it </v>

69
00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:46.424
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was too expensive to produce and </v>

70
00:03:47.241 --> 00:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really yielding the results that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we were looking for.</v>

71
00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:55.271
<v Speaker 1>So we worked most of last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2009 really overhauling that sites.</v>

72
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moving it away from what had been a </v>

73
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:05.561
<v Speaker 1>presentation that was really centered </v>
<v Speaker 1>around what appeared in print to a brand</v>

74
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:12.251
<v Speaker 1>new kind of user experience that really </v>
<v Speaker 1>emphasize what we saw,</v>

75
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.460
<v Speaker 1>how we saw users interacting with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

76
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.293
<v Speaker 1>So instead of showing all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>photography and the photo spreads and </v>

77
00:04:23.361 --> 00:04:28.361
<v Speaker 1>the feature stories as the sole main </v>
<v Speaker 1>gateway to that site,</v>

78
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>we've moved to a new kind of experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the content is,</v>

79
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:37.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm a bit more atomized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of access it from many </v>

80
00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:40.643
<v Speaker 1>different many different ways and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>really emphasizing the blog and have </v>

81
00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.521
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:46.521 --> 00:04:47.840
<v Speaker 1>the site as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the major access point because what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw was that users responded best to our</v>

84
00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:55.034
<v Speaker 1>blog even though it was not the major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main access point that they </v>

85
00:04:58.401 --> 00:05:02.630
<v Speaker 1>responded to its timeliness and its,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the brevity of the content.</v>

86
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.813
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we completely reoriented the </v>

87
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 1>sites around that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

88
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>and that was something I really pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>for 'em hard in,</v>

89
00:05:10.261 --> 00:05:12.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in late 2008,</v>

90
00:05:12.051 --> 00:05:12.884
<v Speaker 1>early 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were able to launch it late last </v>

91
00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:15.493
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
