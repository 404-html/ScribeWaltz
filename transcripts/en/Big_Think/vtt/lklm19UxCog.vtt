1
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in the fringes of the oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>business in Tulsa,</v>

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Tulsa called itself the oil capital of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in the 19 fifties and it</v>

3
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>wasn't real far off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very central to a lot of oil</v>

4
00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil equipment,</v>

5
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and the rest and most people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

6
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>a very large share of them were in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil business in one way or another.</v>

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so anybody who's familiar with the oil</v>

8
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:30.111
<v Speaker 1>business knows that up until the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century you could only get gasoline</v>

9
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>from a tiny share of petroleum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first with thermal cracking and then</v>

10
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>in the thirties catalytic cracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could use much larger share,</v>

11
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent maybe of oil to produce</v>

12
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was that expansion of the</v>

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.230
<v Speaker 1>feedstock that made possible the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transportation Revolution of the early</v>

14
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a reason,</v>

15
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>gasoline was twenty five cents a gallon</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was growing up in Tulsa.</v>

16
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.410
<v Speaker 1>Detroit doesn't produce the oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the United States produces some oil</v>

17
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to need oil for a long</v>

18
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we can get to a lot less oil than</v>

19
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>we have now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do something very important.</v>

20
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you one example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any corn of the Igs,</v>

21
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:21.720
<v Speaker 1>a think tank in in Washington that</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotes</v>

22
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>working on energy for national security</v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes says that um,</v>

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 1>up until the late 19th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century salt was a strategic</v>

24
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no other way to preserve meat.</v>

25
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Preserving meat was hugely important for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human diet,</v>

26
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>huge share of the human food chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people who had salt mines and</v>

27
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>countries that had salt mines were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important.</v>

28
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries fought wars over salt.</v>

29
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.930
<v Speaker 1>That changed with refrigeration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we still use salt.</v>

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Probably we still use it some to</v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve meat,</v>

31
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but mainly we use it for flavoring and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing or another,</v>

32
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>unless you are intimately familiar with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morton's,</v>

33
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't have any idea where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes from.</v>

34
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>You don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bought and sold on a market.</v>

35
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a commodity like a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodities,</v>

36
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>but nobody is going to order you around</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's got salt and you don't,</v>

37
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to do that oil,</v>

38
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>we need to destroy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not oil,</v>

39
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 1>but we need to destroy it as a strategic</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodity so we don't need it for</v>

40
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are real competitors and the</v>

41
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>competitors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>

42
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>alternative fuels together in one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some combination,</v>

43
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get the job done at that point.</v>

44
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Oil becomes like lots of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodities and by the way,</v>

45
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>it becomes much more operative in a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>market because what you have now is not</v>

46
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>a free market.</v>

47
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.610
<v Speaker 1>OPEC runs at a cartel and they are able</v>
<v Speaker 1>run it with Saudi Arabia leading it a</v>

48
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>because it's a strategic commodity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no other way for most people</v>

49
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>and most structures in the world to</v>
<v Speaker 1>propel their vehicles around except</v>

50
00:03:12.971 --> 00:03:14.630
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the oil,</v>

51
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>petroleum derived fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can end that.</v>

52
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>So there are some competitors that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to oils cost like cellulosic</v>

53
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:26.660
<v Speaker 1>ethanol and others like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are much cheaper.</v>

55
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>People are still gonna want oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how cheap it is.</v>

56
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Whether they use oil or natural gas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemical plant,</v>

57
00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>etc. Fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to destroy oil.</v>

58
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Want to do to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What reFrigeration did assault.</v>
