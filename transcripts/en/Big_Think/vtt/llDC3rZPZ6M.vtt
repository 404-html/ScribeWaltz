00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York is a lot less dangerous now,</v>

2
00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.910
<v Speaker 1>or I perceive it as less dangerous than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be.</v>

3
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's</v>

4
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 2>gotten a lot harder for people to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>here and start here.</v>

5
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.831
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7
00:00:23.831 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 2>people are always talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>demise of New York,</v>

8
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 2>whether it was rotting in the 70s when I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was growing up,</v>

9
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 2>or now that it's filled with hedge fund</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and artists can't afford it.</v>

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 2>So I think that New York being in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process of failing in some way is a big</v>

11
00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:40.510
<v Speaker 2>part of the city's narrative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's good to know that it's still</v>

12
00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:42.340
<v Speaker 2>going on just in a completely different</v>
<v Speaker 2>format.</v>
