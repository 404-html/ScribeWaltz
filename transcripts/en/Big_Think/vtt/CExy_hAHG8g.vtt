1
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm Peter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm founder and CEO of line too.</v>

2
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 1>That's a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the first thing is don't quit</v>

3
00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>your day job until you've done real</v>
<v Speaker 1>diligence on the idea.</v>

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really look at the market,</v>

5
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>look at where the market is headed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the trends,</v>

6
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>look at the competitive landscape and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to play a few strategic moves</v>

7
00:00:31.221 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>into the future to see is this something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ultimately going to be dominated</v>

8
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>by x big company or why big company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not always a reason to say no,</v>

9
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly something you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at.</v>

10
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>and then make sure you have a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>model and you know,</v>

12
00:00:47.151 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>how you're gonna make money and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 1>bounce it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few smart people,</v>

14
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:52.920
<v Speaker 1>but not too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>people you really trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll be honest with you.</v>

16
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And if it passes all of those tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you should ignore everyone else</v>

17
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:06.761
<v Speaker 1>that tells you it's a bad idea because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will hear endlessly from people that</v>

18
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>are naysayers or don't understand it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't researched as well as you have</v>

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who will say,</v>

20
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not possible.</v>

21
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>And here's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm part of being an entrepreneur is</v>

22
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 1>that as long as you've done that initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>diligence and you've convinced a few</v>

23
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:26.030
<v Speaker 1>smart people and you all agree that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an opportunity,</v>

24
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>then you've got to just believe that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very end and,</v>

25
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>because you will get a lot of days where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to second guess yourself and</v>

27
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:36.524
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>people are telling you that is not a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good idea.</v>

29
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>Now I'll qualify that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the key to startup success and why they</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeed,</v>

31
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>where big companies don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that they can turn on a dime and the</v>

32
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>whole process of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take you through how we started</v>

33
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 1>lying to slash talk to me.</v>

34
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>But the whole process is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>it's really about test and measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test and measure in a sense.</v>

36
00:02:04.491 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

37
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.540
<v Speaker 1>we all hear about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>there's the facebooks of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the googles and they're these</v>

39
00:02:12.171 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>massive home runs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everyone sort of thinks that,</v>

40
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just put up a website and if I get</v>

41
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.570
<v Speaker 1>lucky and do the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take off,</v>

42
00:02:20.571 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>but very few businesses are created that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and that's,</v>

43
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

44
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like in the movie business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's only you can count the major</v>

45
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>stars on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

46
00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.400
<v Speaker 1>on two hands and everybody else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>working their ass off.</v>

47
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>And not that they don't work either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a little easier for him maybe.</v>

48
00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the trick is you don't have to</v>

49
00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:43.910
<v Speaker 1>risk a lot of capital upfront to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

50
00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>So the way we do it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have to get it right,</v>

51
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>but you get it out.</v>

52
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.490
<v Speaker 1>There is the trick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get something out there.</v>

53
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.020
<v Speaker 1>If you sit and stew and try to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and nothing ever gets out there,</v>

54
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>you can be too cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the trick is get it out there and</v>

55
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>then iterate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get feedback from customers.</v>

56
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we've been doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got the first version of our product</v>

57
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>out in February of 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

58
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did,</v>

59
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 1>didn't do much to promote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

60
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>we got 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 Beta customers and then we iterated</v>

61
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>on what they were telling us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they like about it,</v>

62
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>what didn't they like about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what features are missing,</v>

63
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>what do they want to see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we iterated for nine months until we</v>

64
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>were comfortable to actually start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put marketing money behind it.</v>

65
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot of learning that,</v>

66
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

67
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 1>that is you have to be receptive to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

68
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

69
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>it isn't really sort of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>put it out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build the field,</v>

71
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 1>and they will come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really has a whole other aspect</v>

72
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>too is once you've got the product</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

73
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>the real challenge is attracting</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers to it.</v>

74
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 1>It can be a fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely great product,</v>

75
00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.910
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't get the word out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire customers cost effectively so</v>

76
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that you have a business model and can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make money.</v>

77
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter how nice a product it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

78
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I have always wanted to start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

79
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I've always felt that a running my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>company was really the best place for</v>

80
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best home for me for a lot of</v>

81
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:19.290
<v Speaker 1>reasons which we can go into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically I'd look at different</v>

83
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and see what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could pan out and the trick is to be</v>

85
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>very hard on yourself when you're first</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of an idea and talk to smart</v>

86
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>people to make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 1>you kind of vet it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>and then the first one was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>typically you want to solve a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

90
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>And the problem I had was that I liked</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine,</v>

91
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but I would go into a wine store and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had no idea which one was good in which</v>

92
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:52.450
<v Speaker 1>was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still a problem today.</v>

93
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>So you could rewind spectator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

94
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>magazines to learn about wine.</v>

96
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you could never find the wines</v>

97
00:05:00.431 --> 00:05:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that they were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a mismatch between the</v>

98
00:05:03.851 --> 00:05:08.851
<v Speaker 1>ability to learn about a wine and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>act on that information to make a</v>

99
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:12.280
<v Speaker 1>purchase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Wine Shopper was my first company,</v>

100
00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 1>which was a site that combined the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to buy wine with the,</v>

101
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

102
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including ratings from wine spectator</v>

103
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>and wine enthusiast and other agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviews community and all of this.</v>

104
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And this was 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bubble company.</v>

105
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was funded by Kleiner Perkins and</v>

106
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:36.901
<v Speaker 1>Amazon Dot com raise $46,000,000 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>built a 200 employee company very</v>

107
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

108
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

109
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>learned some painful lessons in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to capital and how quickly that</v>

110
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 1>can dry up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:05:50.081 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>the company was ultimately acquired by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitor,</v>

112
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

113
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 1>but that competitor did not survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that my first sort of big venture</v>

114
00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>kind of deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good experience,</v>

115
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:04.670
<v Speaker 1>lots of learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody made any money on x one</v>

116
00:06:04.671 --> 00:06:07.090
<v Speaker 1>called Masonic was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

118
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty upset for a little while</v>

119
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've just got to pick yourself up and</v>

121
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>dust yourself off.</v>

122
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's entrepreneurship is really</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sales and that,</v>

123
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.033
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can,</v>

124
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:27.100
<v Speaker 1>you get a lot of discouragement along</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way and you have to be really strong</v>

125
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 1>and just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just got right back up on the</v>

126
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:32.610
<v Speaker 1>horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started a company called [inaudible],</v>

127
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>which is now profitable and growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicely,</v>

128
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:37.010
<v Speaker 1>still private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the board,</v>

129
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 1>so that one's a wait and see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

130
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

131
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>then I started a company called Taleo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>

132
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a white label version of skype if you</v>

133
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>know what skype is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most people do by now.</v>

134
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:55.400
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was very lucky timing and was</v>

135
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:57.580
<v Speaker 1>acquired by Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>within 18 months of its being founded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

137
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to work for Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I signed a noncompete,</v>

138
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a year off and traveled and then</v>

139
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>started my latest venture line to also</v>
<v Speaker 1>known as talked to me.</v>

140
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm line to is really a,</v>

141
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.270
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

142
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 1>solution for where business is headed</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in terms of the way people work.</v>

143
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.080
<v Speaker 1>If you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

144
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.800
<v Speaker 1>landlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

145
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>more and more people are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do I need a landline?</v>

146
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.320
<v Speaker 1>And they're getting rid of them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sticking to their mobile phone</v>

147
00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:38.540
<v Speaker 1>and there's some problems with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't always work in your</v>

148
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:40.550
<v Speaker 1>home and there's battery life issues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

149
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people getting rid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>landlines,</v>

150
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 1>we believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.910
<v Speaker 1>with line two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is happening in the</v>

152
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>office environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly small businesses.</v>

153
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 1>You don't really need an office where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has to drive their car in and</v>

154
00:07:52.911 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>park in order to be productive anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have all of this technology that you</v>

155
00:07:56.781 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 1>can use the Internet and communication</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies to be productive virtually.</v>

156
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>So lying to basically a is a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>line on your mobile phone.</v>

157
00:08:08.441 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a second line so you add a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>line to your mobile phone.</v>

158
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:15.530
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's called line to that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the features ultimately that that</v>

159
00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>office phone had no transferring calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting up conferences and stuff like</v>

160
00:08:20.061 --> 00:08:20.780
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

161
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>And so we've just released it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was approved by Apple,</v>

162
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in early September.</v>

163
00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And sales have been very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of need for that</v>

164
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.280
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately the problem we're solving</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people want to work and be</v>

165
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:39.020
<v Speaker 1>productive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want or need an office</v>

166
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 1>and they don't want to be tethered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

167
00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:41.751
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't,</v>

168
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:43.730
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's using Wifi.</v>

169
00:08:43.731 --> 00:08:45.680
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not even a jack in,</v>

170
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:49.640
<v Speaker 1>into which a plug and office phone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>most office environments for new</v>

171
00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we do.</v>

172
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.800
<v Speaker 1>So long answer to your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of give you a,</v>

173
00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>of each business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always about trying to solve a</v>

174
00:08:58.891 --> 00:08:59.724
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

175
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was skeptical at first and uh,</v>

177
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I still scratch my head about twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I now uh,</v>

178
00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:11.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

180
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's here to stay,</v>

181
00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things that it's a</v>

182
00:09:16.351 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 1>self fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It became popular because it became</v>

183
00:09:18.931 --> 00:09:20.100
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to describe it,</v>

184
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.383
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

185
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:22.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at any rate,</v>

186
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

187
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>the guy that does my marketing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious about that.</v>

188
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:31.240
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of cool tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>

190
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of stuff that,</v>

191
00:09:37.010 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>

192
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>And one of them is you need to blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

193
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:45.230
<v Speaker 1>why do I need a blog?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of it is,</v>

194
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>is if you have constantly changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>content on your website,</v>

195
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:53.160
<v Speaker 1>so the blog has to be on your website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then a search engines reward that.</v>

196
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:56.650
<v Speaker 1>So like a new site or sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly changing content.</v>

197
00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>So if you put up a website and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing with it,</v>

198
00:09:58.651 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>you'll slip down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you keep changing the content and</v>

199
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>making that content relevant to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>service that you offer and the types of</v>

200
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 1>customers you're trying to attract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll start to go up and natural</v>

201
00:10:08.281 --> 00:10:10.080
<v Speaker 1>search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that you do is,</v>

202
00:10:10.081 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>and once you blog a post,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where the social media comes in,</v>

203
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 1>post a blog entry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you tweet it and you post it to</v>

204
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

205
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

206
00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.470
<v Speaker 1>and two different groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

207
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.270
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what happens is this magic</v>

208
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 1>thing happens where it just gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reverberates through the web.</v>

209
00:10:30.781 --> 00:10:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's really fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one blog post suddenly translates</v>

210
00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:40.341
<v Speaker 1>into multiple hits and those hits are</v>
<v Speaker 1>all then linking back to your blog post.</v>

211
00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And that means you're getting more links</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your website,</v>

212
00:10:43.261 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>which as you probably know in search</v>
<v Speaker 1>engine optimization,</v>

213
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 1>that's another thing that's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important is to generate links back to</v>

214
00:10:48.511 --> 00:10:50.070
<v Speaker 1>your site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

215
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of dragged kicking and</v>

216
00:10:52.321 --> 00:10:54.450
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I'm a true believer.</v>

217
00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It really does work.</v>

218
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:01.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of companies offering</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone service obviously.</v>

219
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

220
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:05.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

221
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:10.380
<v Speaker 1>our differentiation is our focus and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think this is important important lesson</v>

222
00:11:10.381 --> 00:11:12.720
<v Speaker 1>for all startups is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

223
00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.720
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of people because we only</v>

224
00:11:15.721 --> 00:11:20.721
<v Speaker 1>charged 1490 $5 a month who ask us if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can hook up a Ata,</v>

225
00:11:20.881 --> 00:11:23.640
<v Speaker 1>which is what vonage provides it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a little box that you plug your</v>

226
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.200
<v Speaker 1>phone into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One end is the internet.</v>

227
00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:27.720
<v Speaker 1>The other end is the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want an Ata.</v>

228
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.320
<v Speaker 1>But I know from looking at vonage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other companies that the biggest support</v>

229
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:38.250
<v Speaker 1>expense for those companies is that Ata,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because getting people to get under</v>

230
00:11:38.251 --> 00:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>their desks and play with their routers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hook that thing up,</v>

231
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a pain and everyone practically</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs a customer support person holding</v>

232
00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 1>their hand through the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's very expensive.</v>

233
00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're like,</v>

234
00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our customers,</v>

235
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there are customers that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drag us in that direction,</v>

236
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:01.050
<v Speaker 1>but we are razor focused on our belief</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the future is not about wired</v>

237
00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the future is about mobile and</v>

238
00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.390
<v Speaker 1>laptop calling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like skype and your mobile</v>

239
00:12:07.391 --> 00:12:09.970
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does business phone service look</v>

240
00:12:09.971 --> 00:12:14.350
<v Speaker 1>like in a world of skype and mobile</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones and that's what we're laser</v>

241
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>focused on and we're the only ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>positioned that way.</v>

242
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And by being that focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

243
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>it just makes everything better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

244
00:12:21.431 --> 00:12:25.450
<v Speaker 1>you can communicate your position to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>market in a much more laser focused way</v>

245
00:12:25.451 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 1>so that you can actually stand out as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand.</v>

246
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.480
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting question because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

247
00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:39.180
<v Speaker 1>we are increasingly getting consumers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who come to us and um,</v>

248
00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 1>so the line to app as I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

249
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.580
<v Speaker 1>particularly young people that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a landline,</v>

250
00:12:45.581 --> 00:12:46.660
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

251
00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:51.661
<v Speaker 1>why does it make sense for me to buy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone wire to a wall in particularly</v>

252
00:12:51.941 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>young people because they're moving from</v>
<v Speaker 1>dorms and apartments and many</v>

253
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:58.630
<v Speaker 1>apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just makes no sense and you can't</v>

254
00:12:58.631 --> 00:13:00.480
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 1>use it most of the time because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out and about and what have you.</v>

256
00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:05.470
<v Speaker 1>So what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

257
00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:08.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to get rid of their</v>

258
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>landline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is some can't because either</v>

259
00:13:10.721 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>they don't have cell phone reception at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

260
00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:14.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

261
00:13:14.591 --> 00:13:16.810
<v Speaker 1>they talk a lot and they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear down the battery though,</v>

262
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of reasons.</v>

263
00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.860
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

264
00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you can use line to the current version</v>
<v Speaker 1>works over cellular,</v>

265
00:13:23.651 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>but the version coming out in a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

266
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.360
<v Speaker 1>we'll work over cellular or over Wifi</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be the first dual</v>

267
00:13:31.361 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>mode thing on your iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the smartphone,</v>

268
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:35.830
<v Speaker 1>on the market.</v>

269
00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:39.540
<v Speaker 1>So in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like skype can only work over Wifi,</v>

270
00:13:39.541 --> 00:13:44.541
<v Speaker 1>it can go over broadband.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So bottom line is a,</v>

271
00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:46.420
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't go over cellular.</v>

272
00:13:46.421 --> 00:13:50.920
<v Speaker 1>Skype only works over a wide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on the iphone.</v>

273
00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.880
<v Speaker 1>So if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this now gives you way to ditch your</v>

274
00:13:55.881 --> 00:13:57.520
<v Speaker 1>landline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long answer to your question,</v>

275
00:13:57.521 --> 00:14:02.521
<v Speaker 1>but you could use a line to number as</v>
<v Speaker 1>your landline substitute.</v>

276
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.010
<v Speaker 1>You can use it over Wifi when you're at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and you don't have cell phone</v>

277
00:14:06.011 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 1>reception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use it as sort of the number you</v>

278
00:14:08.471 --> 00:14:10.800
<v Speaker 1>give out to everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the number.</v>

279
00:14:10.801 --> 00:14:12.760
<v Speaker 1>You're best friends have your cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

280
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but you know your bank people and credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>card companies statement.</v>

281
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:19.660
<v Speaker 1>You know anyone billing anyone where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they asked for your home phone number</v>

282
00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.770
<v Speaker 1>that you're doing business with or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you don't want to be</v>

283
00:14:23.771 --> 00:14:24.760
<v Speaker 1>bothered on your cell phone.</v>

284
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 1>You do that on your line to number and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have all these controls where</v>

285
00:14:28.661 --> 00:14:30.670
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let certain people through,</v>

286
00:14:30.671 --> 00:14:32.950
<v Speaker 1>depending on the time of day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they are,</v>

287
00:14:32.951 --> 00:14:34.630
<v Speaker 1>whether they're friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether business,</v>

288
00:14:34.631 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>different greetings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on who they are.</v>

289
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do all this stuff to sort of</v>

290
00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.180
<v Speaker 1>make it a much more of a tool rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a nuisance.</v>

291
00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Which I think Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my landline phone at home,</v>

292
00:14:45.611 --> 00:14:47.350
<v Speaker 1>I never answered anymore because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all spam.</v>

293
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even though I'm on the do not call</v>

294
00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:52.610
<v Speaker 1>lists and have been since I started it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

295
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:55.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where they get my number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every call I get is some kind of</v>

296
00:14:55.671 --> 00:14:57.500
<v Speaker 1>marketing call.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

297
00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:58.463
<v Speaker 1>it's useless.</v>

298
00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:04.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you learn.</v>

299
00:15:04.881 --> 00:15:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's nice about silicon valley is</v>

300
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:09.560
<v Speaker 1>that it rewards that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

301
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me take that back.</v>

302
00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't reward that it tolerate it</v>

303
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.220
<v Speaker 1>more than I'm a large enterprise where</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes can be career ending in an,</v>

304
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 1>a really bad company where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

305
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.110
<v Speaker 1>where it's a fear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically a,</v>

306
00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:31.111
<v Speaker 1>a corporation that's run on fear versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>encouragement and sticks rather than</v>

307
00:15:32.001 --> 00:15:37.001
<v Speaker 1>carrots tends to be an environment where</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes are not tolerated and then no</v>

308
00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:40.730
<v Speaker 1>innovation happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so silicon valley's the opposite.</v>

309
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it encourage you to take risks and,</v>

310
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs are not rational business</v>

311
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:48.530
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

312
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:53.360
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the risk and reward</v>
<v Speaker 1>curves,</v>

313
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:56.280
<v Speaker 1>we're way out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're taking a lot of risk for,</v>

314
00:15:56.281 --> 00:15:59.570
<v Speaker 1>in the hopes of a lot of reward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really rational.</v>

315
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.590
<v Speaker 1>You actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most business people are much closer to</v>

316
00:16:03.591 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

317
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 1>the origin there where there's some risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some reward but not the kind of</v>

318
00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>risks that entrepreneurs take.</v>

319
00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

320
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mistakes I've made in taking those</v>

321
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:16.550
<v Speaker 1>risks have been numerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

322
00:16:16.551 --> 00:16:18.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

323
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:23.200
<v Speaker 1>there are wine shop or obviously we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning $3,000,000 a month and before we</v>

324
00:16:24.921 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>even had customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

325
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dog food that everybody's eating</v>

326
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.400
<v Speaker 1>back in or the Koolaid that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>was drinking was,</v>

327
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:32.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build these,</v>

328
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 1>build it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a land grab and the eye.</v>

329
00:16:35.241 --> 00:16:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Everyone believed that it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet was a land grabbing.</v>

330
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 1>You had to build this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We built a 20,000 orders at a pick pack</v>

331
00:16:41.121 --> 00:16:45.950
<v Speaker 1>center to automatically fulfill wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a thing of beauty.</v>

332
00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm built it from Greenfield to pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>production in six months.</v>

333
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Had 15 bays for big ups trucks to back</v>
<v Speaker 1>up into and you know,</v>

334
00:16:56.241 --> 00:16:59.330
<v Speaker 1>it never got to ship much wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

335
00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:00.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did actually,</v>

336
00:17:00.861 --> 00:17:03.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those assets were restarted by Kleiner</v>

337
00:17:03.531 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and a new company called new vine</v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics which did ship line in the</v>

338
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:09.260
<v Speaker 1>back end for winery clubs and what have</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

339
00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.510
<v Speaker 1>But it was never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never the,</v>

340
00:17:11.511 --> 00:17:14.660
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity that we all believed it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be.</v>

341
00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

342
00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.240
<v Speaker 1>other mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

343
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you make hiring mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make,</v>

344
00:17:19.061 --> 00:17:22.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strategic mistakes.</v>

345
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 1>You had an opportunity to merge with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company earlier in wine,</v>

346
00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Speaker 1>a wine shoppers history that I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue.</v>

347
00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Hindsight is 20 slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have pursued it.</v>

348
00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

349
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:38.021
<v Speaker 1>each time you get smarter and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other thing you learn to do is you</v>

350
00:17:38.271 --> 00:17:41.810
<v Speaker 1>don't fret over your mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just interest instantly correct and</v>

351
00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.400
<v Speaker 1>move on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You make a bad hire,</v>

352
00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>you gotta make the decision to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

353
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:50.580
<v Speaker 1>this isn't right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not working out and you cut and run</v>

354
00:17:50.581 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and you and hire someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

355
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you can act decisively,</v>

356
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.330
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

357
00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undo the effects of bad decisions.</v>

358
00:17:59.821 --> 00:18:02.450
<v Speaker 1>But I think we all make that decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

359
00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you never made any bad decisions,</v>

360
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you probably weren't taking any risks.</v>

361
00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundraising is hard right now.</v>

362
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:17.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a angels have their personal net</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth have been depleted in some cases</v>

363
00:18:20.431 --> 00:18:22.650
<v Speaker 1>not depleted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly reduced where they're less</v>

364
00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:24.490
<v Speaker 1>willing to take risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

365
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 1>the vcs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some vcs have had trouble closing new</v>

366
00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:29.130
<v Speaker 1>funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

367
00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:34.080
<v Speaker 1>the top vcs have money to spend and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of money that's being</v>

368
00:18:34.081 --> 00:18:35.960
<v Speaker 1>spent and invested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

369
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.510
<v Speaker 1>the way I think of it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

370
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.980
<v Speaker 1>well in terms of the stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will almost always is going to be</v>

371
00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Speaker 1>credit card debt and friends and family</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially.</v>

372
00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very rare that you're going to go</v>

373
00:18:49.171 --> 00:18:53.640
<v Speaker 1>right out of whatever your ideas pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Kleiner Perkins and they're going</v>

374
00:18:53.641 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>to write you a check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to have to prove something</v>

375
00:18:56.730 --> 00:19:01.730
<v Speaker 1>before you can typically raise money</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a vc and the four areas that you,</v>

376
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.450
<v Speaker 1>they look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's four areas of risk and,</v>

377
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.330
<v Speaker 1>and investing is all about risk versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward.</v>

378
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.030
<v Speaker 1>So they want as least as little risk for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most reward.</v>

379
00:19:12.031 --> 00:19:13.500
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to try and reduce that</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>

380
00:19:13.501 --> 00:19:15.360
<v Speaker 1>So there's management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk,</v>

381
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.550
<v Speaker 1>market risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial risk,</v>

382
00:19:17.551 --> 00:19:20.910
<v Speaker 1>and technology risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Management Risk,</v>

383
00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>if you've never run a company before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll do much better going into pitch a</v>

384
00:19:25.531 --> 00:19:28.170
<v Speaker 1>VC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've already got two or three</v>

385
00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:31.080
<v Speaker 1>seasoned people who have run the types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of functions,</v>

386
00:19:31.081 --> 00:19:34.330
<v Speaker 1>you need them to run and done it</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully on your team.</v>

387
00:19:34.331 --> 00:19:38.520
<v Speaker 1>So that reduces management risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People in the company who've done it</v>

388
00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

389
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to do all four of these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to hit to,</v>

390
00:19:42.370 --> 00:19:45.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically hit depending on the investing</v>

391
00:19:45.361 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>climate to two to four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So market risk is,</v>

392
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:53.790
<v Speaker 1>is there a market for your product?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the competitive landscape?</v>

393
00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:54.653
<v Speaker 1>Is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

394
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.960
<v Speaker 1>a billion dollar opportunity because vcs</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically they want to see at least a</v>

395
00:19:57.961 --> 00:19:59.340
<v Speaker 1>billion dollar addressable market.</v>

396
00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.260
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you can't start a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

397
00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

398
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.730
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't have an addressable market</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a billion dollars,</v>

399
00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:07.830
<v Speaker 1>it just means it's probably not a vc</v>
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>

400
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Speaker 1>It's probably a different type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and you don't have to attract</v>

401
00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:16.110
<v Speaker 1>venture to build a great business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As many people know.</v>

402
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm the third one was financial risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

403
00:20:19.381 --> 00:20:22.020
<v Speaker 1>is there a business model?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you actually make money,</v>

404
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a way for this business to</v>

405
00:20:25.621 --> 00:20:29.550
<v Speaker 1>sustain itself and be profitable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth is technology risk,</v>

406
00:20:29.551 --> 00:20:31.520
<v Speaker 1>which if your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

407
00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:35.910
<v Speaker 1>company involves some kind of new</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology or new thing,</v>

408
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 1>have you built one and proven that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be done.</v>

409
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:40.650
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

410
00:20:40.651 --> 00:20:42.590
<v Speaker 1>during the bubble days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in,</v>

411
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.780
<v Speaker 1>in 1998,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 when it was really crazy,</v>

412
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you could probably only have to tick off</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those boxes to get vc funding.</v>

413
00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:54.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

414
00:20:54.101 --> 00:20:58.330
<v Speaker 1>you probably need to tick off pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably all four,</v>

415
00:20:58.331 --> 00:21:00.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

416
00:21:00.071 --> 00:21:04.360
<v Speaker 1>and market and mitigating market risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>means having paying customers,</v>

417
00:21:04.361 --> 00:21:06.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not always the case.</v>

418
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in the past few years there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a rush of money sent into social</v>

419
00:21:10.781 --> 00:21:12.610
<v Speaker 1>media stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

420
00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:14.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

421
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more that you can sort of address</v>

422
00:21:18.011 --> 00:21:23.011
<v Speaker 1>those four issues and do it in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>convincing way through data,</v>

423
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.820
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

424
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beta customers through a letters of</v>

425
00:21:29.291 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 1>intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you can do to sort of increase</v>

426
00:21:32.111 --> 00:21:36.010
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood that you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to execute is going to improve your</v>

427
00:21:36.011 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 1>chances of getting funded.</v>

428
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:43.000
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiring is the most important job of the</v>

429
00:21:43.001 --> 00:21:45.700
<v Speaker 1>CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the hardest in many ways</v>

430
00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:49.240
<v Speaker 1>because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

431
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:51.250
<v Speaker 1>the screening process is broken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

432
00:21:51.251 --> 00:21:54.400
<v Speaker 1>And you get an email on a resume and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to figure out who this</v>

433
00:21:54.401 --> 00:21:57.940
<v Speaker 1>person is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So clearly the screening process means</v>

434
00:21:57.941 --> 00:22:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you're leaving some good people behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

435
00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:02.140
<v Speaker 1>and not so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

436
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:04.750
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's the whole purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>using your network.</v>

437
00:22:04.751 --> 00:22:09.700
<v Speaker 1>If you can find someone who you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow connected with that sort of is</v>

438
00:22:09.701 --> 00:22:12.130
<v Speaker 1>the prescreening process either through</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

439
00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:14.390
<v Speaker 1>So that helps with the screening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

440
00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:15.803
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

441
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:17.500
<v Speaker 1>different people look for different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

442
00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:18.250
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

443
00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:19.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason I'm an entrepreneurs</v>

444
00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:24.280
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not a political animal.</v>

445
00:22:24.281 --> 00:22:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could ever succeed quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly in a big enterprise where,</v>

446
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.500
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this may be unfair to people in big</v>

447
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 1>enterprises where half the battle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ahead is playing the political</v>

448
00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:37.060
<v Speaker 1>game correctly.</v>

449
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:42.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not purely about the best ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in a startup environment,</v>

450
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:46.900
<v Speaker 1>you get a chance to see your ideas tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly and it's not about who you</v>

451
00:22:46.901 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 1>play golf with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I'm hiring,</v>

452
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:54.601
<v Speaker 1>I try to look for people who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeded environments where politics</v>

453
00:22:55.511 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>probably wasn't part of their success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's ways to read that.</v>

454
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.510
<v Speaker 1>You can read it and body language and</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers to certain questions.</v>

455
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really try to wean out the</v>

456
00:23:07.841 --> 00:23:12.841
<v Speaker 1>political animals and focus on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are really good,</v>

457
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:19.230
<v Speaker 1>not just really politically savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing I do is I,</v>

458
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:21.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

459
00:23:21.721 --> 00:23:25.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important to ask them</v>
<v Speaker 1>some questions that,</v>

460
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:28.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more on the human side,</v>

461
00:23:28.811 --> 00:23:32.320
<v Speaker 1>not just the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the work stuff is a given.</v>

462
00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:35.170
<v Speaker 1>Do they have the skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get that out of the way</v>

463
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:36.010
<v Speaker 1>pretty quickly.</v>

464
00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.020
<v Speaker 1>But then you've got a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this someone I want to work with is</v>

465
00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.010
<v Speaker 1>as someone I can trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this someone who's a team player?</v>

466
00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I did with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>first company actually would,</v>

467
00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:50.020
<v Speaker 1>would wine shop or was</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the condition of being hired was that</v>

468
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.440
<v Speaker 1>everyone was gonna make the same base</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary and it was going to be low.</v>

469
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.640
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is when,</v>

470
00:23:57.641 --> 00:23:59.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Kleiner Perkins and Amazon backing</v>

471
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of people who were</v>

472
00:24:01.221 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>coming to us with dollar signs in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

473
00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.180
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to weed out the people that are</v>

474
00:24:05.181 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>really passionate about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity,</v>

475
00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.060
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to only offer for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>

476
00:24:09.061 --> 00:24:11.900
<v Speaker 1>And these were people from becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>seasoned people.</v>

477
00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to only offer $130,000 in</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary.</v>

478
00:24:15.411 --> 00:24:19.640
<v Speaker 1>I'll take that salary and everyone will</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the same salary and for the first</v>

479
00:24:19.641 --> 00:24:23.540
<v Speaker 1>year everyone's going to get the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>salary and that after that there'll be</v>

480
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.440
<v Speaker 1>more merit based.</v>

481
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.350
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was really effective at</v>

482
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.390
<v Speaker 1>building a cohesive team because one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who were in it just for the</v>

483
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:34.340
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a turnoff for them and they</v>

484
00:24:34.341 --> 00:24:36.350
<v Speaker 1>were out the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never even applied.</v>

485
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:41.630
<v Speaker 1>And then</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone felt like there's this whole</v>

486
00:24:41.631 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 1>sort of survey or salary envy thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can happen in a management team.</v>

487
00:24:45.291 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 1>Like how come that person getting paid</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than if everyone knows that</v>

488
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 1>everybody's paid the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it sort of breaks down that one</v>

489
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:53.870
<v Speaker 1>potential for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

490
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.800
<v Speaker 1>a tension in the office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it worked right?</v>

491
00:24:57.830 --> 00:25:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Rebuilt at a wine shop or it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best management team I've</v>

492
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:02.140
<v Speaker 1>ever built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

493
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:06.950
<v Speaker 1>it really was an excellent team and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it,</v>

494
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.750
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tough process though and um,</v>

495
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.290
<v Speaker 1>you do have to move quickly when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>make mistake.</v>

496
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

497
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:18.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it has mostly been in the</v>

498
00:25:18.921 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 1>opportunity with to bond with people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the industry.</v>

499
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Certainly in the bay area where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started most of my businesses,</v>

500
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.330
<v Speaker 1>it's really a nonissue and in fact it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can even be a plus because there's so</v>

501
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:35.570
<v Speaker 1>much networking within the gay world</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

502
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:39.830
<v Speaker 1>But I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an instance where,</v>

503
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple,</v>

504
00:25:42.650 --> 00:25:45.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy who was very senior at facebook</v>

505
00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 1>and is moved on to an even bigger role</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere as a guy.</v>

506
00:25:51.021 --> 00:25:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Really good guy to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very smart guy.</v>

507
00:25:53.001 --> 00:25:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I've known him for 10 years and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

508
00:25:56.421 --> 00:26:01.310
<v Speaker 1>he and another guy I know and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I went on kind of the stag trip to</v>

509
00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:03.470
<v Speaker 1>Las Vegas and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

510
00:26:03.471 --> 00:26:04.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

511
00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:07.880
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't invited and didn't know about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and found out afterwards and it was</v>

512
00:26:07.881 --> 00:26:08.714
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

513
00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they wouldn't have felt</v>

514
00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:16.490
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with me being there because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a stag male bonding thing</v>

515
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:18.740
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I probably wouldn't have been</v>

516
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:20.330
<v Speaker 1>comfortable in it.</v>

517
00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:25.310
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that happens is</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly I've chosen not to have</v>

518
00:26:25.311 --> 00:26:27.170
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realize you can have kids as a,</v>

519
00:26:27.250 --> 00:26:30.710
<v Speaker 1>as a gay adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've chosen not to and I'm</v>

520
00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.570
<v Speaker 1>increasingly people's lives centered</v>
<v Speaker 1>around their families and social</v>

521
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.620
<v Speaker 1>calendars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

522
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:41.650
<v Speaker 1>I think there's just stuff that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not as connected with people because</v>

523
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't up play dates with their kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my kids and all that kind of stuff.</v>

524
00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>So there's some social aspects maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I missed out on,</v>

525
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:54.471
<v Speaker 1>but there's never been any sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with anyone finding out that I</v>

526
00:26:55.561 --> 00:26:59.970
<v Speaker 1>was gay and suddenly not wanting to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>business with me or not wanting to fund</v>

527
00:26:59.971 --> 00:27:01.260
<v Speaker 1>me or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

528
00:27:01.261 --> 00:27:03.420
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>typically what happens because I was</v>

529
00:27:03.421 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 1>afraid to tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I finally told people that have</v>

530
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:09.780
<v Speaker 1>wine shop or um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the management team,</v>

531
00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.130
<v Speaker 1>it was amazing.</v>

532
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 1>It really was amazing and I was in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fraternity in college and,</v>

533
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have learned how to sort of fit into a</v>

534
00:27:19.621 --> 00:27:23.190
<v Speaker 1>very male dominant dominated environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was just fine at it.</v>

535
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I tend to just slip into that.</v>

536
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.851
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:27:26.851 --> 00:27:30.630
<v Speaker 1>what I don't do anymore is I don't feign</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in sports because I'm simply</v>

538
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:33.630
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't feign interest in girls</v>

539
00:27:33.631 --> 00:27:35.400
<v Speaker 1>because I'm simply not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

540
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.610
<v Speaker 1>and so whereas up until maybe even 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

541
00:27:38.611 --> 00:27:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I would sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

542
00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:43.740
<v Speaker 1>jump in on those conversations and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>just felt so wrong.</v>

543
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that was,</v>

544
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:50.370
<v Speaker 1>that's the only issues is maybe just</v>
<v Speaker 1>missing out on some bonding</v>

545
00:27:50.371 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 1>opportunities with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight oriented,</v>

546
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:57.480
<v Speaker 1>like family stuff and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But other than that,</v>

547
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really an issue.</v>

548
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I looked at that question and</v>

549
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

550
00:28:06.781 --> 00:28:10.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my favorite business icon is steve jobs</v>

551
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:13.390
<v Speaker 1>in terms of my role model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

552
00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.720
<v Speaker 1>and he's not gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

553
00:28:15.721 --> 00:28:16.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't,</v>

554
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't think of anyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business world that I knew was gay and</v>

555
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 1>that I think is telling right because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that some of these very</v>

556
00:28:25.231 --> 00:28:27.510
<v Speaker 1>successful business people that are out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are gay,</v>

557
00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.230
<v Speaker 1>but they're not out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why it's difficult to</v>

558
00:28:31.231 --> 00:28:34.170
<v Speaker 1>answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the business world because,</v>

559
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm</v>

560
00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:39.600
<v Speaker 1>confidentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I won't say.</v>

561
00:28:39.601 --> 00:28:44.370
<v Speaker 1>But I can think of five major household</v>
<v Speaker 1>name companies where I know either the</v>

562
00:28:44.371 --> 00:28:48.720
<v Speaker 1>CEO or very senior people who are gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

563
00:28:48.810 --> 00:28:52.380
<v Speaker 1>but they're very careful about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

564
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:54.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:28:54.271 --> 00:28:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the business world is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last frontier I think for,</v>

566
00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

567
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:03.240
<v Speaker 1>that kind of diversity to really take</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold.</v>

568
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

569
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.790
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

570
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

571
00:29:10.161 --> 00:29:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also is very regional.</v>

572
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's big difference if you're trying to</v>

573
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:19.911
<v Speaker 1>do business in perhaps a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative part of the country than it</v>

574
00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:22.890
<v Speaker 1>would be if you're doing business in San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco in New York.</v>

575
00:29:22.891 --> 00:29:25.870
<v Speaker 1>We're really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is completely anon issue.</v>

576
00:29:26.370 --> 00:29:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It's just a relevant.</v>

577
00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are issues.</v>

578
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

579
00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:33.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the,</v>

580
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.360
<v Speaker 1>in the Arab world for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it'd be very challenging.</v>

581
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

582
00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:42.100
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know as much about views on</v>

583
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.980
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I imagine not great.</v>

584
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

585
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.840
<v Speaker 1>the bottom line is that business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you're in the sex business,</v>

586
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.440
<v Speaker 1>there is no reason to mix sex and</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and I'm just like in the</v>

587
00:29:58.511 --> 00:30:01.600
<v Speaker 1>straight world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be inappropriate in a meeting</v>

588
00:30:01.601 --> 00:30:04.960
<v Speaker 1>to discuss your fetishes or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or something like that.</v>

589
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

590
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your wife and all,</v>

591
00:30:09.761 --> 00:30:13.160
<v Speaker 1>you just don't talk about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

592
00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it really doesn't need to be relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't need to be discussed.</v>

593
00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And it would be weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually,</v>

594
00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been of the belief that I</v>

595
00:30:23.321 --> 00:30:28.321
<v Speaker 1>should just be myself and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone asks me,</v>

596
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.941
<v Speaker 1>are you gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

597
00:30:29.941 --> 00:30:33.030
<v Speaker 1>I will answer them honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not going to broadcast that</v>

598
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:33.880
<v Speaker 1>necessarily.</v>

599
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's,</v>

600
00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:37.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

601
00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:40.400
<v Speaker 1>it's a personal characteristic of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

602
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:45.480
<v Speaker 1>I was made this way and it's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody I need to rub in</v>

603
00:30:46.241 --> 00:30:47.470
<v Speaker 1>everybody's face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

604
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.300
<v Speaker 1>it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>

605
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.360
<v Speaker 1>it's an aspect of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no problems with it.</v>

606
00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud of myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't something I need to wear on</v>

607
00:30:55.751 --> 00:30:59.920
<v Speaker 1>my sleeve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I just can't think of,</v>

608
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 20 years of doing business in some</v>

609
00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:07.480
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of any situation where</v>

610
00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it's ever come up in any kind of meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

611
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:12.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big companies,</v>

612
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Sony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dell,</v>

613
00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:16.270
<v Speaker 1>staples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of big corporations.</v>

614
00:31:16.271 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 1>I've met with a New York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

615
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.860
<v Speaker 1>and it just never comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is great.</v>

616
00:31:21.861 --> 00:31:21.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
