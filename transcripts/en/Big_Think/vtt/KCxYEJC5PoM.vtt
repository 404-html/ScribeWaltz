1
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly</v>

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>this is what I know and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something,</v>

3
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was in my early twenties,</v>

4
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:23.151
<v Speaker 1>I was writing all sorts of stories and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote a few of these stories about these</v>

5
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 1>sort of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>and an editor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a editor named Josh Glenn,</v>

7
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>who was the editor of Herman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

8
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>in these stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not in the book.</v>

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make it into the book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't very good and he said,</v>

11
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>but he read the stories and he didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>take them for Herman Monotony,</v>

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>didn't publish them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>you should keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

15
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone who knows these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people the way you do.</v>

16
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was surprised to hear that because</v>

17
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought everybody knew these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I did.</v>

18
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.261
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

19
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a way everybody does.</v>

20
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet there's actually surprisingly</v>

21
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>little writing about them.</v>

22
00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the really</v>

23
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

24
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 1>not terribly surprising but still</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointing criticism of the book has</v>

25
00:01:09.181 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>why do we need to hear about these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know guys just like them,</v>

27
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which strikes me is,</v>

28
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.403
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.410
<v Speaker 1>an invalid form of literary criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also strikes me as a refusal of a</v>

30
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of person to admit that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they belong to a social class.</v>

31
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're willing.</v>

33
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So these are people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>and often this sort of criticism comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from New York.</v>

35
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of provincial criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>from people who believe that their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>little world is not worthy of depiction</v>

37
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>whereas first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not just New York with either a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young literary men all over the country</v>

40
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:54.300
<v Speaker 1>and in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 1>and so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a mistake and the provincial</v>

42
00:01:57.511 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 1>mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they're only in New York,</v>

43
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more than that,</v>

44
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 1>this is actually something that invades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if talks about the intelligentsia,</v>

46
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>right or in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

47
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this literary the sad young literary men</v>

48
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>they form a social class and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to admit that to themselves</v>

50
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Speaker 1>because while they are willing to a be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>social class in terms of using their,</v>

51
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their privilege,</v>

52
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their w,</v>

54
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>if they have money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in their class and their money</v>

55
00:02:27.721 --> 00:02:28.580
<v Speaker 1>privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 1>their access to various media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of privilege.</v>

58
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

59
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the various networks that they have</v>

61
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>access to from the colleges that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to.</v>

62
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow they refuse to believe that</v>

63
00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>there are social class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>that ought to be depicted in literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>except I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except,</v>

66
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>unless it's totally ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

68
00:02:53.101 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is,</v>

69
00:02:54.251 --> 00:02:55.860
<v Speaker 1>this is where hipster culture comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

70
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a hipster culture that,</v>

71
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>that in a way acknowledges that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists as a class and yet only</v>

72
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the least,</v>

75
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>one of the most unattractive things</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the hipster phenomenon is it's a,</v>

76
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>is it's classing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:03:13.811 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its insistence on,</v>

78
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.320
<v Speaker 1>on this form of kitsch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were they,</v>

79
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>they were a trucker hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no trucker hats,</v>

80
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they pretend to be from a</v>

81
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:23.190
<v Speaker 1>different social class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

82
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very good example of this</v>

83
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.470
<v Speaker 1>group of people refusing to acknowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

84
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their class privilege,</v>

85
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

86
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to get back to the book,</v>

87
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>the Saturn Larry men or social class A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ought to be written about,</v>

88
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>they have to be studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsurprisingly,</v>

90
00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.930
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think everybody would be</v>

91
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>writing about them because we're all in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

92
00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and surprisingly little seems to be</v>

93
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:49.850
<v Speaker 1>written about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

94
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.011
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I also think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

96
00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.960
<v Speaker 1>I also hope that the book is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

97
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>is pretty honest about the way these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people behave.</v>

98
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how badly they behave.</v>

99
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>I think we have a fair amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature that is,</v>

100
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>that deals with the men behaving badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>but the men are often depicted as total</v>
<v Speaker 1>cats,</v>

102
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 1>a total lo lifes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>total losers.</v>

103
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys are more complicated than</v>

104
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:23.374
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are capable of being very sweet</v>

106
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:27.521
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

107
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of supportive and nice.</v>

108
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And then also not so nice.</v>
