00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.083
<v Speaker 1>One of the most inspiring stories that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have from my journey around the world </v>

2
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>was when I met a chap called Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Pittsburgh.</v>

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.003
<v Speaker 1>I had nowhere to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd asked lots of people to help me and </v>

4
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>they'd said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

5
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean I had no expectations for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to help.</v>

6
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.870
<v Speaker 1>And I spoke to Tony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

7
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>can I stay with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he looked at me and he said,</v>

8
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

9
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm homeless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I felt a lot of shame,</v>

10
00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 1>but then he said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>if you want to come and stay with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll protect you.</v>

12
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll feed you.</v>

13
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some blankets and that'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>be all good.</v>

14
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And I was in just total shock and I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

15
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>are you being serious?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

16
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:41.734
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I spent the night on the streets of </v>

17
00:00:44.081 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Pittsburgh with one of the kindest men </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever met.</v>

18
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>He was a man that had nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally nothing.</v>

19
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.193
<v Speaker 1>He Fed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>He protected me and he showed me and </v>

20
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>opened up my heart and he was such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind man.</v>

21
00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>And what he did was he showed me the </v>
<v Speaker 1>true wealth is not in our wallets,</v>

22
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's in our hearts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a man that had nothing.</v>

23
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>I could say that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

24
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 1>And he gave me everything and he changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>

25
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>Truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony changed my life.</v>

26
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.363
<v Speaker 1>He changed my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He opened up my heart that he made me </v>

27
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:25.441
<v Speaker 1>realize it's about human connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the true beauty of life is.</v>

28
00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.883
<v Speaker 1>Human connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily what we have in our </v>

29
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:29.614
<v Speaker 1>wallets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be the richest man in the world </v>

30
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>and still be the poorest man in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

31
00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>You can be the poorest man in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be the richest man.</v>
