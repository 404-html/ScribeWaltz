00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.560
<v Speaker 1>In my life as a professional engaged in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business of education,</v>

2
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.280
<v Speaker 1>I frequently find myself involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations about college and career</v>

3
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 1>readiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost always that phrase,</v>

4
00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:19.881
<v Speaker 1>college and Career Readiness Precedes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation between two people,</v>

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>both of whom went to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular kind of college even,</v>

6
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>and the conversation is usually about</v>
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>I think our society hasn't been serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough about the career part of that</v>

8
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a presumption among some people</v>

9
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>that the body of knowledge necessary to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be ready for college level work and the</v>

10
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:50.991
<v Speaker 1>body of knowledge necessary to enter a</v>
<v Speaker 1>career with prospects for promotion are</v>

11
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that there are students,</v>

12
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of students whose</v>

13
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>education after high school will look</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like mine.</v>

14
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I left my public high school in South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolina and moved to Massachusetts and</v>

15
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>went to an ivy league university and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spent four years there,</v>

16
00:01:15.271 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>graduated and went on with my career.</v>

17
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>That is now an unusual experience to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous extent except among education</v>

18
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>policy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be many more students</v>

19
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:33.411
<v Speaker 1>who leave high school and go directly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and start on a path of learning</v>

20
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>from work that's going to lead in very</v>
<v Speaker 1>different directions.</v>

21
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Then my career has led and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that we have done enough at the</v>

22
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:48.111
<v Speaker 1>policy level to explore what those</v>
<v Speaker 1>different pathways might look like and</v>

23
00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>if you ask employers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry leaders,</v>

24
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>they tend to agree with me on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not thinking enough about middle</v>

25
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>skill jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not thinking enough about</v>

26
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:05.961
<v Speaker 1>technical jobs below the level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer and I think our society and</v>

27
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>it's policy makers really need to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>some careful attention to that.</v>

28
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>Probably if if and when we start to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

29
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>we will come upon the tragic absence of</v>
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeships in our American society</v>

30
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.750
<v Speaker 1>in Europe as many as a quarter to a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of any group of teenagers at any any</v>

31
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:37.671
<v Speaker 1>point is pursuing an apprenticeship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that they're getting both</v>

32
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.280
<v Speaker 1>academic training and work training</v>
<v Speaker 1>while being paid by an employer.</v>

33
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 1>They are learning on the job to pursue a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular career and that can be an</v>

34
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:52.660
<v Speaker 1>apprenticeship in software development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be a PR,</v>

35
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>an apprenticeship in hotel management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be an apprenticeship in any</v>

36
00:02:57.511 --> 00:03:02.511
<v Speaker 1>number of things in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have shamefully convinced most high</v>

37
00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>school students that they either need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to Harvard or they need to go to</v>

38
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is significantly more</v>

39
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:16.321
<v Speaker 1>complicated than that in the middle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>where job growth growth is,</v>

40
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.260
<v Speaker 1>where there are jobs that are not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>filled today and too few people in our</v>

41
00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>public policy community are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on what students who are going</v>

42
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>to pursue a career as their pathway out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of poverty,</v>

43
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really need to be getting from their</v>

44
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really need to be getting from the</v>

45
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:42.991
<v Speaker 1>public policy people who are dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>to creating opportunities for them and</v>

46
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to pursue pathways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>look nothing like what we think is</v>

47
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:48.784
<v Speaker 1>traditional.</v>

48
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Because the reality is the notion that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go off to college,</v>

49
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>live in a dorm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to some football games,</v>

50
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:02.221
<v Speaker 1>graduate in four years and go on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life is a persistent myth that has</v>

51
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>very little to do with the lives of most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

52
00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing a degree after high school</v>

53
00:04:08.591 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sooner we get to the point that</v>

54
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>we take the career side of the college</v>
<v Speaker 1>and career readiness equation,</v>

55
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>much more seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better off our society will be.</v>

56
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>The fewer young people we will have who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were in a position of not being in</v>

57
00:04:24.791 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>school or at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the better off we will be in terms</v>

58
00:04:29.351 --> 00:04:34.351
<v Speaker 1>of filling existing jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>requiring high levels of skills for</v>

59
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.050
<v Speaker 1>which there are no employees that.</v>
