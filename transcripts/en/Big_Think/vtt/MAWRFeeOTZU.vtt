<v Speaker 1>Diversity and in any intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

2
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how good ideas arise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to do battle with less good</v>

3
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:23.521
<v Speaker 1>ideas if to the extent that everybody is</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting roughly the same paradigms for</v>

4
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.990
<v Speaker 1>inquiry and there are certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectations about what counts as good</v>

5
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>results of your research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not very good for diversity and</v>

6
00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not very good for intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferment,</v>

7
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>which is what you want to encourage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>universities are set up to get people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work together by having them disagree</v>

9
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what are the difficulties with the</v>

10
00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>relative homogeneity of opinion among</v>
<v Speaker 1>professors is I happened to be at the</v>

11
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>same opinion as most professors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most professors are kind of Liberal</v>

12
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 1>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that it discourages people</v>

13
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 1>from getting into the profession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very difficult to get into</v>

14
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>anyway because they feel are there going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be discriminated against or Sean or</v>

15
00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>just not included in the conversation?</v>

16
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's necessarily would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the case,</v>

17
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's discouraging to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what you want in any</v>

18
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say the same thing if I were a</v>

19
00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>lawyer or a doctor is you want bright</v>
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates to look at your</v>

20
00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>profession as something they would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in getting into if the</v>

21
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:26.821
<v Speaker 1>barriers to entry are really high and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be some requirement that</v>

22
00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>you tailor your views to fit the views</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your colleagues.</v>

23
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It's going to discourage people from</v>
<v Speaker 1>entering it and they'll go do something</v>

24
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>else that's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>more reliable track to a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do worry a lot about the time it</v>

26
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>takes for people to get a phd about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty of finding employment,</v>

27
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:47.620
<v Speaker 1>about the difficulty of getting tenure</v>
<v Speaker 1>and generally about the perception that</v>

28
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>undergraduates have that this is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>high risk career to get started.</v>

29
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want people to feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want people to feel this is something</v>

30
00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>that we fund to do and doable.</v>

31
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

32
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are lots of ways in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities will never be a reflection</v>

33
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>of the general opinion of the public and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably shouldn't be.</v>

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.740
<v Speaker 1>It's generally sort of sociologically</v>
<v Speaker 1>observed that the better educated people</v>

35
00:02:12.741 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more liberal they tend to be,</v>

36
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>which would suggest that professors are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be more liberal than the</v>

37
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 1>general public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that you want to see,</v>

38
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities in any way trying to have</v>

39
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>any kind of quota system about political</v>
<v Speaker 1>views or views in general.</v>

40
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>You want the market to work in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market works.</v>

41
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that one of the things that</v>

42
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.770
<v Speaker 1>would make it a little bit more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get diversity into,</v>

43
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I would just say to oxygenate the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're working in would be to make a</v>

44
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>little easier to get a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think we should just give</v>
<v Speaker 1>more phds,</v>

46
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>but even if we didn't get more phds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we just didn't,</v>

47
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>if we didn't make it eight or nine or 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years to get a Phd,</v>

48
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it would encourage people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enter who would otherwise find lots of</v>

49
00:02:55.941 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 1>reasons why it wasn't a very wise thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
