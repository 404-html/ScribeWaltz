1
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:13.001
<v Speaker 1>Kubler Ross did a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enormous service to medicine and to,</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world at large by drawing</v>

5
00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>attention to the importance of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of basically,</v>

6
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reactions to dying and then to death</v>

7
00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:25.520
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>her insights or whatever her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her ideas,</v>

9
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:34.571
<v Speaker 1>I think about what exactly happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not turned out to be very helpful</v>

10
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>because they don't turn out to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate.</v>

11
00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what,</v>

12
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>what I think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>the trajectory of grief really is</v>
<v Speaker 1>informed very much so by many colleagues</v>

14
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:54.050
<v Speaker 1>who have now done work looking closely</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that,</v>

15
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>process in different kinds of</v>

16
00:00:56.781 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that I put it together in a</v>

17
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>slightly different way than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than maybe some other people do.</v>

18
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:05.570
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that,</v>

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what actually happens when someone dies</v>

20
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:12.261
<v Speaker 1>that you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

21
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that you're very close to.</v>

22
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>That's what really what we're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about here.</v>

23
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't go through such a dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>process when it's someone that,</v>

25
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so this is someone very,</v>

26
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>very close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens,</v>

27
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I understand what happens is that we</v>

28
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>have to start with what is that love</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to start with.</v>

29
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>love is something that we all feel and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're,</v>

31
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.720
<v Speaker 1>we're biologically probably programmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to feel.</v>

32
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 1>And in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in psychology or psychiatry,</v>

33
00:01:47.151 --> 00:01:50.780
<v Speaker 1>we talk about a love relationship as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>attachment relationship.</v>

34
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>And so the attachment system is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological system that actually curves</v>

35
00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.670
<v Speaker 1>and other animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in humans and it,</v>

36
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>it begins even before we're born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So baby can recognize its mother on the</v>

37
00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>very first day of its life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

38
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get that very strong attachment</v>

39
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>relationship between an infant and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>caregiver.</v>

40
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Usually it's mother and other people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's environment.</v>

41
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>And then as the child grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grows older,</v>

42
00:02:17.151 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>there may be a couple of other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

43
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>which it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very attached.</v>

44
00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually what starts to happen also</v>

45
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>as a child gets older is that the child</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to learn how to be a caregiver</v>

46
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>because of course the mother is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>caregiver early on.</v>

47
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as we get older,</v>

48
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:42.350
<v Speaker 1>and by the time we're adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are caregivers for the people that we</v>

49
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>take care of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when someone dies is</v>

50
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>that we lose not only the person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of us,</v>

51
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>but also the person who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who we put a lot of energy and</v>

52
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of ourselves into taking care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually it turns out that for</v>

53
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you make them decide,</v>

54
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>is it more important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>if you make them choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it more important to take care of</v>

56
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>someone else or to be taking care of</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

57
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any idea what they'd say?</v>

58
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 1>So basically they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will always say,</v>

59
00:03:20.251 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 1>most of the time say that it's much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to feel good about taking care</v>

60
00:03:23.581 --> 00:03:25.530
<v Speaker 1>of someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

61
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's go back to the bereavement</v>

62
00:03:28.081 --> 00:03:33.081
<v Speaker 1>situation because what's happened is</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone has died who's very important to</v>

63
00:03:33.331 --> 00:03:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you to being a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the person who,</v>

64
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you turn to when you're under stress or</v>

65
00:03:39.301 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 1>the person who's kind of behind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheering for you when you're,</v>

66
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>when you're trying something new or</v>
<v Speaker 1>having confidence in you when you're</v>

67
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 1>doing something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's very important,</v>

68
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is also the person that you do</v>

69
00:03:53.011 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 1>those things for and that you try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect and help in their life.</v>

70
00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:59.490
<v Speaker 1>So when they die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by definition,</v>

71
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.210
<v Speaker 1>you failed as a caregiver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things,</v>

72
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:07.590
<v Speaker 1>so basically the two things that happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone dies is that attachment</v>

73
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:09.390
<v Speaker 1>system gets very activated.</v>

74
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>And so does the caregiver system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean in everyday</v>

75
00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would that means that you start to</v>

76
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:18.150
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to manage without this</v>

77
00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 1>person?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you also think,</v>

78
00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 1>why didn't I prevent this death?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have done,</v>

79
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have done something to make it</v>

80
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:27.474
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have,</v>

81
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the World Trade Center.</v>

82
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.180
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people had the thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't I stop this person from going</v>

83
00:04:33.181 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 1>to work that day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

84
00:04:34.681 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>even though it was not rational thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are not rational thoughts.</v>

85
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're going to manage without</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person.</v>

86
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Of course you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:42.151 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>do something to lead to this person's</v>
<v Speaker 1>death.</v>

88
00:04:45.211 --> 00:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>But they're automatic instinctive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

89
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>So that's the first thing that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you start to have these different</v>

90
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>kinds of problems to solve and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really acute grief.</v>

91
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what you start to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you start to think a lot about,</v>

92
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to find the person for both</v>

93
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:03.660
<v Speaker 1>reasons in your mind because we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think a very special place in our</v>

95
00:05:06.751 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>minds for the person who we're so</v>
<v Speaker 1>attached to.</v>

96
00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 1>And so what we have to do is we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>gradually come to terms with the fact</v>

97
00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:21.561
<v Speaker 1>that that person is gone forever and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that information is very difficult.</v>

98
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

99
00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Very difficult to accept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't accept it right away.</v>

100
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.680
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

101
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:36.340
<v Speaker 1>we feel a sense of disbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we also,</v>

102
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that,</v>

103
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will,</v>

104
00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>will feel like they're going to see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person walking into the room that</v>

105
00:05:42.581 --> 00:05:47.350
<v Speaker 1>somehow they have that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they are slate between facing it</v>

106
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>and then setting it aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you get this kind of oscillation</v>

107
00:05:50.681 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 1>during acute grief and gradually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

108
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

109
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find some way,</v>

110
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>and people do this differently to but to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the fact,</v>

111
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gone and that it's natural for</v>

112
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Speaker 1>people to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

113
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:10.451
<v Speaker 1>you come to terms with that emotionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as kind of cognitively or in</v>

114
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>your thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have two basic forms of grief and</v>

115
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.801
<v Speaker 1>you have this oscillating trajectory</v>
<v Speaker 1>that eventually leads to a place where,</v>

116
00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 1>where it's in the background and where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of revisit it from time to</v>

117
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:29.370
<v Speaker 1>time in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
