1
00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>The ceiling of it emotion is a process</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is distinct from having the emotion</v>

2
00:00:09.891 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>in the first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in order to understand what is an</v>

3
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it feeling,</v>

4
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>we need to understand what is an emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an emotion is the execution of a</v>

5
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>very complex program of actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some actions that are actually movements</v>

6
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 1>like movement that you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your face,</v>

7
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.590
<v Speaker 1>in fear a or movements that are internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened in your heart or in your</v>

9
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>gut and movements that are actually not</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscular movements,</v>

10
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>but rather releases of molecules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say for example,</v>

11
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>in the endocrine system into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bloodstream,</v>

12
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.160
<v Speaker 1>but it's movement and action in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>broad sense of the term.</v>

13
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.450
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an emotional consists of a very well</v>

14
00:00:54.451 --> 00:00:59.451
<v Speaker 1>orchestrated set of alterations in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>body that has as a general purpose,</v>

15
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making life more survivable by taking</v>

16
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>care of a danger or taking care of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity either or,</v>

17
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>or something in between.</v>

18
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that is set in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>genome and that we all have with a</v>

19
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:23.631
<v Speaker 1>certain program nature that is modified</v>
<v Speaker 1>by our experience.</v>

20
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>So individually we have variations on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom,</v>

21
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>but in essence your emotion of joy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine are going to be extremely similar.</v>

22
00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>We may express them physically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly differently and it's of course</v>

23
00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>graded depending on the circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the the,</v>

24
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>the essence of the process is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the same unless one of us is not</v>

25
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>quite well put together and is missing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

26
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's going to be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the same across even</v>

27
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>other species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know there's a way that we may smile</v>

28
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.911
<v Speaker 1>and the dog may wag the tail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in essence we have a set program and</v>

29
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:13.410
<v Speaker 1>those programs are similar across</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals into species.</v>

30
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Then the feeling is actually a portrayal</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what is going on in the Oregon is</v>

31
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>when you're having an emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's really the next thing that</v>

32
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:28.314
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

33
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>If you have adjusted emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would not necessarily feel it.</v>

34
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>To feel an emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to represent in the brain in</v>

35
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>structures that are actually different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the structures which lead to the</v>

36
00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going on in the organism when</v>

37
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:49.851
<v Speaker 1>you're having the emotion so you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>define it very simply as the process of</v>

38
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>perceiving what is going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organism,</v>

39
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:58.761
<v Speaker 1>when you are in the throes of an emotion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is achieved by a of structures.</v>

40
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Some move the chair in the brainstem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of which are in the cerebral</v>

41
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>namely the insular Cortex,</v>

42
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>which I like to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because I think it's the most</v>

43
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:12.090
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

44
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think it's the number</v>
<v Speaker 1>one structure,</v>

45
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>a controlling our feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I like to mention it because it's</v>

46
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>something that people didn't really know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about and many years ago,</v>

47
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>which probably now are going close to 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

48
00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought that the incident would be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>important platform for feelings.</v>

49
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>That's where I started and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis and turns out that the</v>

50
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis is perfectly correct and 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago we had the first experiments</v>

51
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:46.741
<v Speaker 1>that showed that it was indeed so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since then a countless.</v>

52
00:03:46.751 --> 00:03:51.751
<v Speaker 1>Studies have shown that when you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>having feelings of emotion or feelings</v>

53
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>of variety of other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the insula is active.</v>

54
00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't mean that it's the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that is active and there are other</v>

55
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>structures that are very important as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

56
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he emotion opera?</v>

57
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Very often when you think about how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>react to the world,</v>

58
00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>something is happening to you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're simply going along and your being</v>

60
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:25.890
<v Speaker 1>confronted by different things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily very important or</v>

61
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.900
<v Speaker 1>significance for your ultimate life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you are constantly reacting to the</v>

62
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking about the world in your</v>

63
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.540
<v Speaker 1>acting on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And emotions are engaged when the stakes</v>

64
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.790
<v Speaker 1>outside of your organism are fairly high</v>
<v Speaker 1>in positive or negative directions.</v>

65
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>And this of course comes from ancient</v>
<v Speaker 1>times in biology when you were</v>

66
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.860
<v Speaker 1>constantly being subject to potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>threats and to potential opportunities.</v>

67
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>The threats were obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

68
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>predation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.260
<v Speaker 1>or inclement weather or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.670
<v Speaker 1>physical environments where you would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like having a precipice,</v>

71
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 1>a or a hole on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>the opportunities are also very easy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

73
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:25.780
<v Speaker 1>They have fundamentally to do with food</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with sex.</v>

74
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.890
<v Speaker 1>And so the motions were placed there in</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution is incredibly smart devices</v>

75
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:40.620
<v Speaker 1>that rather than having you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the problem,</v>

76
00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>would deliver a solution and make sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would act right.</v>

77
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 1>It's in a way a contribution to a sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of on auto pilot that we've inherited</v>

78
00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>through all these millions of years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

79
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.610
<v Speaker 1>So if there is an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion is going to make sure that you</v>

80
00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:05.890
<v Speaker 1>at some level know that it's there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to have the tendency</v>

81
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>to act on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there is a threat,</v>

82
00:06:09.321 --> 00:06:14.321
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be alerted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even before you're alerted to the</v>

83
00:06:14.781 --> 00:06:16.160
<v Speaker 1>threat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as such,</v>

84
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be placed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances that are likely to make</v>

85
00:06:20.901 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>you either freeze or run away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger.</v>

86
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a level of response to the</v>

87
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.840
<v Speaker 1>world that is automated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's largely nonconscious.</v>

88
00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it happens,</v>

89
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:36.530
<v Speaker 1>nonconscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you'd take consciousness of it</v>

90
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:41.030
<v Speaker 1>because once it's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you start feeling what is happening</v>

91
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.940
<v Speaker 1>and connecting the feeling to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're perceiving,</v>

92
00:06:43.941 --> 00:06:47.010
<v Speaker 1>then you realize how hard there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>danger or ha,</v>

93
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.460
<v Speaker 1>here's the next lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

94
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.720
<v Speaker 1>and so there is a level in which you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will have a way in which the entire</v>

95
00:06:56.211 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>process then is made conscious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enters your mind flow.</v>

96
00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

97
00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>even at this level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the influence on one's</v>

98
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 1>behavior is astounding and it's by and</v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

99
00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>extremely useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has of course its downsides because</v>

100
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>you may be responding to things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>better not respond to either on the</v>

101
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>negative and positive side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that you should not take the bait.</v>

102
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>You should not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

103
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>fall for every opportunity and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should not allow yourself to be made</v>

104
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:30.680
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>angry,</v>

105
00:07:30.681 --> 00:07:33.650
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or fearful when there is no cause for</v>

106
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

107
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a,</v>

108
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 1>a way in which by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the influences very positive,</v>

109
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then it,</v>

110
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.830
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

111
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>the experiences of emotion also have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of modeling what your going to do</v>

112
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:53.330
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because unlike say,</v>

113
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>a squirrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a who is not going to think much about</v>

114
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>his or her experiences of emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do,</v>

115
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 1>and we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we have feelings because those</v>

116
00:08:05.451 --> 00:08:10.451
<v Speaker 1>feelings can actually stay in memory in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the elaborations that we make</v>

117
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:13.610
<v Speaker 1>about the feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

118
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>using language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we have a possibility of using</v>

119
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>feelings of certain emotions for future</v>
<v Speaker 1>planning and that makes a huge</v>

120
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

121
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a little animal that doesn't have</v>

122
00:08:27.441 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Speaker 1>much mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:34.310
<v Speaker 1>and no advanced planning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of keeping alive for animals</v>

124
00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 1>like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of keeping alive sometimes,</v>

125
00:08:38.811 --> 00:08:43.811
<v Speaker 1>but an even better way of constructing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the world and making sure that</v>

126
00:08:45.741 --> 00:08:47.440
<v Speaker 1>that view is taken into consider</v>

127
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.900
<v Speaker 2>when we plan future events.</v>
