00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I was raised with a Tarion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

3
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.350
<v Speaker 2>my mother said she took us to church so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we wouldn't,</v>

4
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Get religious later in life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was above and both my parents were</v>

6
00:00:18.371 --> 00:00:23.371
<v Speaker 2>atheists and my grandmother was an</v>
<v Speaker 2>atheist and in rural Kentucky.</v>

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 2>And so they were trying to make sure</v>
<v Speaker 2>that my brother and I would be atheist</v>

8
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:27.880
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it worked,</v>

9
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't mean that we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't teach us a lot of,</v>

10
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of wonder of science and of nature</v>

11
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 2>in the world and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they gave us all of that,</v>

12
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 2>but they are</v>

13
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>both highly skeptical people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that</v>

14
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.581
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

16
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:55.300
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't,</v>

17
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 2>the only problem was that my mother's</v>
<v Speaker 2>parents were southern Baptists and</v>

18
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>devout and it was very upsetting them to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea,</v>

19
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.913
<v Speaker 3>mmm.</v>

20
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.260
<v Speaker 2>That we didn't believe in God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I told him that I did because I</v>

21
00:01:08.261 --> 00:01:12.010
<v Speaker 2>thought that was really cool because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were worried that we would go to</v>

22
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:12.844
<v Speaker 2>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

23
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my grandmother asked me</v>

24
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>

25
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about anything except that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you count what you believe in God.</v>

26
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>I think in this next one I'm working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure because it</v>

27
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 2>definitely reared its head in modern day</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking.</v>

28
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

29
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I just came from an interview where</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lewis Black was coming in right after me</v>

30
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>and I had met him before and we talked</v>
<v Speaker 2>about all of this.</v>

31
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.673
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

32
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 2>it's everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's talking.</v>

33
00:01:40.051 --> 00:01:40.861
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's of course,</v>

34
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 2>a huge evangelical movement recently and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now there's a,</v>

35
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 2>there's an atheist movement that often</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to me,</v>

36
00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 2>I was raised to be really nice to people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of out there beliefs.</v>

37
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so a lot of it seems really overly</v>

38
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 2>self righteous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>odd.</v>

39
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>Like in the same way that evangelicals</v>
<v Speaker 2>are where it is.</v>

40
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.650
<v Speaker 2>I just think it's not,</v>

41
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe any of that stuff,</v>

42
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 4>but I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not mad about it.</v>
