<v Speaker 1>Daniel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor at the Harvard Graduate</v>

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.593
<v Speaker 1>School of Education.</v>

3
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects of and mixed at best,</v>

4
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>the centerpiece of the administration's</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy was of course no child left</v>

5
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>behind NCLB,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had I think,</v>

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>a few commendable goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of and,</v>

7
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>and for that reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supported by people across the</v>

8
00:00:27.461 --> 00:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>aisle as well by George Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

9
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:31.480
<v Speaker 1>on that in the house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by Teddy Kennedy,</v>

10
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the goals was as George Miller</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it,</v>

11
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:39.481
<v Speaker 1>to shine light in the corners to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard for schools that did well on</v>

12
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 1>average to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>the data if they were doing poorly with</v>
<v Speaker 1>disadvantaged kids.</v>

15
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.020
<v Speaker 1>So there was a real emphasis in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in improving and improving equity.</v>

16
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my view,</v>

17
00:00:52.181 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>is a very poorly crafted policy is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real sledgehammer.</v>

18
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It set a required setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary targets,</v>

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>many of which are unreachable by what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>would consider legitimate means.</v>

20
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And it made test scores the end all and</v>
<v Speaker 1>be all of education.</v>

21
00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>It made it impossible or very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult</v>

22
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 2>for teachers considering anything but</v>
<v Speaker 2>raising scores on tests.</v>
