1
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will actually because</v>

2
00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>it's still a great medium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>until somebody invents a cheap</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic paper different from a</v>

4
00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:28.870
<v Speaker 1>kindle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I still think is too complex and</v>

5
00:00:28.871 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>too expensive for the average person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's still going to be a</v>

6
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>place for newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I do think is seven day a week,</v>

7
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>large metropolitan papers or even</v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller community papers,</v>

8
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not viable based on the revenue</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming in that really we have to</v>

9
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you'll see is news organizations</v>

10
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>that do not identify themselves with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>form of distribution.</v>

11
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>They're information companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge companies that then distribute</v>

12
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>on video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They distribute databases or they make</v>

13
00:01:03.191 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>available databases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do print additions,</v>

14
00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>they do specialty magazines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do whatever works for the customer</v>

15
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>and the advertiser and whatever makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense financially.</v>

16
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't make sense to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

17
00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have to find financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to do it.</v>

18
00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to find a different way to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

19
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>We spent an enormous amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things that don't have much value.</v>

20
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does the New York Post and the New</v>

21
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>York Daily News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they have to have separate people</v>

22
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>producing the NBA box scores in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper?</v>

23
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>What added value for the customer are</v>
<v Speaker 1>they producing?</v>

24
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't we put our efforts where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>really provide value to the user?</v>

25
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Wherever the user is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.410
<v Speaker 1>wanting to read it as kitchen table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>riding a bus,</v>

27
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being across halfway across the world</v>

28
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and wanting to know what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City.</v>

29
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>W why can't we create value that way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we can because you can see</v>

31
00:02:07.651 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>people paying for content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they pay for content that they</v>

32
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>perceive provides them benefit or value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment or otherwise.</v>

33
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll become more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation along the line of a blog</v>

34
00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>where the reader participates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>expertise from outside starts to</v>

35
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we see published.</v>

37
00:02:35.051 --> 00:02:37.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at Wikipedia,</v>

38
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia is a brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.680
<v Speaker 1>and successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>media initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've created a new form of</v>

41
00:02:45.701 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 1>encyclopedia that's living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's breathing and,</v>

42
00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of a wikipedia for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>community like shouldn't the local news</v>

43
00:02:53.801 --> 00:02:57.490
<v Speaker 1>organization be the in depth resource</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a community?</v>

44
00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>So if you know more about care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example in healthcare financing and</v>

45
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>health care insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why shouldn't you be able to work with</v>

46
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>me as we're explaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know how the Obama administration's</v>

47
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>healthcare policies will affect</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado.</v>

48
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>So I think the involving of and bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in will be a really important</v>

49
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>part of whatever anything looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this interactivity,</v>

50
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>that conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that inclusiveness that it's not us</v>

51
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 1>telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually us working with you and</v>

52
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand and answer your</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

53
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.660
<v Speaker 1>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reader will be answering questions</v>

54
00:03:34.661 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in a much more</v>

55
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>participatory world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that's better and we</v>

56
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:44.770
<v Speaker 1>might have more information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have to think of ourselves maybe</v>

57
00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>as more curators and moderators and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as originators.</v>

58
00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Typically with local media companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought they had to produce</v>

59
00:03:53.681 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only way to trust anything.</v>

60
00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I think we're in a different era.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is self policing.</v>

61
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.730
<v Speaker 1>There's ways that things can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>checked for accuracy because others look</v>

62
00:04:06.821 --> 00:04:09.670
<v Speaker 1>at them and comment on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

63
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>so I'm not pessimistic about the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually optimistic about it.</v>

64
00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>I just recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it's gonna look like.</v>

65
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And the solutions are not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to come from the traditional media</v>

66
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:25.480
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether their scripts or hearst or</v>

67
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>mcclatchy or the New York Times.</v>

68
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they at least contribute to correcting</v>

69
00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>it because let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 1>let's take healthcare and we have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single payer,</v>

71
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody with a single payer perspective</v>

72
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>to health insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then we have a free market and it</v>

73
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>aren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't we be the people to encourage</v>

74
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>dialogue and create an environment for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dialogue?</v>

75
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Because if it's not going to happen on</v>
<v Speaker 1>our site,</v>

76
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>and if we're not going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>inform it and answer the questions,</v>

77
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen somewhere else and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will die.</v>

78
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>And there'll be some new form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I think the most conventional view of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future is everything is going to</v>

80
00:05:02.381 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>become much more opinionated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to sort of,</v>

81
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to your own affinity group and your</v>

82
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a single payer person,</v>

84
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>so I'm only going to read people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that's the way the world should</v>

85
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>

86
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And I'm going to find people who think</v>
<v Speaker 1>like me and that's where I'm going to</v>

87
00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 1>congregate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a legitimate point of view</v>

88
00:05:20.661 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 1>in that very well may be what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping,</v>

89
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not of the mind that that's what I</v>

90
00:05:26.951 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>want to see happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see a richer environment</v>

91
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:34.630
<v Speaker 1>than that where people get connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>views other than their own.</v>

92
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And I think wikipedia is an example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that where they try to,</v>

93
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create reliable,</v>

94
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.880
<v Speaker 1>though it is not always reliable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but either is the mainstream media and</v>

95
00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:47.290
<v Speaker 1>this idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000
<v Speaker 1>there's been this glory days of</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers when everything was perfect.</v>

97
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

98
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:56.260
<v Speaker 1>newspapers have always tried to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers.</v>

99
00:05:56.261 --> 00:05:57.094
<v Speaker 1>There's been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>a sensational aspect of some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been different,</v>

101
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things done to create customer</v>

102
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>interest and to keep loyalty.</v>

103
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.480
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there was this great days</v>
<v Speaker 1>of newspapers and our democracy was so</v>

105
00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:16.061
<v Speaker 1>perfect and now it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually think it's better now because</v>

106
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.520
<v Speaker 1>more people can participate and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a greater ability to learn more quickly.</v>

107
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>If you think of the tools available to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist today versus the tools</v>

108
00:06:26.961 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>available even 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so incredible.</v>

109
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just using search engines to find</v>

110
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:35.870
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

111
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.980
<v Speaker 1>using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>the fact that a journalist on the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have an iphone or a blackberry</v>

113
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>where he or she's opening documents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading things.</v>

114
00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:45.253
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

115
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:50.430
<v Speaker 1>it moves so much more quickly now that</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires a highly skilled journalists</v>

116
00:06:50.961 --> 00:06:53.390
<v Speaker 1>and how are we going to pay for the</v>
