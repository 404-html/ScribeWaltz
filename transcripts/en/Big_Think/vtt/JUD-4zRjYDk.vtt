1
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is a very,</v>

2
00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it's actually very difficult field</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need probably above</v>

3
00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>everything else extraordinary patients.</v>

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And what keeps you going is discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes,</v>

6
00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lifetime you may have one</v>

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>outstanding discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>Einstein used to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was unusual in that he had had</v>

9
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any one would have been enough to</v>

10
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 1>have kept him going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>most scientists are not in that league,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all have at some scale,</v>

12
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that were know,</v>

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>really very proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we do,</v>

14
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>if we discover them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>often we are looking for them.</v>

16
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that a lot of discovery is</v>

18
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.981
<v Speaker 1>serendipitous and accidental is</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendously,</v>

19
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>tremendously overplayed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's much more likely that once</v>
<v Speaker 1>see something almost in everyday life</v>

21
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>that puzzles you and you carry it around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with you for some period of time and</v>

22
00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.920
<v Speaker 1>then you see some way of connecting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

23
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say our discoveries and autism</v>

25
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>is an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At a very early age.</v>

26
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:28.851
<v Speaker 1>I was impressed by this child and later</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw an opportunity and I struck when the</v>

27
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>opportunity was there to satisfy my</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosity.</v>

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>So most discoveries of that tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you see things that you can't</v>

29
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>explain and action say sometimes a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time you see things that you can't</v>

30
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes you come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations that are really exciting</v>

32
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>and 99% of the time those are wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's really some trivial explanation</v>

33
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>to the thing that's gotten you excited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Early in my career I used to hate those</v>

34
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>things and I used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a manic depressive would love</v>

36
00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>living like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

38
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>you see something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

39
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.060
<v Speaker 1>You have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you come up with some great encompassing</v>

40
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>idea that'll explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to change how people think</v>

41
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>and then the next day you realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were really a dumb ass.</v>

42
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays when those things happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually really enjoy them because</v>

43
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>there are so few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>real Eureka moments in one's life that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to almost enjoy the fake ones.</v>

45
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>

46
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feeling is just as good.</v>

47
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.500
<v Speaker 1>So I've actually gotten to enjoy those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those weird results that we can't</v>

49
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>come up with fanciful ideas and then try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to batter them,</v>

51
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>and then you get a double satisfaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you end up destroying the idea.</v>

52
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:48.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's satisfying I</v>

53
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>to destroy the idea almost as much fun</v>
<v Speaker 2>to destroy an idea's too as to create</v>

54
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
