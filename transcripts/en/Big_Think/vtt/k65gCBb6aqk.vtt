1
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Which meant it turns out was a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>central part of the constitution of the</v>

2
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning it's obscure.</v>

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.550
<v Speaker 1>People don't know about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it probably was necessary for the</v>

4
00:00:19.551 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>constitution actually to be ratified by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American people.</v>

5
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 1>You can see the impeachment clause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to explain its content in</v>

6
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can see it as,</v>

7
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the American revolution itself</v>

8
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 1>in the sense that the revolt against a</v>
<v Speaker 1>king who was a leader who had authority</v>

9
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:43.940
<v Speaker 1>over we the people was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>incomplete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we didn't have a mechanism by which</v>

11
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>we could get rid of our leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the president,</v>

12
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 1>which was a way of ensuring that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have anything like a monarchy.</v>

13
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way impeachment worked is that in</v>

14
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>the early American colonies before</v>
<v Speaker 1>America was America,</v>

15
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>we started impeaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.740
<v Speaker 1>people who were following orders from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the king.</v>

17
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>And what that meant was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>an abusive authority would be called out</v>
<v Speaker 1>by some legislative assembly.</v>

19
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>And in the initial phase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would happen would be there just be</v>

20
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:27.830
<v Speaker 1>a vote that the person had abused</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

21
00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>And then if the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>fell to completion and this goes back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

23
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the trial the person would be</v>

24
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:41.930
<v Speaker 1>convicted of the offense for which</v>
<v Speaker 1>impeachment was had and if convicted,</v>

25
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:46.910
<v Speaker 1>the person would be removed from office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to bring this back to the American</v>

26
00:01:46.911 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>structure as a developed after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and after the constitution</v>

27
00:01:50.421 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>came into place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was thought through with such</v>

28
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:56.660
<v Speaker 1>care in Philadelphia when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution was debated,</v>

29
00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>the idea was that if there is a high</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and misdemeanor and we can talk a</v>

30
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>bit about what that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if there's trees in or bribery,</v>

31
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>then the house of Representatives by</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority vote can impeach the president,</v>

32
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:14.030
<v Speaker 1>the vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Court justices,</v>

33
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the cabinet.</v>

34
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.970
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is there's a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>official,</v>

35
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment that the person has done</v>

36
00:02:23.571 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>something very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad.</v>

37
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proceeding moves to the Senate,</v>

38
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 1>which is acting like a court and which</v>
<v Speaker 1>decides whether to convict,</v>

39
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>which means to remove the person from</v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

40
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 1>The house makes the impeachment vote by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a majority vote.</v>

41
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean anyone has to leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

42
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>It then goes to the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if it votes by a two thirds</v>

43
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Speaker 1>to convict on the ground on which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood say president was impeached,</v>

45
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>then the person is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 1>as they say about baseballs that are hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard,</v>

47
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>the president has gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

48
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>because the word high crimes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdemeanors seems to mean kind of</v>

50
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>felonies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high crimes and misdemeanors.</v>

51
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>The normal current reader would think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

52
00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>is there a crime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back to the 18th century,</v>

53
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a lot more inspiring like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then that and um,</v>

54
00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of fitting with a system that's</v>

55
00:03:24.881 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>committed to us self government.</v>

56
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's call it a jaywalking or</v>

57
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>shoplifting or not paying your income</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>

58
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>that's not a high crime or misdemeanor</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the constitutional sense.</v>

59
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>What is meant by high crime and</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdemeanor is an abuse of official</v>

60
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:49.471
<v Speaker 1>authority and shoplifting or income tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>evasion.</v>

61
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an abuse of official authority.</v>

62
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.310
<v Speaker 1>If the president of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's suppose a decides,</v>

63
00:03:57.311 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to pardon every police officer</v>
<v Speaker 1>who shot an African American,</v>

64
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not itself likely to be a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president has the pardon power,</v>

65
00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>but that is definitely an impeachable</v>
<v Speaker 1>offense.</v>

66
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Madison spoke of abuse of the</v>

67
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.960
<v Speaker 1>pardon power as an impeachable offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the president of the United States</v>

68
00:04:16.961 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>decides I'm going to go on vacation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paris for the next six months cause it's</v>

69
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.880
<v Speaker 1>really beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly not a crime but it's an</v>

70
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>impeachable offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an egregious neglect of uh,</v>

71
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the authority of the office.</v>

72
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>So abusive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the authority of the office,</v>

73
00:04:33.431 --> 00:04:36.550
<v Speaker 1>if it's egregious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardon power example would be one.</v>

74
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the president of starts invading</v>

75
00:04:38.771 --> 00:04:43.771
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties in a terrible way by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>locking people up for insufficient</v>

76
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by going crazy in terms of security</v>

77
00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>measures at airports and borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by going crazy,</v>

78
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm using that as kind of a legal term</v>
<v Speaker 1>of art really exceeding the bounds of</v>

79
00:04:56.741 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 1>the reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not a crime,</v>

80
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>but that is an abuse of authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there were right back in,</v>

81
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the impeachment clause,</v>

82
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 1>which is I think first and foremost way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of preserving our are our rights and</v>

83
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>liberties and a way of calling out an</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority who has invaded them.</v>

84
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Think now about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>what the American revolution was fought</v>
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

86
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And so I've spent a lot of the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>months in the 18th century and uh,</v>

87
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people back then,</v>

88
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.270
<v Speaker 1>we're on the impeachment issues and</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential authority issues.</v>

89
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.270
<v Speaker 1>They were off the charts good in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate in Virginia on whether we should</v>

90
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>ratify the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One really,</v>

91
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned person said,</v>

92
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>we cannot ratify this constitution and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason is the pardon power and it</v>

93
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:55.900
<v Speaker 1>was urged by the skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president could participate in</v>

94
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>something really sinister with one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his advisors.</v>

95
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Then his advisor is in legal trouble and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the president can pardon the person</v>

96
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.401
<v Speaker 1>for engaging in illegal or corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity that the president initiated.</v>

97
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.910
<v Speaker 1>How can we allow a constitution that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in it?</v>

98
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:17.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was stated with great precision</v>

99
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>as an objection to the constitution as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>recall by someone who had actually</v>

100
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 1>signed the declaration of independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know that person was at the</v>

101
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>constitutional convention and refuse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace it.</v>

102
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.610
<v Speaker 1>James Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.630
<v Speaker 1>very quietly responded and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the gentleman has overlooked</v>

104
00:06:36.861 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>something isn't about a sweet way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

105
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>responding to someone when the stakes</v>
<v Speaker 1>are super high.</v>

106
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Whether we're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution is the gentleman is</v>

107
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 1>overlooked something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Madison explained if the</v>

108
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.750
<v Speaker 1>president uses the pardon power to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelter someone who's done something</v>

109
00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:06:57.741 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>there's something available on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>

111
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Impeachment and Madison actually did his</v>
<v Speaker 1>interlocutor one better.</v>

112
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 1>The interlocutor was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the president advises something</v>

113
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.630
<v Speaker 1>terrible and participates and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pardons the person.</v>

115
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that awful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madison said,</v>

116
00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awful.</v>

117
00:07:18.501 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's impeachable Madison's words</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to go beyond that to say,</v>

118
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>if you pardon someone who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's done something terrible or one of</v>

119
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>your own people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's itself a legitimate grounds for</v>

120
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>impeachment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which suggested that abusive the pardon</v>

121
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:40.181
<v Speaker 1>power in the words of James Madison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an impeachable offense.</v>

122
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>And with respect to the meaning of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constitution,</v>

123
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is hazardous to argue with James</v>

124
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Madison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beauty of the impeachment mechanism</v>

125
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>is its connection with the principle</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have a republican,</v>

126
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>not a monarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means it puts we the people in</v>

127
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.104
<v Speaker 1>charge.</v>

128
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>That means that invocation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impeachment mechanism,</v>

129
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a democratic president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Republican president,</v>

130
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 1>really depends on we the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think of examples,</v>

131
00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was some interest in under</v>

132
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>President Bush and President Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some interest in impeaching them.</v>

133
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.660
<v Speaker 1>thank goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>

136
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>even if we didn't like either of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>

137
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:32.450
<v Speaker 1>didn't think there was an impeachable</v>
<v Speaker 1>offense under President Nixon.</v>

138
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 1>By contrast and I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

139
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.650
<v Speaker 1>very unfortunately under president</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton because he didn't commit an</v>

140
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 1>impeachable offense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but under both of them,</v>

141
00:08:41.721 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 1>there was a public demand for getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>rid of him on the ground that,</v>

142
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Nixon had,</v>

143
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abused his presidential authority to,</v>

144
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover up crimes and also had himself use</v>

145
00:08:57.211 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>presidential authority to invade civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and civil liberties,</v>

146
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that got people,</v>

147
00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever their political affiliation</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently charged up that they</v>

148
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>we're willing to go along with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the House of Representatives</v>

150
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to impeach Nixon or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>fueled that.</v>

151
00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.750
<v Speaker 1>In the Clinton case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

152
00:09:18.751 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 1>there was a thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

153
00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.480
<v Speaker 1>perjury and obstruction of justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were the charges against President</v>

154
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing good about them.</v>

155
00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.190
<v Speaker 1>They're very bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't,</v>

156
00:09:29.191 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 1>in his case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impeachable offenses under the</v>

157
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

158
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:36.660
<v Speaker 1>people were charged up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were charged up.</v>

159
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So whether the president is a Democrat</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Republican,</v>

160
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:44.280
<v Speaker 1>whether it's president trump or in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

161
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

162
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left or center president,</v>

163
00:09:47.311 --> 00:09:51.300
<v Speaker 1>if people think that there's something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really is beyond the Pale,</v>

164
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 1>and that's not the constitutional tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the kind of Colloquia who have</v>

165
00:09:55.681 --> 00:10:00.681
<v Speaker 1>getting at the constitutional task</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond the Pale of a legitimate uses of,</v>

166
00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:03.300
<v Speaker 1>of authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we,</v>

167
00:10:03.301 --> 00:10:05.160
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

168
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the boss.</v>

169
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:08.730
<v Speaker 1>So the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the boss?</v>

170
00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first three words of the</v>

171
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 1>constitution say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

172
00:10:12.241 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>the people and the impeachment clause</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of makes that real.</v>
