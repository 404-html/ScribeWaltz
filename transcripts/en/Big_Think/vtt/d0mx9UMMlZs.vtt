WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>We are shaped by group level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection processes so that we can be</v>

2
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>like bees in a hive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>we are not just primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We evolved to fight it out with other</v>

4
00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>we are part way through a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition evolutionary history that</v>

6
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>allows us to be temporarily like bees in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hive.</v>

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>We see this after a attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw it after nine 11.</v>

8
00:00:29.811 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>We can come together our propensity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find meaning,</v>

9
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>even though it may have evolved from</v>
<v Speaker 1>simpler cognitive mechanisms as Richard</v>

10
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Dawkins and others maintain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I believe that our ability to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections to see connections in the</v>

12
00:00:43.311 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look up at the sky,</v>

13
00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>we see stories about people wandering</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and going on missions.</v>

14
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that our ability to find</v>

15
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>connections and meaning helps us merge</v>
<v Speaker 1>together into groups,</v>

16
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can function as one.</v>

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this is part of the psychology that</v>

18
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>allows us to create these emergent super</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

19
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>at least temporarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's ever been in part of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a chorus or band or played a team</v>

21
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>sport or been initiated into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fraternity,</v>

22
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>knows the joy is the ecstasy of losing</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in part of a larger group.</v>

23
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the next frontier for</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychology and for the social sciences</v>

24
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>is understanding that we are not radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>

25
00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>We are actually in part bees in a hive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't live that way.</v>

26
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reason for as much,</v>

27
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.123
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

28
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 1>We are deeply and profoundly</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmation secrets not truth seekers.</v>

29
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>The most important rule in psychology is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that thinking is for doing.</v>

30
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Now there are some people whose task it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to find the truth.</v>

31
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>So you might think they would use</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking to find the truth.</v>

32
00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>And there are some philosophers I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are very open minded.</v>

33
00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:52.130
<v Speaker 1>There are some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers are human beings too.</v>

35
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use reasoning to reach the</v>

36
00:01:56.061 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that they find a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>amenable or conducive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look back at the divisions</v>

39
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.740
<v Speaker 1>of the mind and realize that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>language ability,</v>

40
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>our ability to think in words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not come about so that we could</v>

41
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:13.990
<v Speaker 1>figure things out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Language came about to communicate and</v>

42
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>especially to influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use reasoning to influence others,</v>

43
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>to manage our reputation to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

44
00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 1>to work out well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what will people think of me if I do</v>

45
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

46
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And is that person trying to cheat me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use reasoning,</v>

47
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>in a machiavellian way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite often.</v>

49
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are capable of using it to find the</v>

50
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 1>truth when we don't care about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

51
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>And this is why the natural sciences do</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a good job.</v>

52
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>They can really reason their way to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion offered by the data and the</v>

53
00:02:40.941 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>social sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a big problem.</v>

54
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of us are liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in economics,</v>

55
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>but in psychology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociology,</v>

56
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.800
<v Speaker 1>anthropology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of us are liberal.</v>

57
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.950
<v Speaker 1>So we reasoned our way to conclusions we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to reach,</v>

58
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>which are liberal conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>and this makes it very hard for us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand society,</v>

60
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

61
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.800
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

62
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>The basic personality trait is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicts ideology best is openness to</v>

63
00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just a fact about the</v>

64
00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:14.840
<v Speaker 1>distribution of personality types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just as some people are extroverted,</v>

65
00:03:14.841 --> 00:03:17.480
<v Speaker 1>some introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always going to be the case as part</v>

66
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:20.840
<v Speaker 1>of a genetic shuffle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people just like novelty</v>

67
00:03:20.841 --> 00:03:22.970
<v Speaker 1>variety and diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people like what's familiar.</v>

68
00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really glad it's this way.</v>

69
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need in any community we need people</v>

70
00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:31.130
<v Speaker 1>of both types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens now that we have so much</v>

71
00:03:31.131 --> 00:03:34.880
<v Speaker 1>geographic mobility is the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are high in openness to experience can't</v>

72
00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 1>stand to live in small towns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all moved to New York and San</v>

73
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Francisco and Boston create communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are very high in openness to</v>

74
00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:43.070
<v Speaker 1>experience in which there is no moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

75
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas other people who are born low</v>

76
00:03:45.051 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and more on openness to experience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>move out.</v>

77
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we now get geographic and social</v>

78
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:53.210
<v Speaker 1>clustering where we only have to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people who are like us.</v>

79
00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food is really,</v>

80
00:03:54.501 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>really good where we liberals live</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we like ethnic foods.</v>

81
00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>We like variety in the more conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the country.</v>

82
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It seems like all the restaurants are</v>
<v Speaker 1>applebee's because they don't like</v>

83
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>bright in diversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.220
<v Speaker 1>that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this basic personality trait,</v>

85
00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives so much else that happens and</v>

86
00:04:10.011 --> 00:04:13.820
<v Speaker 1>leads us to cluster into groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be that at least if you were</v>

87
00:04:13.821 --> 00:04:15.530
<v Speaker 1>born in one place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were likely to stay,</v>

88
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.880
<v Speaker 1>that most people stayed and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with people who were near</v>

89
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:21.380
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're often different from you.</v>

90
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Not Anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we've got lots of,</v>

91
00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.220
<v Speaker 1>of racial and ethnic diversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

92
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.420
<v Speaker 1>But we've been able to purchase it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of almost no model diversity.</v>

93
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.330
<v Speaker 1>The data suggests that Americans are</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the happiest people in the world.</v>

94
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 1>it's the scandinavians also do extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>well on that.</v>

96
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing to realize for</v>

97
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>those who doubt that those who doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Americans are happy is to realize</v>

98
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:53.640
<v Speaker 1>that happiness is really local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.190
<v Speaker 1>our society is screwed up in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

100
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a lot of poverty.</v>

101
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.320
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot of injustice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a broken political system,</v>

102
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of that matters for happiness.</v>

103
00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>But for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our happiness comes from our local</v>

104
00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our relationships,</v>

105
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:10.680
<v Speaker 1>from having control over our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

106
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I do think the data suggests that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 1>freedom is good for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

108
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.860
<v Speaker 1>up to a point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.590
<v Speaker 1>mobility and diversity are not so good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people.</v>

110
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

111
00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do make us trust our neighbors</v>

112
00:05:22.741 --> 00:05:23.640
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

113
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:27.990
<v Speaker 1>so anything that fosters strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships and stable,</v>

114
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.820
<v Speaker 1>a stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a healthy,</v>

115
00:05:29.821 --> 00:05:31.560
<v Speaker 1>cohesive communities is generally good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us.</v>

116
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anything that fosters anime and</v>

117
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>distrust and chaos is bad for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think America could do a lot better.</v>

118
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:42.090
<v Speaker 1>I think we could be even happier than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are if we could fix some of our social</v>

119
00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:43.260
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

120
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 1>but I do think that despite all of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

121
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans seem to be doing pretty well</v>

122
00:05:47.731 --> 00:05:49.020
<v Speaker 1>on a happiness scale.</v>

123
00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.113
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

124
00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Myth of pure evil is a term</v>

125
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 2>coined by the psychologist Roy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baumeister.</v>

126
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which talks about a kind of a narrative</v>

127
00:06:03.141 --> 00:06:05.160
<v Speaker 2>that we all have in our minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

128
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>it's parodied most perfectly in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Austin Powers movies in which there is a</v>

129
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Dr Evil who does evil because he loves</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do evil.</v>

130
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:15.350
<v Speaker 2>There's no other motive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just likes to do evil.</v>

131
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

132
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 2>we on the other hand are perfectly good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fight evil.</v>

133
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So it takes extent that you have bumper</v>
<v Speaker 2>stickers on your car.</v>

134
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't like abortion,</v>

135
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:25.300
<v Speaker 2>don't have one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

136
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think that you are on the good side</v>

137
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:31.870
<v Speaker 2>and those ignorant fools and the other</v>
<v Speaker 2>side are evil,</v>

138
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>driven by ignorance or greed.</v>

139
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we liberals tend to think about racism</v>

140
00:06:35.901 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 2>in this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially.</v>

141
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.340
<v Speaker 2>We think that racism is pure evil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>racism happens for no reason.</v>

142
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 2>It just falls out of the sky.</v>

143
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a disease and a virus.</v>

144
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 2>We must all unite to fight this pure</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

145
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>This is what I mean when I say morality</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a team sport and Airside is united by</v>

146
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 2>fighting the pure evil of racism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

147
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 2>the reality is always more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>as baumeister shows,</v>

148
00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>even in domestic violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most obvious cases of</v>

149
00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:04.130
<v Speaker 2>apparent case of pure evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're looking at domestic</v>

150
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>racial assaults,</v>

151
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>murder especially,</v>

152
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:09.250
<v Speaker 2>there's usually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

153
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an escalation.</v>

154
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 2>There's usually some fault on both</v>
<v Speaker 2>sides.</v>

155
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:14.960
<v Speaker 2>It hurts me to say that I know that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people watching this are going to be</v>

156
00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 2>offended because I've just said</v>
<v Speaker 2>something sack religious for our,</v>

157
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:19.710
<v Speaker 2>our social justice side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

158
00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is always more</v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

159
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:24.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you cannot understand the atrocities in</v>

160
00:07:24.321 --> 00:07:26.390
<v Speaker 2>the world by thinking they are caused by</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

161
00:07:26.391 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all the trustees are caused by</v>

162
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 2>people pursuing the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who believe at the ends.</v>

163
00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:34.280
<v Speaker 2>Justify the means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no pure evil.</v>

164
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 2>It's actually moral motives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cloaked in a cloak of self</v>

165
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 2>righteousness.</v>
