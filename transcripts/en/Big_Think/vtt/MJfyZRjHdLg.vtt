00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science is telling us that we can do</v>

2
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>phenomenal things if we put our minds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our resources to us.</v>

3
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think science is probably the best</v>

4
00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:27.291
<v Speaker 1>example of you put resources into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you let the creativity and</v>

5
00:00:27.691 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>the brilliance of the minds throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and certainly not only in this</v>

6
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the world,</v>

7
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>and phenomenally good things can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make sure that there's</v>

8
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.730
<v Speaker 1>checks and balances on that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>science can also lead to things that are</v>

9
00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>not so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

10
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And that is a whole ethical issues of</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulating at the genomics,</v>

11
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>at the genomic level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole issues of,</v>

12
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>of embryos and creating people to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own fashionable boutique,</v>

13
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>liking all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to really be very,</v>

14
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>very careful that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but science at its most pure where</v>

15
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>you're sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking for discovery and you're</v>

16
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>going to use discovery for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>betterment of mankind.</v>

17
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>I think science stands out among more</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the most important,</v>

18
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>endeavors that the humankind can pursue.</v>

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Mankind evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:21.861
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that we have evolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole issue of evolving through</v>

21
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>various lower species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To our own species of the human.</v>

22
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>But there's also the continuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>

23
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>that is associated with mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that is using what</v>

25
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>specifically and particularly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>peculiarly makes you a human being.</v>

26
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And that is your intellect and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

27
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>You have a choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can analyze things and you can act</v>

28
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>in an intellectual manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is to me that the very</v>

29
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:57.891
<v Speaker 1>foundation of what science is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can better your own lot,</v>

30
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>the lot of the other citizens of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world while you're paying attention to</v>

31
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 1>and preserving the world you live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the reason why things like the</v>

32
00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:10.800
<v Speaker 1>environment are so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so important.</v>

33
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>When we try and analyze all we doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are detrimental to the</v>

34
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.860
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>

35
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 1>how do we stop it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we have to stop it,</v>

36
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>how do we replace it with something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's environmentally friendly?</v>

37
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think science is going to lead us</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

38
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's the goodwill that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try and preserve your own species as</v>

39
00:02:31.321 --> 00:02:33.010
<v Speaker 1>well as preserve the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

40
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our planet.</v>

41
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that we can have thousands of more</v>

42
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>years of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

43
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

44
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>of people doing good things and leading</v>
<v Speaker 1>good lives.</v>
