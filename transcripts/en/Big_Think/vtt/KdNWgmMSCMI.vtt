1
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I was waiting for a banker to drop off</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cash to me,</v>

2
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way I could you can function in</v>

3
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan is you have to have cash</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is no banking system,</v>

4
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>there is no credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no check.</v>

5
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 1>So I had a big coat like lots of pockets</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that code and every day between 100,</v>

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>$200,000 stuff in my pockets and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay people cash as they were.</v>

7
00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.990
<v Speaker 1>Corruption is beyond words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the second most corrupt country in</v>

8
00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it's well on its way to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one after Somalia.</v>

10
00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when you see people,</v>

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>there is no laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules or regulation,</v>

13
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.140
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go and say,</v>

14
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just gave you 50,000.</v>

15
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>He could come back and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no you didn't.</v>

16
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what to do about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's not like United States while</v>

17
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to call my lawyer.</v>

18
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>You just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That money is gone.</v>

19
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>So you just have to feel people and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to trust.</v>

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>So I needed to make weekly payments to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the staff.</v>

21
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:21.651
<v Speaker 1>And the workers and a crew and he um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me that they cannot leave the set</v>

22
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:31.401
<v Speaker 1>because I was shooting as if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>please bring me $50,000 by 6:00 PM at</v>

23
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>this location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

24
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming with a black car.</v>

25
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never met him before he came.</v>

26
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>I saw a black car parked in front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw him and he says,</v>

27
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>get in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got in the car,</v>

28
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>we'd go out on the corner and I'll pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>you the money because I had to give</v>

29
00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:56.361
<v Speaker 1>70,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had 20,000 and I needed 50,000 and uh,</v>

30
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>seven and keep going and going and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am getting almost out of the city</v>

31
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

32
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>where are we going?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

33
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much do you have?</v>

34
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>How much do I have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

35
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>where does my money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much do you have?</v>

36
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Any what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you talking about.</v>

37
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.460

<v Speaker 1>aren't you with the bank?</v>

38
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd bring me money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black car coming in,</v>

39
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>bringing me the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just laughed.</v>

40
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.931
<v Speaker 1>I really like this abnoxious</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughed at.</v>

41
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Just chills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>in the bone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at him,</v>

43
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you want?</v>

44
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

45
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>I could hold you and get some money or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could kill you and get some money,</v>

46
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>or if you have some money you could give</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to me.</v>

47
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:54.840
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how much you have.</v>

48
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>I said I have $20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't my pocket.</v>

49
00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I handed to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I showed it to him.</v>

50
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take me,</v>

52
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to give you money because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've already written leather's not to</v>

53
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>release me from the Taliban if I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught.</v>

54
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's useless.</v>

55
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can have this like you have to</v>

56
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.651
<v Speaker 1>take me back right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and excuse me.</v>

57
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how I negotiate my deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

58
00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next thing that happened was,</v>

59
00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was for four days after that,</v>

60
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was writing me at security</v>

61
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

62
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.570
<v Speaker 1>we changed security companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite dolphin also because you know,</v>

63
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't know who is involved with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>security company,</v>

64
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these bodyguards which we had</v>

65
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 1>between 80 and 70 a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them could be,</v>

66
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>the one that has ready to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was sitting in my car and I'm with</v>

68
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>one of these bodyguards that's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>3:30 in the morning.</v>

69
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going on a set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>5:00,</v>

70
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.370
<v Speaker 1>then a couple of hours of category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit north of Kabul and all of a</v>

71
00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>sudden it's dark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm looking for my telephone and my</v>

72
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:21.030
<v Speaker 1>bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm searching for that lesson.</v>

73
00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.040
<v Speaker 1>I felt something soft and I put the</v>
<v Speaker 1>light of my phone on it.</v>

74
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:29.410
<v Speaker 1>That is a hand that chopped up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hence sitting right next to me.</v>

75
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Every hair on my body stood up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

76
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said to drive it.</v>

77
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the car.</v>

78
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad as a hand.</v>

79
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 1>And the other seat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he looks at me,</v>

80
00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

81
00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was coming to pick you up,</v>

82
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:49.060
<v Speaker 1>there was a suicide bombing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The windows were open and probably some</v>

83
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.480
<v Speaker 1>lymph fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

84
00:04:52.481 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it out of the car.</v>

85
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:54.281
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

86
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can stop right now.</v>

87
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I got to take you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'll bury it somewhere.</v>

88
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>I still think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>

89
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>you honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never think something like this</v>

90
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 1>could ever happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it does happen and then</v>

91
00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>you have to live with it and it just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see either this was planned to scare me</v>

92
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>or if it was a fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth he was telling me</v>

93
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.550
<v Speaker 1>in either case it showed to me how cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>and callous people have become,</v>

94
00:05:32.681 --> 00:05:37.681
<v Speaker 1>how nonimportant death is an unlimited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The car is like not a big deal.</v>

95
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.840
<v Speaker 1>It just to him it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

96
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 1>another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another problem that we just got to take</v>

98
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 1>care of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the numbness that people have seen</v>

99
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.801
<v Speaker 1>so much death and destruction that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just wasn't nothing.</v>

100
00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know which one was worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finding data or finding his reaction to</v>

101
00:05:58.931 --> 00:06:00.130
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.480
<v Speaker 1>a lot of little stories like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
