1
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.600
<v Speaker 1>Moving into a completely new era of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

2
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.473
<v Speaker 1>and I describe it in two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the end of the era of western </v>

3
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:18.774
<v Speaker 1>domination of world history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hasten to add it's not the end of </v>

4
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.214
<v Speaker 1>the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The West will remain single strongest </v>

5
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>civilization for long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time to come,</v>

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:30.683
<v Speaker 1>but it can no longer dominate the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way it has for the last 200 </v>

7
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>years and the second aspect of this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>era.</v>

8
00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.284
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's the return of Asia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the return of Asia seems rather </v>

9
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now actually if you look at not the last</v>

10
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>200 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but look at the last 2000 years,</v>

11
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>the two largest economies of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>have consistently been China and India.</v>

12
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So if China and India become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again the Rogers economies,</v>

13
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>as everyone predicts in the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

14
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.280
<v Speaker 1>it will clearly be returned to know and </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we shouldn't be surprised.</v>

15
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.133
<v Speaker 1>It's going to happen.</v>
