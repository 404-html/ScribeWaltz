1
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>That wouldn't bother with all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>football as</v>

2
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bumped in and it's got to be there</v>

3
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>sort of head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders above anyone else,</v>

4
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>terms of the way that hearing him as</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by.</v>

5
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a whole battalion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

6
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.460
<v Speaker 1>everyone from Nina Simone's talk to Van</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison know,</v>

7
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick Drake is a Koan,</v>

8
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Joni Mitchell.</v>

9
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole sway that people like the</v>

10
00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 1>specials and the Qr code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was obsessed with the Kule for ages.</v>

11
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I love the smell of them live a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of times in the midnight sees that would</v>

12
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.973
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

13
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a couple.</v>

14
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Walden was the water boys.</v>

15
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>This is the sea at Cardiff University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 85.</v>

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just went straight through the</v>

17
00:01:13.321 --> 00:01:18.000
<v Speaker 1>curfew and played for like three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was such a brilliant record and</v>

18
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 1>he was at the peak of his powers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike Scott at that point,</v>

19
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>he'd already written songs like</v>
<v Speaker 1>fisherman's blues and things that</v>

20
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>appeared later and he played them at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show and I remember instantly liking</v>

21
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard it before.</v>

22
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And he played a couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played a couple of covers and he just</v>

23
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>went on and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way they will change the</v>

24
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>instruments that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that show.</v>

26
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>And then the same year I went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glastonbury for the first time and the</v>

27
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>cure headlined Saturday night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>that was the head of the door album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a brilliant record,</v>

29
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>but they just did a brilliant set and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>and as it used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite as clean and neat and tidy as</v>

31
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the pyramid stage,</v>

32
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.250
<v Speaker 1>they had a laser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to be a laser,</v>

33
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>the laser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the headline,</v>

34
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I could use it.</v>

35
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>So the cure got to use the laser and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there a bit out of my brains with my</v>

36
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>little friend from school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>unless thunderstorm came into the moon</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going down and like the sun was of</v>

38
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>other movements coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun was going down and then there's</v>

39
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>just this huge storm came in and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was thunder and lightning and all the</v>

40
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:27.590
<v Speaker 1>dry ice was being dragged across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>

41
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>It just looked fantastic and they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>played through all the stuff.</v>

42
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>

43
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was blown away by Glastonbury.</v>

44
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so obsessed by music.</v>

45
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I must have seen about 40 bands like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cure was.</v>

46
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>That was the.</v>
