00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I suppose I'm an opinion maker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I publish a lot.</v>

2
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I give a lot of speeches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I try to analyze things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide leadership.</v>

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't do it within an organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university has been a base for me to</v>

5
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>do it to the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend a lot of time abroad.</v>

6
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans to do that now because our</v>

7
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>role in the world is so confused at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>

8
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850
<v Speaker 1>by writing and teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an opinion makers.</v>

10
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.960
<v Speaker 1>I think they're very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

11
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm a generalist in a world is full of</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialist.</v>

12
00:00:53.211 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm a generalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've caught in a number of different</v>

13
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know a great deal about a lot of</v>

14
00:01:01.551 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>I have tried to focus on big questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sub.</v>

16
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I've tried intentionally to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>generalist and that's unusual in the</v>

17
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>modern world and a lot of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very suspicious of that,</v>

18
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's very important for</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody to try to figure out how the</v>

19
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>whole thing fits together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the lack of that is a real</v>

20
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>problem that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the most important thing I've</v>

21
00:01:27.081 --> 00:01:32.081
<v Speaker 1>done is to try to be a generalist and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide some leadership and some</v>

22
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 1>perspective in that.</v>
