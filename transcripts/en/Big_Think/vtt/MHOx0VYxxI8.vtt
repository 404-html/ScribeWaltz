00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.850
<v Speaker 1>The autism flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think that it is accurate to</v>

2
00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:13.851
<v Speaker 1>say that the information technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry made other countries,</v>

3
00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>particularly the United States recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the changes that had taken place in</v>

4
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>India and recognize the potential</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of course it was for some time</v>

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>the largest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>exchange between India and the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States was in the IT industry.</v>

7
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>And of course this is not only because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are on opposite sides of the globe.</v>

8
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.473
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day or night factor plays very</v>

10
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>nicely for walk in both countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because a fairly large number</v>

11
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>of Indian origin Americans in Silicon</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valley,</v>

12
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.860
<v Speaker 1>we're making their mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were part of the innovative ideas</v>

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>that were germinating in the silicon</v>
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>

14
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:03.771
<v Speaker 1>They were part of the way the connection</v>
<v Speaker 1>was made between Bangalore and the</v>

15
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

16
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that maybe the recognition by</v>

17
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.120
<v Speaker 1>by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 1>United States came as the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ICT expanded.</v>

20
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.693
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

21
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are lots of other</v>

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>areas in which as well we have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>institute for Economic Exchange.</v>
