1
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously when you're going to cut</v>

2
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start with data,</v>

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>which businesses are underperforming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which product lines are underperforming,</v>

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>which people are underperforming and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

5
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>start there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:21.841 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>what I think often happens is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company's hope for some natural process</v>

7
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>of attrition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things start to get difficult.</v>

8
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>They kind of take across the board cuts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's almost never a good idea.</v>

9
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>just recently I was having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with a cfo in a large</v>

11
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>company and they had just kind of had</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of a blanket policy that every</v>

12
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>division,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every a national organization was going</v>

13
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>to have to take down head count by 10%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

14
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is across the board.</v>

15
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>No exceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no exceptions.</v>

16
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a mandate.</v>

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.581
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>surely that can't be a the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

19
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have divisions that have great</v>

21
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>growth prospects.</v>

22
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 1>You have others that have gone fat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lazy,</v>

23
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.833
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

24
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why just do it across the board?</v>

25
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's fair.</v>

26
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is that fair?</v>

27
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some businesses are already lean,</v>

29
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>so is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can that possibly be fair?</v>

30
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>He thought him and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

31
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's easy.</v>

32
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy is usually not a good criteria for</v>

33
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>making a business decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

34
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the starting approach for any kind of</v>

35
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:27.771
<v Speaker 1>smart cost cutting is really a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very careful analysis of what's grown</v>

36
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going lazy,</v>

37
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>where do we have great prospects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do we don't?</v>

38
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>But costs cutting should never be</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniform.</v>

39
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>

40
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Number two I think is smart costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting.</v>

41
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>You spend a lot of time talking to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about what's happening.</v>

42
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly some people are going to have to</v>

43
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you avoid demoralizing all</v>

44
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>the folks that are left?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>first you have to be honest about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing in the environment.</v>

46
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>That's not too hard at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people get that we're in a very,</v>

47
00:01:56.451 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 1>very deep recession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also have to be kind of have a</v>

48
00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>due process and make sure that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat of trying to uh,</v>

49
00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>bring your costs back in line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not indiscriminate and how you</v>

50
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 1>let people go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're taking people one at a time,</v>

51
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you're really evaluating their</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution.</v>

52
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 1>They understand why it's they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person and not the person next door</v>

53
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 1>to them that is being asked to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you have to cut deep enough so</v>

54
00:02:22.581 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>you feel that you're cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not kind of the slack,</v>

56
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>not the beat team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're cutting people out of the</v>

57
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.423
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>

58
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>You also want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you possibly can,</v>

59
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>let people know that you're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>rehiring,</v>

60
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to want to reengage</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

61
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but do the whole process in a way where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you not destroyed their loyalty,</v>

62
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>their emotional connection to the firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means explaining why it's</v>

63
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being sure that,</v>

64
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:46.130
<v Speaker 1>that they understand why it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.840
<v Speaker 1>why certain people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not other people.</v>

66
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And if you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them at least the hope that</v>

67
00:02:50.631 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a rehire when the economy starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tick up.</v>

68
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Do all of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can get through a lot of</v>

69
00:02:56.031 --> 00:03:00.450
<v Speaker 1>the costs cutting without an undermining</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the morale your company or without</v>

70
00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 1>finding that doof kind of cut off some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most valuable people that you've</v>

71
00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>eaten the seed card as it were</v>
<v Speaker 1>inadvertently in the midst of a crisis.</v>

72
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.250
<v Speaker 1>So I think you have to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very careful in the way you do this and</v>

73
00:03:14.251 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 1>you have to recognize that recessions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are temporary.</v>

74
00:03:17.371 --> 00:03:19.490
<v Speaker 1>We've come out of everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during our lifetimes we're going to come</v>

76
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:24.570
<v Speaker 1>out of this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you often find is that the</v>

77
00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>companies that had to cut less deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're able to,</v>

78
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.380
<v Speaker 1>to kind of soldier through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did not lose key resource is the not,</v>

79
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:34.500
<v Speaker 1>bring their key capital projects to</v>
<v Speaker 1>halt.</v>

81
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.310
<v Speaker 1>Those are the companies that gain market</v>
<v Speaker 1>share on the upturn.</v>

82
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>Cause you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is really hard to rehire.</v>

83
00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Lease great people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talented people.</v>

84
00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.770
<v Speaker 1>It takes a long time to find that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring them back on board again.</v>

85
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Make them productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes time to get those capital</v>

86
00:03:49.891 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>projects underway again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can find ways of cutting less</v>

87
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>deeply through the depths of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recession,</v>

88
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely have an advantage coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the recession.</v>

89
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Now it's also true that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some companies over higher,</v>

90
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.980
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is usually kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>political thing.</v>

91
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in most organizations we measure</v>

92
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>people's authority and kind of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>status by the size of their budget and</v>

93
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>the size of their headcount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's kind of an imperial listing</v>

94
00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>that people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want bigger teams,</v>

95
00:04:16.051 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 1>more people and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to keep that in check.</v>

96
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:19.911
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

97
00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:23.940
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep constant attention on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all of those key productivity</v>

98
00:04:23.941 --> 00:04:27.990
<v Speaker 1>measures and make sure that at no point</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you grow to those things get</v>

99
00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>significantly out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

100
00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:31.770
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a fast growing market,</v>

101
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:34.880
<v Speaker 1>your fast growing company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to hire a bit above,</v>

102
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.671
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:36.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demand curve because it takes a</v>

105
00:04:38.211 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>while to bring people on board and get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them up to speed.</v>

106
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.190
<v Speaker 1>But you want to watch those ratios very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very carefully.</v>

107
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that they never get out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>

108
00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 1>that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you at at every moment through the</v>

109
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>down and the up curve that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

110
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that you are paying attention there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop paying attention for a</v>

111
00:04:55.681 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 1>moment is very easily for people at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of the organizations to pad their</v>

112
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:02.850
<v Speaker 1>teams with more people to hire a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>indiscriminately.</v>

113
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And then you suddenly find out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>when times are tough again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of slack and you're going</v>

115
00:05:08.381 --> 00:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>to have to put the organization to a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trauma to get rid of that.</v>

116
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.930
<v Speaker 1>So be careful when you hire right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't over hire,</v>

117
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.280
