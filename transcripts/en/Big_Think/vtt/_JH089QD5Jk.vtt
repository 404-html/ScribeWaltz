1
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm just curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would life look like if it had</v>

2
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>evolved from viruses instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacteria?</v>

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Maybe life did evolve from viruses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just don't know it.</v>

4
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.411
<v Speaker 1>Doo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doo,</v>

5
00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doo,</v>

6
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.023
<v Speaker 1>Doo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doo Doo.</v>

7
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sure looks like a bacteria went off</v>

8
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

9
00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:30.251
<v Speaker 1>when I talking some more about me in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>book undeniable,</v>

10
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>which I like to think of as a primmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a primer on evolution,</v>

11
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I speculated that viruses should have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own domain of life.</v>

12
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>The VIRA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in Latin would be second</v>

13
00:00:43.191 --> 00:00:46.440
<v Speaker 1>declension now and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Latin,</v>

14
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>apparently they did not have a plural of</v>
<v Speaker 1>virus.</v>

15
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 1>They never needed one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never used it in the way we use it</v>

16
00:00:53.271 --> 00:00:55.190
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

17
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if life evolved from</v>
<v Speaker 1>viruses,</v>

18
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 1>but in my own experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am thoroughly charmed by the science</v>

19
00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:06.821
<v Speaker 1>fiction story and drama to strain where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the compartmentalization of the chem</v>

20
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.040
<v Speaker 1>chemicals needed for life was done with</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystals rather than with membranes.</v>

21
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

22
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>but bacteria are different from viruses</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that bacteria have these separate</v>

23
00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.400
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas viruses seem to be a single</v>

24
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you might think of as a single</v>

25
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>molecule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so viruses are more akin to proteins</v>

26
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>then they are at a bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but proteins are created by bacteria.</v>

27
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:45.701
<v Speaker 1>So it is very reasonable that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ancestor to viruses and bacteria so</v>

28
00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:52.121
<v Speaker 1>that they have in common a common</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical ancestor proving that seems to</v>

29
00:01:53.301 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>me it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be possible.</v>

30
00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>When I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people celebrated and questioned and</v>

31
00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:05.261
<v Speaker 1>thought hard about the Miller array</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment or Array Miller experiment</v>

32
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.500
<v Speaker 1>done by these two scientists who tried</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create the conditions of the</v>

33
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:16.931
<v Speaker 1>primordial earth in a big glass flask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

34
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:22.310
<v Speaker 1>apparently the one thing they didn't all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way figured out was sulfur,</v>

35
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.870
<v Speaker 1>which now people generally believe would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come into the earth's atmosphere</v>

36
00:02:26.871 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>from volcanoes.</v>

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>When I was in school at Cornell</v>
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>

38
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:36.761
<v Speaker 1>I walked into the space sciences</v>
<v Speaker 1>building when Carl Sagan was very active</v>

39
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching classes and stuff and they had</v>

40
00:02:41.421 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>the early Miller experiment running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the big glass flask with these</v>

41
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:51.251
<v Speaker 1>electrodes sparking because it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>presumed or it is presumed that in the</v>

42
00:02:52.101 --> 00:02:57.020
<v Speaker 1>ancient atmosphere there was lightening</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this electricity could cause</v>

43
00:02:57.021 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>chemical changes that would happen very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very.</v>

44
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that you would look</v>
<v Speaker 1>for or try to create molecules</v>

45
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.450
<v Speaker 1>that through their natural existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>created copies of themselves.</v>

46
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>And so that was the goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that creating amino acids,</v>

47
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>these are biological molecules that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a carbon with a double bond and an</v>

48
00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>oxygen on the side that turns out amino</v>
<v Speaker 1>acids aren't apparently that hard to</v>

49
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we find them in asteroids and we</v>

50
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:39.031
<v Speaker 1>find them all over the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists or chemists have been able to</v>

51
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:44.161
<v Speaker 1>create amino acids that have the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern but don't exist in nature or we</v>

52
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.064
<v Speaker 1>haven't found them.</v>

53
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And living systems instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very similar,</v>

54
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>but they're not that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't find them in nature.</v>

55
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.670
<v Speaker 1>So all this makes me think that it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable that someone could create</v>

56
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>something akin to these primordial</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere,</v>

57
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>primordial condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on earth experiments that would</v>

58
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>make molecules that replicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

59
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 1>And we would find that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there is a common ancestor to both</v>

60
00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>viruses and bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

61
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Would that molecule be dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be like a super virus or the</v>

62
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:23.820
<v Speaker 1>super bacteria?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>intuitively I don't think so cause we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all here.</v>

64
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all,</v>

65
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened and we,</v>

66
00:04:29.651 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>it didn't kill us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

67
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:34.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you'll be the guy that figures out</v>

68
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>the early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>early Miller and the next step,</v>

69
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.110
<v Speaker 1>the next step of early Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next step of self replicating</v>

70
00:04:41.111 --> 00:04:46.111
<v Speaker 1>molecules with primordial components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a very compelling idea.</v>

71
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Keep us posted.</v>
