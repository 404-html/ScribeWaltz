1
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>What is the best sort of life for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human being?</v>

2
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Socrates claimed in 400 BC that a man</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives a happier life if he's just,</v>

3
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>even if he's thrown starving into prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the rest of his life,</v>

4
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 1>then if he's unjust and he celebrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honored all of his days and his</v>

5
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>never caught for his crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could that possibly be correct?</v>

6
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>If not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

7
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 1>And what difference should the question</v>
<v Speaker 1>make to us?</v>

8
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What moves the human heart?</v>

9
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's characters throw us into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depths of lust,</v>

10
00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>envy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greed,</v>

11
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambition.</v>

12
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 1>What are those characters have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way that we act or that we</v>

13
00:01:02.891 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>behave or that we believe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if so,</v>

14
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>what difference would it make to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them in Shakespeare?</v>

15
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Why Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is Elizabeth and English is very</v>

16
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:18.541
<v Speaker 1>difficult for us who speak moderating</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to understand Thomas Hobbs road in</v>

17
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:24.151
<v Speaker 1>1651 a book called Leviathan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the two or three most influential</v>

18
00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:30.871
<v Speaker 1>works in the history of thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and politics in Western</v>

19
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was writing from the midst of a</v>

20
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:39.811
<v Speaker 1>raging civil war and he argued that</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless we gave all the power,</v>

21
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>unless we surrendered all ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>control to a legitimate king,</v>

22
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.390
<v Speaker 1>that we would all rob and kill each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

23
00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Was He right about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the way things actually work and</v>

24
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>is the question relevant to us today</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we no longer believe in kings?</v>

25
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Jeff Brenzel and I'm the dean</v>

26
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:07.960
<v Speaker 1>of undergraduate admissions at Yale</v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

27
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>I lecture from time to time in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy department at Yale and my</v>

28
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:19.901
<v Speaker 1>work in philosophy centers around ethics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also the history of the ideas that</v>

29
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>we've had about something we'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>call human nature.</v>

30
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.730
<v Speaker 1>Speaking of human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my personal heroes,</v>

31
00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 1>aristotle claimed that by nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone seeks to know everyone desires</v>

32
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the purposes of this talk,</v>

33
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to assume that you are already</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intellectually curious person and</v>

34
00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>that you're not only chasing after</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge as hard as you can.</v>

35
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.090
<v Speaker 1>You're also trying to build up the skill</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets and acquire the kind of capacities</v>

36
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:56.620
<v Speaker 1>and abilities that you're going to need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become a better learner overall.</v>

37
00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.920
<v Speaker 1>If these things are in fact about you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then here's my advice in a nutshell.</v>

38
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Make a choice in college to read some</v>
<v Speaker 1>old books,</v>

39
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:19.110
<v Speaker 1>even a substantial number of old books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My argument will be that reading the</v>

40
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:25.831
<v Speaker 1>right old books in the right way is</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than reading only new books,</v>

41
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>much less using only new ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning that have nothing to do with</v>

42
00:03:31.661 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>books at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's be careful about what I'm</v>

43
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>claiming and what I'm not claiming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not claiming that you should read</v>

44
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>only all books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>or that old books are better because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're old.</v>

46
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that you should never read any new</v>

47
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:54.061
<v Speaker 1>books or that new books are worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only that you should read and learn how</v>

48
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:59.491
<v Speaker 1>to read some old books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which ones would those be?</v>

49
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>How do you learn how to read them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right way?</v>

50
00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Why should you read them in college and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could doing that change your life</v>

51
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:10.444
<v Speaker 1>for the better?</v>

52
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.200
<v Speaker 1>How is that going to make you smarter?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Moreover,</v>

53
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>how's it going to make you wiser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dialogues of socrates,</v>

54
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle's ethics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oedipus rex,</v>

55
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the city of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leviathan,</v>

56
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Dante's inferno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Lear,</v>

57
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Paradise Lost Warren piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of these books,</v>

58
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>but why spend a significant amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your time on books that by definition</v>

59
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>are outdated?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not go after the books that bring</v>

60
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>everything up to date?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't we know everything those people</v>

61
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>already knew and much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more.</v>

62
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.780
<v Speaker 1>So a little personal background here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went off to university in 1971 no one</v>

63
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:05.110
<v Speaker 1>in my family had ever graduated from</v>
<v Speaker 1>college,</v>

64
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>much less a place like Yale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never visited across the state</v>

65
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never reviewed,</v>

66
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:17.130
<v Speaker 1>had even been on an airplane before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that swept me off to uh,</v>

67
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>to new haven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>

68
00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Now when I actually showed up at Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I applied in total ignorance and almost</v>

69
00:05:25.031 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>by accident to a special freshman year</v>
<v Speaker 1>program called directed studies.</v>

70
00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>So what is directed studies and directed</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies?</v>

71
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:38.881
<v Speaker 1>You take three full year courses in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of Western thought and</v>

72
00:05:39.221 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and literature and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

73
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.080
<v Speaker 1>you start with what the classic Greeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to say,</v>

74
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>and then you roll forward with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries until you end up about a</v>

75
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>century behind where we are right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no textbooks,</v>

76
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>there's no summaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no cliff notes.</v>

77
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>You read only the original works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was both the single most</v>

78
00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>difficult and the single most</v>
<v Speaker 1>transforming educational experience that</v>

79
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>About 15 years ago,</v>

80
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I came back to Yale after founding</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies managing organizations,</v>

81
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and after earning a phd in philosophy.</v>

82
00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:27.670
<v Speaker 1>And I'm having the opportunity there</v>
<v Speaker 1>today to teach in this very same program</v>

83
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>that I took over 30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've gotten to know these classic</v>

84
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>works fairly well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have become familiar with them.</v>

85
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen their effects on students,</v>

86
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've had the chance to stack them up</v>

87
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>against my own life experience and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've read from lots of modern</v>

88
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here I am ready to give you some good</v>

89
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:55.190
<v Speaker 1>reasons to look into the classics</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

90
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing to point out is</v>

91
00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>something that I think you already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of books out there and</v>

92
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't have much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Library of Congress has over 20</v>

93
00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.310
<v Speaker 1>million volumes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the largest library in the world.</v>

94
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>That's not counting the journals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the publications.</v>

95
00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not counting the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not counting the blogs.</v>

96
00:07:21.721 --> 00:07:25.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not counting with wikipedia is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>counting the entire Google plex.</v>

97
00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down here on the personal level,</v>

98
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm 58 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been a pretty strong reader for</v>

99
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:34.470
<v Speaker 1>about 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:07:34.471 --> 00:07:36.930
<v Speaker 1>back home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a personal library of about</v>

101
00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:38.940
<v Speaker 1>2000 books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>volumes.</v>

102
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 1>And if you do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about 50 books times 40 years,</v>

103
00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.070
<v Speaker 1>50 books a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about a book a week.</v>

104
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:51.510
<v Speaker 1>I hope you can see the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My problem,</v>

105
00:07:51.511 --> 00:07:55.950
<v Speaker 1>which is also your problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is we ain't gonna make it through</v>

106
00:07:55.951 --> 00:07:57.420
<v Speaker 1>the library of Congress.</v>

107
00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:03.410
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to get to 99.99,</v>

108
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.690
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>9% of everything that's ever been</v>

109
00:08:06.691 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>written.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Mahatma Gandhi said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>live as though you'll die tomorrow,</v>

111
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:19.070
<v Speaker 1>but learn as though you'll live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gandhi was as aware as you and I are</v>

112
00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.330
<v Speaker 1>that we're not going to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

113
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means that you are going to have to</v>

114
00:08:27.811 --> 00:08:31.590
<v Speaker 1>be extremely picky about what you choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to read.</v>

115
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Even if you live according to Gandhi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you literally have no other choice.</v>

116
00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:44.010
<v Speaker 1>But now it seems I've only made my job</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder because I've got to persuade you</v>

117
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:48.000
<v Speaker 1>that with this precious time that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have for learning and study,</v>

118
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>which is dwindling all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to take some of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>devote it to things that are.</v>

120
00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's focus on the principle of</v>

121
00:09:00.121 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means the principle of having</v>

122
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>to make these difficult and time</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming choices.</v>

123
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to give you five reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five rough and ready criteria for</v>

124
00:09:18.401 --> 00:09:23.401
<v Speaker 1>identifying a classic of literature or</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy or politics.</v>

125
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one or two of these criteria are</v>

126
00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:28.420
<v Speaker 1>going to be decisive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think if you put them all</v>

127
00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:30.640
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to prove actually to be</v>

128
00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:35.641
<v Speaker 1>quite useful first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The work addresses a permanent universal</v>

129
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:40.270
<v Speaker 1>concern about the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the philosophical perspective,</v>

130
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.070
<v Speaker 1>it has something to say about the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>should live from a literary perspective.</v>

131
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>It helps us imagine different ways that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could live and from a political</v>

132
00:09:50.771 --> 00:09:53.920
<v Speaker 1>perspective or an historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

133
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>it helps us remember ways that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived.</v>

134
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:00.970
<v Speaker 1>So that's Martin number one of a classic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin.</v>

135
00:10:00.971 --> 00:10:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Number two is that the work has been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>game changer.</v>

136
00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>It changed perspective or shifted</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on those issues both for the</v>

137
00:10:10.181 --> 00:10:14.740
<v Speaker 1>earliest people who read the book and</v>
<v Speaker 1>also for those who came later.</v>

138
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number three is that the work has</v>

139
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 1>stimulated or provoked or responded to</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other important works.</v>

140
00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.210
<v Speaker 1>Martin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number four is that many generations of</v>

141
00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the very best readers and the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>expert critics have rated the work</v>

142
00:10:32.861 --> 00:10:36.040
<v Speaker 1>highly is one of the best and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important of its kind.</v>

143
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Even if those reviewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those experts didn't agree on anything</v>

144
00:10:41.501 --> 00:10:46.420
<v Speaker 1>else and even if they took our head a</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent argument with the work itself.</v>

145
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number five is that the work usually</v>

146
00:10:49.451 --> 00:10:54.451
<v Speaker 1>does require a strenuous effort to both</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage it and understand it.</v>

147
00:10:55.090 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>But rewards that great effort in</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple ways and very highly.</v>

148
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Before we think about what these</v>
<v Speaker 1>criteria rule in,</v>

149
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>let's think about what they rule out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you run up to me with a</v>

150
00:11:13.321 --> 00:11:18.210
<v Speaker 1>novel that you picked up just last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You waving in the air and you say,</v>

151
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.330
<v Speaker 1>Professor Brenzel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a great book here for you.</v>

152
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It's an instant classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even better than Moby Dick,</v>

153
00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 1>maybe even better than moby Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What am I likely to respond?</v>

154
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be in fact very good and your</v>

155
00:11:34.291 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 1>recommendation may persuade me to read</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

156
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:40.320
<v Speaker 1>particularly if I have a high opinion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you as an expert reader.</v>

157
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Your new favorite book May in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a classic someday,</v>

158
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.500
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't changed.</v>

159
00:11:49.501 --> 00:11:52.020
<v Speaker 1>The game is yet for other writers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>readers,</v>

160
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.140
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't provoked or influenced lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other works.</v>

161
00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>How could it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how experts and other</v>

162
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 1>readers are going to evaluate it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

163
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.400
<v Speaker 1>You're not even sure how you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the book over time,</v>

164
00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but let's remember the critical problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we all have way too many books and</v>

165
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:14.890
<v Speaker 1>not nearly enough time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

166
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>where are you likely to get the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>bang for your reading dollar and for</v>

167
00:12:19.631 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 1>your reading hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something published last week or</v>

168
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:28.621
<v Speaker 1>something that stood the centuries of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests by tough readers and that has in</v>

169
00:12:28.691 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>fact spawned a great deal of what you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>be reading today.</v>

170
00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:35.950
<v Speaker 1>So I'm sort of defining a classic as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>old book.</v>

171
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.770
<v Speaker 1>It's been through generations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>readers,</v>

172
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:40.960
<v Speaker 1>big game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing ideas,</v>

173
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something that you can expect to</v>

174
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:46.090
<v Speaker 1>find to be a considerable challenge to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tackle.</v>

175
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.540
<v Speaker 1>So let's flush it out with just a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>

176
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:51.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we talk about what good it's</v>

177
00:12:51.821 --> 00:12:54.190
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You to read such a book in a college</v>

178
00:12:54.191 --> 00:12:55.024
<v Speaker 1>course.</v>

179
00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Socrates was a philosopher who lived in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Athens,</v>

180
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:08.580
<v Speaker 1>ancient Greece about 400 years before</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birth of Christ.</v>

181
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.810
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you know nothing else about him,</v>

182
00:13:12.811 --> 00:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you may also know that the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens of Athens put him to death.</v>

183
00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he went around asking a lot of</v>

184
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:22.350
<v Speaker 1>challenging questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needling people,</v>

185
00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:23.540
<v Speaker 1>irritating them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.730
<v Speaker 1>with questions about their actions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their beliefs that they didn't care to</v>

187
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:28.080
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

188
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:31.680
<v Speaker 1>it's a remarkable fact that for the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 centuries,</v>

189
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:37.190
<v Speaker 1>very few thinkers in the western</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition have been able to avoid having</v>

190
00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:41.280
<v Speaker 1>to come at some point to grips with</v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates and his life and his death.</v>

191
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.790
<v Speaker 1>It's even more interesting that</v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates,</v>

192
00:13:44.791 --> 00:13:48.600
<v Speaker 1>so far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never actually wrote down a single word.</v>

193
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.530
<v Speaker 1>He strolled around the town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

194
00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.390
<v Speaker 1>embarrassing prominent people with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

195
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.330
<v Speaker 1>He liked to say that the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>superiority that he ever claimed was</v>

196
00:14:00.331 --> 00:14:03.350
<v Speaker 1>that he was absolutely certain that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was ignorant,</v>

197
00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:08.010
<v Speaker 1>but he found that people believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they knew all kinds of things and in</v>

198
00:14:08.011 --> 00:14:10.050
<v Speaker 1>that he was superior to them.</v>

199
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the young aristocrats who got a</v>

200
00:14:13.441 --> 00:14:15.190
<v Speaker 1>big charge out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

201
00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:20.270
<v Speaker 1>following socrates around the town was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young wrestler named Plato,</v>

202
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe the first scholar athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Plato wrote a series of dialogues</v>

203
00:14:27.121 --> 00:14:32.121
<v Speaker 1>after socrates died that featured his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hero and the principal role,</v>

204
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:34.980
<v Speaker 1>the early dialogues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:14:34.981 --> 00:14:39.981
<v Speaker 1>do seem to reflect for us this business</v>
<v Speaker 1>of walking around asking these difficult</v>

206
00:14:40.261 --> 00:14:44.670
<v Speaker 1>questions that no one can answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later in the later dialogues,</v>

207
00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Plato begins to use socrates as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpiece or as someone who represents</v>

208
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of new questions that plato</v>
<v Speaker 1>himself began to ask under socrates</v>

209
00:14:56.601 --> 00:15:01.601
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to give me some indication</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how expert readers over time have</v>

210
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>understood Plato's thought and its</v>
<v Speaker 1>central importance in the tradition.</v>

211
00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 1>The great 20th century philosopher and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematician Alfred North Whitehead</v>

212
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:17.530
<v Speaker 1>once said that all of western thought is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than a series of footnotes</v>

213
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.900
<v Speaker 1>to Plato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite a claim and remember that it was</v>

214
00:15:23.901 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Plato's encounter was socrates that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired all of Plato's thought.</v>

215
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato's single most important dialogue</v>

216
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
<v Speaker 1>with socrates is the hero is a dialog</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the republic.</v>

217
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.140
<v Speaker 1>And in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato tries to formulate to basic</v>

218
00:15:42.141 --> 00:15:46.250
<v Speaker 1>fundamental and universal questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the best sort of life for a human</v>

219
00:15:46.251 --> 00:15:48.350
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And beyond that,</v>

220
00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:53.380
<v Speaker 1>what's the best society for producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conditions under which human beings</v>

221
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.340
<v Speaker 1>could live that kind of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two questions give the book the</v>

222
00:15:58.341 --> 00:16:01.500
<v Speaker 1>first mark of greatness that I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

223
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:05.840
<v Speaker 1>that I was discussing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the republic addresses</v>

224
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>permanent and universal questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ones that might puzzle you as much as</v>

225
00:16:11.181 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 1>they did socrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Plato.</v>

226
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>The book opens with a really terrific</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument about justice,</v>

227
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the just or the unjust</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who gets the better of it in</v>

228
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:30.950
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Software confronts a very sarcastic and</v>

229
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:35.150
<v Speaker 1>very aggressive young man named</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] who attacks the common</v>

230
00:16:35.151 --> 00:16:40.151
<v Speaker 1>notion that justice is a virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen then says through civicus I</v>

231
00:16:40.431 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 1>proclaim that might is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that justice,</v>

232
00:16:44.481 --> 00:16:47.180
<v Speaker 1>as you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is whatever happens to be in the</v>

233
00:16:47.181 --> 00:16:51.050
<v Speaker 1>interest of the stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different forms of government,</v>

234
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:54.860
<v Speaker 1>but they all make laws according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own interests.</v>

235
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is only one principle of so called</v>

236
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.350
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that justice turns out to be</v>

237
00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:08.000
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens to be in the interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the stronger.</v>

238
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.140
<v Speaker 1>So have you ever heard someone make this</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument before?</v>

239
00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.990
<v Speaker 1>That might makes right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The justice has no fixed meaning that</v>

240
00:17:17.991 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 1>what is considered just in a society is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just whatever the people running the</v>

241
00:17:22.281 --> 00:17:23.840
<v Speaker 1>society say it is.</v>

242
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:28.730
<v Speaker 1>I'd be surprised if you hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a universally recurring</v>

243
00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:32.270
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only throughout the dorms have any</v>

244
00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:35.200
<v Speaker 1>good colleges down through time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

245
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.780
<v Speaker 1>but also down through the centuries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the debates of the very best</v>

246
00:17:38.781 --> 00:17:43.010
<v Speaker 1>philosophers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I can't do justice in this short</v>

247
00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:48.011
<v Speaker 1>talk to even this relatively simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening framing argument of the republic</v>

248
00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:54.250
<v Speaker 1>for Simica Socrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But essentially socrates tries to answer</v>

249
00:17:54.251 --> 00:17:59.251
<v Speaker 1>it through civicus by pointing out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we distinguished between good rulers and</v>

250
00:17:59.521 --> 00:18:02.280
<v Speaker 1>bad rulers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just like we distinguish between good</v>

251
00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:06.990
<v Speaker 1>shepherds and bad shepherds or good boat</v>
<v Speaker 1>captains and bad boat captains.</v>

252
00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.950
<v Speaker 1>The good shepherds act in the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>interests of the sheep and the good boat</v>

253
00:18:13.141 --> 00:18:16.320
<v Speaker 1>captains act in the best interest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their boats and passengers.</v>

254
00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 1>So a ruler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's right,</v>

255
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:21.480
<v Speaker 1>we named a ruler or she's rightly named</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ruler,</v>

256
00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:26.810
<v Speaker 1>is someone who acts in the best interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the subjects and the bad ones don't</v>

257
00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Speaker 1>throw synagis calls this drivel.</v>

258
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.780
<v Speaker 1>He points out that the shepherd hardly</v>
<v Speaker 1>cares for the sheep.</v>

259
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>He simply fattening them for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>slaughter.</v>

260
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Consider further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most foolish socrates.</v>

261
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:49.191
<v Speaker 1>He says that the just is always a loser</v>
<v Speaker 1>and comparison with the unjust.</v>

262
00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.150
<v Speaker 1>First of all in private matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the unjust is the partner of</v>

263
00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:56.760
<v Speaker 1>the just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will find that the unjust man always</v>

264
00:18:56.761 --> 00:18:59.910
<v Speaker 1>gains more and the just man always gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>

265
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Next in their dealings with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government when there is an income tax,</v>

266
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:09.060
<v Speaker 1>the just man will pay more and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unjust man less on the same amount of</v>

267
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:11.910
<v Speaker 1>income and when there is anything to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>received,</v>

268
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the one gains nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other gains much</v>

269
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.470
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

270
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:25.470
<v Speaker 1>By this standard for semigloss goes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say the best life is actually the one</v>

271
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:30.751
<v Speaker 1>to be had by the absolute tyrant who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>take anything that he wishes by force</v>

272
00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:35.560
<v Speaker 1>and make everyone else pay honor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>obedience.</v>

273
00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.300
<v Speaker 1>So not only is being a tyrant the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of life,</v>

274
00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:44.640
<v Speaker 1>all people would become tyrants if only</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could know.</v>

275
00:19:44.641 --> 00:19:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Socrates at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knox through simic is down with some</v>

276
00:19:48.791 --> 00:19:52.690
<v Speaker 1>verbal and logical tricks that I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to take you through in this talk</v>

277
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:57.010
<v Speaker 1>and outwitted through Simica stocks off</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the conversation,</v>

278
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:58.000
<v Speaker 1>not to return.</v>

279
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:05.690
<v Speaker 1>The young friends of socrates are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied with this outcome.</v>

280
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.320
<v Speaker 1>And they take up the core question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a much harder for them.</v>

281
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:15.430
<v Speaker 1>They asked socrates to prove to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the just person is always happier</v>

282
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:19.670
<v Speaker 1>and always has a better life than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unjust person.</v>

283
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.460
<v Speaker 1>No matter how poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deprived,</v>

284
00:20:22.461 --> 00:20:25.520
<v Speaker 1>disgraced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reviled the just man might be.</v>

285
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And no matter how wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honored,</v>

286
00:20:28.131 --> 00:20:32.090
<v Speaker 1>and completely unharmed an unjust man</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be.</v>

287
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.780
<v Speaker 1>So the rest of the republic is Plato is</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to answer this question along</v>

288
00:20:38.481 --> 00:20:41.870
<v Speaker 1>with a number of other questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the course of it,</v>

289
00:20:41.871 --> 00:20:45.680
<v Speaker 1>he draws a surprisingly compelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of human psychology.</v>

290
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.910
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the nature of knowledge,</v>

291
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.740
<v Speaker 1>he presents a proposal for the ideal</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and he polishes it all off with a</v>

292
00:20:53.741 --> 00:20:57.370
<v Speaker 1>theory about enlightenment and about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate nature of reality.</v>

293
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he speculates about the relations</v>

294
00:21:00.161 --> 00:21:04.090
<v Speaker 1>between men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to raise and educate children to be</v>

295
00:21:04.091 --> 00:21:09.091
<v Speaker 1>good citizens and the right way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings to investigate questions of</v>

296
00:21:09.251 --> 00:21:10.084
<v Speaker 1>all kinds.</v>

297
00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato himself had a brilliant student</v>

298
00:21:12.491 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 1>named aristotle who for my money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

299
00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:18.400
<v Speaker 1>actually surpass plato and a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways,</v>

300
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:20.980
<v Speaker 1>but was certainly heavily influenced by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato.</v>

301
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.110
<v Speaker 1>So let me just give you a very quick</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of how things play out and the</v>

302
00:21:26.111 --> 00:21:30.580
<v Speaker 1>history of thought for Plato's and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle's thinking and in fact,</v>

303
00:21:30.581 --> 00:21:35.581
<v Speaker 1>for your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

304
00:21:37.391 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>they're thinking stays very much alive</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Greece,</v>

305
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:44.911
<v Speaker 1>in Rome for 400 years until the coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Christ and beyond that for many</v>

306
00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.660
<v Speaker 1>centuries more if you happen to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian,</v>

307
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.060
<v Speaker 1>what you think of is Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very concepts and ideas that form</v>

308
00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:59.530
<v Speaker 1>the basis for Christianity actually turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to owe a great deal to plato and</v>

309
00:21:59.531 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virtually everything that Christianity</v>

310
00:22:02.711 --> 00:22:05.860
<v Speaker 1>teaches about God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about human nature,</v>

311
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.920
<v Speaker 1>about human fulfillment arises from what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the historians of religion like to call</v>

312
00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 1>the marriage of Jerusalem and Athens.</v>

313
00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:17.410
<v Speaker 1>That is the marriage of Greek and Jewish</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

314
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:23.070
<v Speaker 1>One big moment for this process comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>about eighth centuries after Plato and</v>

315
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:30.040
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle for centuries after Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a man named Saint Augustan writes a</v>

316
00:22:30.041 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 1>truly monumental work in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Western thought.</v>

317
00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.920
<v Speaker 1>A real classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city of God.</v>

318
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:41.430
<v Speaker 1>He writes this book just as the Roman</v>
<v Speaker 1>Empire is collapsing around his ears</v>

319
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.500
<v Speaker 1>from invasions of barbarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Augustan was very influenced by platonic</v>

320
00:22:48.251 --> 00:22:51.430
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though he wasn't all that familiar</v>

321
00:22:51.431 --> 00:22:55.510
<v Speaker 1>directly with Plato's works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he sets the course of Christian</v>

322
00:22:55.511 --> 00:22:58.360
<v Speaker 1>thinking for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

323
00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.600
<v Speaker 1>if you're knowledgeable about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of Christian doctrine or</v>

324
00:23:01.601 --> 00:23:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Christian theology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

325
00:23:03.221 --> 00:23:07.090
<v Speaker 1>you'll know that augustine is</v>
<v Speaker 1>influential right up to the current</v>

326
00:23:07.091 --> 00:23:12.091
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then another 800 years after Sandy</v>

327
00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Gustin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a priest around the year 1215 named</v>

328
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:21.870
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Aquinas rediscovers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the last works of Aristotle.</v>

329
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.760
<v Speaker 1>To put this very briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he puts together the thought of</v>

330
00:23:27.761 --> 00:23:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle with the thought of Augustan</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes up with a new synthesis for</v>

331
00:23:32.531 --> 00:23:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Christian thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out to be a game changer.</v>

332
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 1>The result is for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Roman Catholic Church teaches</v>

333
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:44.500
<v Speaker 1>to this very day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saint Thomas Aquinas,</v>

334
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the primary Orthodox theologian of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholicism.</v>

335
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italian poet,</v>

336
00:23:51.801 --> 00:23:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Dante,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who lives one generation after aquinas</v>

337
00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.900
<v Speaker 1>reads aquinas is influenced by his work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as one of the three or four greatest</v>

338
00:24:03.081 --> 00:24:08.081
<v Speaker 1>poets ever to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presents us with his own view of human</v>

339
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:09.590
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfillment,</v>

340
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.730
<v Speaker 1>and human destiny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he writes his three epic poems</v>

341
00:24:13.731 --> 00:24:15.980
<v Speaker 1>about Hell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purgatory and heaven,</v>

342
00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:18.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably heard of Dante's</v>

343
00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 1>inferno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now fast forward another 250 years</v>

344
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:28.790
<v Speaker 1>and we come to about the year 1500</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther in Germany.</v>

345
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luther gets very angry about a lot of</v>

346
00:24:32.511 --> 00:24:34.670
<v Speaker 1>things that are happening in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic church.</v>

347
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.180
<v Speaker 1>He goes back and rips aquinas apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He trashes aristotle and he returns for</v>

348
00:24:41.601 --> 00:24:46.601
<v Speaker 1>his inspiration to the game changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>works of Saint Augustine and Saint Paul.</v>

349
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.320
<v Speaker 1>By doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luther also starts a process that</v>

350
00:24:52.321 --> 00:24:55.490
<v Speaker 1>splitters Christianity into a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

351
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:57.703
<v Speaker 1>game changers.</v>

352
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Another hundred or so years after</v>
<v Speaker 1>luther,</v>

353
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.040
<v Speaker 1>we have John Milton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton is an English poet.</v>

354
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.050
<v Speaker 1>He takes his inspiration from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reforming of Christianity,</v>

355
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:16.130
<v Speaker 1>the Protestant reformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he writes the greatest epic poem in</v>

356
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:18.830
<v Speaker 1>the English language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise lost.</v>

357
00:25:19.220 --> 00:25:23.510
<v Speaker 1>It gives his own picture of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestant picture of human nature,</v>

358
00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.030
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human destiny,</v>

359
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:30.620
<v Speaker 1>God's will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you happen to be a Catholic and</v>

360
00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:35.360
<v Speaker 1>you believe that the Catholic Church</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaches the same thing always in</v>

361
00:25:35.361 --> 00:25:37.940
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and has from the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

362
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:43.690
<v Speaker 1>or if you're an evangelical Protestant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you believe that all of your own</v>

363
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:49.450
<v Speaker 1>views come directly from a plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a straight forward reading of New</v>

364
00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Testament texts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In either case,</v>

365
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you could not be more mistaken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very teachings of the Catholic</v>

366
00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Church or the very ways that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestant Christian interprets the</v>

367
00:26:00.621 --> 00:26:05.621
<v Speaker 1>words of the Bible and scripture results</v>
<v Speaker 1>from speculations and collisions taking</v>

368
00:26:06.981 --> 00:26:11.780
<v Speaker 1>place among ideas that involve plato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>

369
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Augustan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aquinas,</v>

370
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:16.640
<v Speaker 1>St Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dante,</v>

371
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Milton.</v>

372
00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's a very small example of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite specific.</v>

373
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Many Christians believe that Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil,</v>

374
00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:31.670
<v Speaker 1>was once a great arcane joe in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was the highest of all the</v>

375
00:26:31.671 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 1>angels and that his name was Lucifer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he rebelled against God in</v>

376
00:26:36.591 --> 00:26:39.500
<v Speaker 1>heaven before the creation of the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

377
00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 1>Later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he successfully tempted our first</v>

378
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:45.810
<v Speaker 1>parents and Adam and eve to eat an apple</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garden of Eden.</v>

379
00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:51.260
<v Speaker 1>There's actually remarkably little in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hebrew scriptures about Satan and</v>

380
00:26:51.631 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 1>what's there does not happen to include</v>
<v Speaker 1>these beliefs.</v>

381
00:26:55.370 --> 00:27:00.000
<v Speaker 1>The same as we imagine him is actually a</v>
<v Speaker 1>much later invention.</v>

382
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:05.210
<v Speaker 1>And he's not thought of as either a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen angel or even fully identify with</v>

383
00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:11.061
<v Speaker 1>the serpent in the garden who tempt Adam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eve to taste the fruit until four</v>

384
00:27:11.581 --> 00:27:16.581
<v Speaker 1>centuries after the life of Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Augustan has a lot to do with who Satan</v>

385
00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:22.620
<v Speaker 1>becomes and the picture that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself may have in your mind of a</v>

386
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:26.310
<v Speaker 1>rebel angel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war in heaven between the good angels</v>

387
00:27:26.311 --> 00:27:27.900
<v Speaker 1>and the bad angels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

388
00:27:27.901 --> 00:27:32.250
<v Speaker 1>that's something that John Melton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine for us when he published</v>

389
00:27:32.251 --> 00:27:35.190
<v Speaker 1>paradise loss in 1667,</v>

390
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:46.120
<v Speaker 1>socrates and Plato and aristotle exert</v>
<v Speaker 1>influences in many other threads or</v>

391
00:27:48.681 --> 00:27:52.670
<v Speaker 1>conversations or discussions that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking place in the western history of</v>

392
00:27:52.671 --> 00:27:54.260
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

393
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:59.470
<v Speaker 1>the encounter was socrates enters very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly into soren kierkegaard is work</v>

394
00:27:59.931 --> 00:28:03.350
<v Speaker 1>in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kierkegaard is the Godfather of</v>

395
00:28:03.351 --> 00:28:05.140
<v Speaker 1>existentialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

396
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.800
<v Speaker 1>ultimately kierkegaard produces all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other philosophers like heidegger</v>

397
00:28:09.801 --> 00:28:14.801
<v Speaker 1>and Sartre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Socrates also provoked and gave shape.</v>

398
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:17.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an encounter,</v>

399
00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.970
<v Speaker 1>a philosophical encounter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

400
00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
<v Speaker 1>gave shape to Friedrich Nietzsche's</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought also in the 19th century as</v>

401
00:28:25.011 --> 00:28:30.011
<v Speaker 1>Nietzsche actually seeks to try to undo</v>
<v Speaker 1>a what he considers to be the disaster</v>

402
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.580
<v Speaker 1>that socrates has bequeath to Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

403
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.000
<v Speaker 1>So you simply cannot study the history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of western thought without running into</v>

404
00:28:41.031 --> 00:28:44.660
<v Speaker 1>Plato and socrates just around about</v>
<v Speaker 1>every corner.</v>

405
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:47.680
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

406
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:52.190
<v Speaker 1>read a thinker who hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced himself or herself by these</v>

407
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:56.030
<v Speaker 1>ideas in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the way that they actually</v>

408
00:28:56.031 --> 00:28:57.710
<v Speaker 1>pose the original questions.</v>

409
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.140
<v Speaker 1>What's the best sort of life for human</v>
<v Speaker 1>being?</v>

410
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the best kind of society in</v>

411
00:29:03.831 --> 00:29:08.420
<v Speaker 1>which that sort of life can be lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the republic is still what I would</v>

412
00:29:08.421 --> 00:29:12.740
<v Speaker 1>call a living book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still fuels and counters.</v>

413
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:15.740
<v Speaker 1>It's still provokes us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provokes,</v>

414
00:29:15.990 --> 00:29:18.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>students in my classroom.</v>

415
00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.810
<v Speaker 1>I think just as much as socrates</v>
<v Speaker 1>provoked them,</v>

416
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the streets of ancient Greece.</v>

417
00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has something to teach us.</v>

418
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.330
<v Speaker 1>It has something to connect us very</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply to the ideas of many others.</v>

419
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that's made our society</v>

420
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:37.330
<v Speaker 1>in some very deep respects what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might say that Plato,</v>

421
00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:39.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his inspiration,</v>

422
00:29:39.941 --> 00:29:42.280
<v Speaker 1>soccer teas are the opposite</v>

423
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:44.350
<v Speaker 3>of outdated thinkers</v>

424
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.540
<v Speaker 3>on this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

425
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.640
<v Speaker 3>rather a quick dash through the</v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries.</v>

426
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.480
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've not forgotten the question that I'm</v>

427
00:29:57.481 --> 00:29:59.940
<v Speaker 3>supposed to answer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>

428
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 3>so what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does it do you any good to know</v>

429
00:30:03.991 --> 00:30:08.170
<v Speaker 3>these things?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's all this about strenuous effort</v>

430
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.050
<v Speaker 3>and what's that got to do with something</v>
<v Speaker 3>being a classic?</v>

431
00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Aren't there any classics that are easy</v>
<v Speaker 3>to read,</v>

432
00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to cut to the chase and regarding all</v>

433
00:30:17.211 --> 00:30:21.340
<v Speaker 3>of the strenuous effort?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do I really have to dig in to</v>

434
00:30:21.341 --> 00:30:25.420
<v Speaker 3>Plato's Republic at all?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I just hear about it from you?</v>

435
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Or why can't I read the cliff notes</v>
<v Speaker 3>version?</v>

436
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.650
<v Speaker 3>Or why can't I find a summary or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>digest or look on my neighbor's notes?</v>

437
00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why won't wikipedia tell me everything</v>

438
00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.700
<v Speaker 3>that is truly important for me to take</v>
<v Speaker 3>away from the book?</v>

439
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Why can't I take the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take advantage of the fact that all</v>

440
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:47.530
<v Speaker 3>these other people have read it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>commented on it and used it for some</v>

441
00:30:47.531 --> 00:30:49.960
<v Speaker 3>purpose or another?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the takeaway?</v>

442
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 20th century philosopher and critic</v>

443
00:30:53.471 --> 00:30:55.210
<v Speaker 3>Mortimer Adler,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

444
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.050
<v Speaker 3>put it this way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the path of true learning is strewn with</v>

445
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:01.270
<v Speaker 3>rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not roses,</v>

446
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:06.460
<v Speaker 3>but I am still saying he goes on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great books can be read by every</v>

447
00:31:06.461 --> 00:31:08.680
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In one sense.</v>

448
00:31:08.681 --> 00:31:11.110
<v Speaker 3>Of course they are the most difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 3>read,</v>

449
00:31:11.470 --> 00:31:16.470
<v Speaker 3>but they are in another sense the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>readable both for the less and the more</v>

450
00:31:17.171 --> 00:31:21.490
<v Speaker 3>competent reader because they are the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most instructive.</v>

451
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:23.940
<v Speaker 3>What Adler is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

452
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 3>is trying to tell us here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

453
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:31.950
<v Speaker 3>is that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just because something is difficult</v>

454
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:36.610
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean that the time you spend</v>
<v Speaker 3>with it is not worthwhile.</v>

455
00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.380
<v Speaker 3>And in fact that any amount of time that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you spend with one of these kinds of</v>

456
00:31:41.381 --> 00:31:46.381
<v Speaker 3>works will actually be more valuable to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you then the same amount of time that</v>

457
00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:49.210
<v Speaker 3>you spend on homework of lesser quality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

458
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:53.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what Adler wants us to understand a is</v>

459
00:31:53.081 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 3>the principle of no pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no gain.</v>

460
00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.340
<v Speaker 3>And in fact that in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

461
00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.120
<v Speaker 3>works of the mind that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

462
00:32:01.121 --> 00:32:05.050
<v Speaker 3>whatever the pain you experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever time and study that you're</v>

463
00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:08.920
<v Speaker 3>going to give to these works,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these works pay a greater return.</v>

464
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:10.960
<v Speaker 3>You might say they have a higher</v>
<v Speaker 3>interest rate,</v>

465
00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then the ordinary stocks and bonds that</v>

466
00:32:13.901 --> 00:32:16.120
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be exposed to and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>rest of your courses.</v>

467
00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:24.640
<v Speaker 3>So what I'm going to do now is to try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>give you five takeaways,</v>

468
00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is five valuable things that are</v>

469
00:32:29.231 --> 00:32:31.300
<v Speaker 3>specific to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

470
00:32:31.330 --> 00:32:36.330
<v Speaker 3>that you can pull out of these books and</v>
<v Speaker 3>take away with you to the other things</v>

471
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:39.440
<v Speaker 3>that you're studying and also to your</v>
<v Speaker 3>own life.</v>

472
00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the value of forgotten ideas.</v>

473
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.920
<v Speaker 3>Some old ideas are not actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>outdated.</v>

474
00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:54.050
<v Speaker 3>The entire period that we call the</v>
<v Speaker 3>European renaissance actually consisted</v>

475
00:32:54.051 --> 00:32:58.910
<v Speaker 3>of people rediscovering a bunch of ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the ancient world and giving them a</v>

476
00:32:58.911 --> 00:33:03.440
<v Speaker 3>new application.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So point number one is some of these old</v>

477
00:33:03.441 --> 00:33:06.260
<v Speaker 3>ideas are actually valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Number two,</v>

478
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:09.740
<v Speaker 3>the value of making connections between</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas.</v>

479
00:33:10.370 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 3>There is less new under the sun than</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you might think.</v>

480
00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:19.030
<v Speaker 3>And seeing the connections that tie one</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinker to another in a tradition,</v>

481
00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:24.050
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>also gives you a measure of how far</v>

482
00:33:24.051 --> 00:33:29.051
<v Speaker 3>we've come on some problems and what</v>
<v Speaker 3>problems seem to have heavily resisted,</v>

483
00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the attempts of human beings to give</v>

484
00:33:32.511 --> 00:33:33.344
<v Speaker 3>them answers.</v>

485
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that we've been considering from</v>

486
00:33:36.411 --> 00:33:38.810
<v Speaker 3>time to time through the course of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>talk is one of those,</v>

487
00:33:38.811 --> 00:33:41.060
<v Speaker 3>what's the best sort of life for a human</v>
<v Speaker 3>being?</v>

488
00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.350
<v Speaker 3>This is a question that you'll be asking</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself as you try to figure out things</v>

489
00:33:45.351 --> 00:33:48.050
<v Speaker 3>like where am I going to get a job?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where am I going to live?</v>

490
00:33:48.051 --> 00:33:50.540
<v Speaker 3>Who am I going to marry?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How am I going to raise my children?</v>

491
00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:53.780
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are questions that are permanent</v>

492
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:58.810
<v Speaker 3>aspects of the human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also going to discover that this</v>

493
00:33:58.851 --> 00:34:02.610
<v Speaker 3>is not the kind of question in which</v>
<v Speaker 3>science has suddenly dl,</v>

494
00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>delivered a fantastic new answer.</v>

495
00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 3>People have been asking and answering</v>
<v Speaker 3>this question for a long time and</v>

496
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:15.920
<v Speaker 3>looking at some old thinkers can see you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can help you see the connections between</v>

497
00:34:15.921 --> 00:34:19.280
<v Speaker 3>the ways people originally asked these</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions and the way we do.</v>

498
00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.940
<v Speaker 3>But also give you a perspective on</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's been solved,</v>

499
00:34:23.570 --> 00:34:25.970
<v Speaker 3>which in some of these cases is very</v>
<v Speaker 3>little.</v>

500
00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.890
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

501
00:34:27.891 --> 00:34:31.670
<v Speaker 3>what remains for you to consider an</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>

502
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.210
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>determine by the way that you live your</v>

503
00:34:35.211 --> 00:34:38.090
<v Speaker 3>own life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The third thing is that great books of</v>

504
00:34:38.091 --> 00:34:43.091
<v Speaker 3>the past are going to engage you with a</v>
<v Speaker 3>number of great minds who don't share</v>

505
00:34:44.181 --> 00:34:47.360
<v Speaker 3>any of your assumptions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just as we were talking about with</v>

506
00:34:47.361 --> 00:34:49.010
<v Speaker 3>Plato,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a different culture,</v>

507
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 3>a different morality of different</v>
<v Speaker 3>religion,</v>

508
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:55.070
<v Speaker 3>a different politics call this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the value of strangeness,</v>

509
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 3>which is not only an additional</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective on what you believe,</v>

510
00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm going to claim is also a primary</v>

511
00:35:01.911 --> 00:35:06.911
<v Speaker 3>source of human creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fourth value is quite frankly,</v>

512
00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:10.400
<v Speaker 3>the value of building up your</v>
<v Speaker 3>intellectual muscle power.</v>

513
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.170
<v Speaker 3>You don't get to be a better wrestler by</v>
<v Speaker 3>a wrestling all the little kids in your</v>

514
00:35:15.171 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood and beating them up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sending them home crying.</v>

515
00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're going to be a better wrestler,</v>

516
00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.500
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to get your own</v>
<v Speaker 3>nose bloody by going up against people</v>

517
00:35:24.501 --> 00:35:28.430
<v Speaker 3>who are bigger and stronger and better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you are.</v>

518
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.320
<v Speaker 3>So finally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

519
00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:33.800
<v Speaker 3>there is the value of forming better</v>
<v Speaker 3>judgments.</v>

520
00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Once you've encountered with the best of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all and wrestle them to the ground,</v>

521
00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be much better position</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make your own good discerning</v>

522
00:35:44.401 --> 00:35:49.401
<v Speaker 3>judgments about where to spend your</v>
<v Speaker 3>precious time without having past</v>

523
00:35:49.471 --> 00:35:54.471
<v Speaker 3>generations of experts to do the reading</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might say ahead of you and post the</v>

524
00:35:55.621 --> 00:36:00.621
<v Speaker 3>signs without knowing how a book is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to influence other books and,</v>

525
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:01.860
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without,</v>

526
00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself being able to figure,</v>

527
00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.310
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the,</v>

528
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.091
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

529
00:36:06.091 --> 00:36:09.420
<v Speaker 3>what the views are going to be of this</v>
<v Speaker 3>book in the future.</v>

530
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will be able to tell junk from gold</v>

531
00:36:14.970 --> 00:36:18.060
<v Speaker 3>trash from something that's worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

532
00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:21.960
<v Speaker 3>Because you'll know when you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>up against,</v>

533
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:23.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

534
00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 3>a real mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You will have experienced the best that</v>

535
00:36:26.671 --> 00:36:27.504
<v Speaker 3>we know.</v>

536
00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:38.050
<v Speaker 3>So let's dig down a little bit into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>value of some old and outdated ideas.</v>

537
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.200
<v Speaker 3>A man named malthus in 1798 published a</v>
<v Speaker 3>classic work in political economy.</v>

538
00:36:44.961 --> 00:36:48.770
<v Speaker 3>It's called an essay in the principle of</v>
<v Speaker 3>population.</v>

539
00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:51.650
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the basic idea is that populations can</v>

540
00:36:51.651 --> 00:36:55.730
<v Speaker 3>only grow up to the point where they</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily collapsed because of limited</v>

541
00:36:55.731 --> 00:36:58.310
<v Speaker 3>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a famine and disease.</v>

542
00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.330
<v Speaker 3>But the essay explores the ideas and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of very interesting ways.</v>

543
00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.620
<v Speaker 3>And actually it was a major influence on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Charles Darwin and the development of</v>

544
00:37:06.621 --> 00:37:10.640
<v Speaker 3>the theory of evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Despite the game changing nature of this</v>

545
00:37:10.641 --> 00:37:13.550
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>economists and scientists of the</v>

546
00:37:13.551 --> 00:37:16.790
<v Speaker 3>industrial age have generally held that</v>
<v Speaker 3>malthus was fraud.</v>

547
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:19.640
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he predicted we were all going</v>

548
00:37:19.641 --> 00:37:23.950
<v Speaker 3>to die back in the 18th century.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He thought that we were going to outrun</v>

549
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:26.630
<v Speaker 3>the food sources with our population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

550
00:37:26.631 --> 00:37:29.870
<v Speaker 3>and that nothing could stop a headlong</v>
<v Speaker 3>rush over the cliff.</v>

551
00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:36.250
<v Speaker 3>What he did not take into proper account</v>
<v Speaker 3>were the game changing aspects of human</v>

552
00:37:36.471 --> 00:37:41.420
<v Speaker 3>ingenuity and creativity that would find</v>
<v Speaker 3>a way around resource bottlenecks.</v>

553
00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.520
<v Speaker 3>Now during the oil shocks of the 1970s.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you go back and look for this,</v>

554
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see that the ideas of malthus</v>

555
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:51.710
<v Speaker 3>came very much back into view.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

556
00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:55.880
<v Speaker 3>Because people were seeing resources</v>
<v Speaker 3>begin to run out.</v>

557
00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:01.180
<v Speaker 3>The world's population had doubled over</v>
<v Speaker 3>a period of about 30 to 60 years and it</v>

558
00:38:01.671 --> 00:38:03.680
<v Speaker 3>was going to going to be set to double</v>
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>

559
00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.760
<v Speaker 3>So Thomas Malthus and his ideas about</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens when you increase the</v>

560
00:38:07.761 --> 00:38:12.080
<v Speaker 3>population past the carrying load came</v>
<v Speaker 3>around for more currency.</v>

561
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:14.960
<v Speaker 3>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you google the name Malthus,</v>

562
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:18.470
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get over 3 million hits</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the Internet.</v>

563
00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:24.730
<v Speaker 3>His fundamental ideas are once again at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the center of debates about peak oil,</v>

564
00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:29.120
<v Speaker 3>environmental damage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>global population,</v>

565
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:34.640
<v Speaker 3>the prospects for global catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Malik doozy and ideas are everywhere and</v>

566
00:38:34.641 --> 00:38:39.641
<v Speaker 3>his work being invoked as people wonder</v>
<v Speaker 3>if the world is about to prove mouth</v>

567
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 3>this right in the end.</v>

568
00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:47.353
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

569
00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:52.710
<v Speaker 3>here's another example of old ideas</v>
<v Speaker 3>being mined for new insights in ancient</v>

570
00:38:53.441 --> 00:38:56.830
<v Speaker 3>Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotle wrote a book called when the</v>

571
00:38:56.831 --> 00:38:59.800
<v Speaker 3>comic can ethics or for short the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics,</v>

572
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a book about human</v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness and about what it takes to be</v>

573
00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:05.950
<v Speaker 3>a happy person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

574
00:39:05.951 --> 00:39:10.951
<v Speaker 3>we don't ordinarily associate the idea</v>
<v Speaker 3>of ethics with a work on happiness.</v>

575
00:39:11.561 --> 00:39:14.740
<v Speaker 3>We think about ethics as being things</v>
<v Speaker 3>like moral obligations,</v>

576
00:39:14.741 --> 00:39:16.310
<v Speaker 3>duties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

577
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.970
<v Speaker 3>what were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were called upon to perform.</v>

578
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:23.971
<v Speaker 3>Despite our desires to do other things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aristotle had a different perspective on</v>

579
00:39:24.881 --> 00:39:29.650
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was an original proponent of the idea</v>

580
00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:33.850
<v Speaker 3>and you may have heard this idea that</v>
<v Speaker 3>virtue is its own reward.</v>

581
00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Then in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that make you an excellent</v>

582
00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:39.760
<v Speaker 3>parent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>th th the the things that make you an</v>

583
00:39:39.761 --> 00:39:44.761
<v Speaker 3>excellent citizen are also the things if</v>
<v Speaker 3>pursued consciously and done well,</v>

584
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:48.910
<v Speaker 3>make you a happy human being.</v>

585
00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:53.200
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's a dedication to excellence.</v>

586
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:58.500
<v Speaker 3>We're excellence consists of the virtues</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are required for us to live well</v>

587
00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 3>and do well with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

588
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:06.130
<v Speaker 3>that is the foundation for human beings</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be happy.</v>

589
00:40:06.730 --> 00:40:11.730
<v Speaker 3>This goes these days by the name virtue</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethics and philosophers and</v>

590
00:40:12.071 --> 00:40:16.750
<v Speaker 3>psychologists all over the world are</v>
<v Speaker 3>studying what makes for human happiness.</v>

591
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:21.430
<v Speaker 3>Aristotle actually has something</v>
<v Speaker 3>extremely contemporary to contribute to</v>

592
00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:23.680
<v Speaker 3>that debate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

593
00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.860
<v Speaker 3>reading these works gives you a very</v>
<v Speaker 3>different sense of what progress</v>

594
00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:33.070
<v Speaker 3>consists of in one whole area of human</v>
<v Speaker 3>thought.</v>

595
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:38.340
<v Speaker 3>And even our notion of progress might</v>
<v Speaker 3>mean when we start to talk about</v>

596
00:40:38.591 --> 00:40:42.760
<v Speaker 3>something like human happiness are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're really new messages coming from</v>

597
00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:43.923
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

598
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.990
<v Speaker 3>from the cosmos about what it takes to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be happy.</v>

599
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:48.063
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

600
00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:56.930
<v Speaker 3>My third value or take away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

601
00:40:56.931 --> 00:40:59.780
<v Speaker 3>involved what I call the value of</v>
<v Speaker 3>strangeness.</v>

602
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:02.540
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this one's a little harder to explain.</v>

603
00:41:02.541 --> 00:41:06.200
<v Speaker 3>So let me use an analogy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've probably traveled.</v>

604
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:09.500
<v Speaker 3>People like to travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people travel a great deal.</v>

605
00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:12.410
<v Speaker 3>What do people feel like they learned</v>
<v Speaker 3>from traveling,</v>

606
00:41:12.411 --> 00:41:17.411
<v Speaker 3>particularly travel to another society?</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that good travelers,</v>

607
00:41:18.830 --> 00:41:23.090
<v Speaker 3>people who have done this well and spend</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough time in a foreign society to</v>

608
00:41:23.091 --> 00:41:28.091
<v Speaker 3>really learn something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they generally say that they're struck</v>

609
00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.640
<v Speaker 3>by the ways that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that society is different from our own.</v>

610
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 3>And they're struck by the kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>answers that people give to questions</v>

611
00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:37.941
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

612
00:41:37.941 --> 00:41:40.880
<v Speaker 3>we suddenly discover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've made a lot of assumptions about</v>

613
00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:45.620
<v Speaker 3>that is we've made an assumption about</v>
<v Speaker 3>our lifestyle or an assumption about</v>

614
00:41:45.621 --> 00:41:48.920
<v Speaker 3>what people want out of life or an</v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption about how people are going to</v>

615
00:41:48.921 --> 00:41:53.921
<v Speaker 3>get those things that actually isn't an</v>
<v Speaker 3>operating in this other society at all.</v>

616
00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 3>And of course it might make us stop and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

617
00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.110
<v Speaker 3>is our way of doing this actually the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best way of doing it?</v>

618
00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:03.020
<v Speaker 3>Might I pick up some ideas from this</v>
<v Speaker 3>other place?</v>

619
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:07.370
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>great books can have some of this same</v>

620
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.400
<v Speaker 3>effect through the value of strangeness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's consider two women writers for a</v>

621
00:42:14.001 --> 00:42:17.570
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you've been paying attention,</v>

622
00:42:17.571 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 3>you might have noticed that I haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>talked about any women thinkers or</v>

623
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:24.230
<v Speaker 3>writers up to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And in that regard,</v>

624
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 3>it's important to remember that until</v>
<v Speaker 3>very recent times,</v>

625
00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:32.150
<v Speaker 3>very few women had access to the kinds</v>
<v Speaker 3>of educations or were given the kind of</v>

626
00:42:32.151 --> 00:42:36.060
<v Speaker 3>encouragement to engage in this kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

627
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.930
<v Speaker 3>thinking or this kind of work or this</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of reading,</v>

628
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:40.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as they are today.</v>

629
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:42.740
<v Speaker 3>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

630
00:42:42.741 --> 00:42:45.240
<v Speaker 3>it's only very recently,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

631
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:50.260
<v Speaker 3>that women have entered a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this long conversation.</v>

632
00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:51.620
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

633
00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:56.650
<v Speaker 3>Because they were excluded from Jane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Austin was a brilliant novelist and what</v>

634
00:42:58.401 --> 00:43:03.200
<v Speaker 3>Jane austen wrote about were the manners</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ways of life and the,</v>

635
00:43:03.201 --> 00:43:06.170
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage and family arrangements of</v>

636
00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.760
<v Speaker 3>English country gentry of the late 17</v>
<v Speaker 3>hundreds.</v>

637
00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.120
<v Speaker 3>Now it's very unlikely that you're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to have much knowledge about the ways of</v>

638
00:43:18.081 --> 00:43:22.670
<v Speaker 3>life that were current among the English</v>
<v Speaker 3>gentry in the late 17 hundreds.</v>

639
00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:24.680
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

640
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Speaker 3>that is just what makes encountering</v>
<v Speaker 3>them valuable and what makes</v>

641
00:43:28.011 --> 00:43:33.011
<v Speaker 3>encountering Jane austen herself</v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable for she knows this world and</v>

642
00:43:33.531 --> 00:43:37.730
<v Speaker 3>these people inside and out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she's an exceptional,</v>

643
00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:42.380
<v Speaker 3>clever and devastating observer of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>human heart.</v>

644
00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.830
<v Speaker 3>You come to know both the world that</v>
<v Speaker 3>these people occupied and the ways in</v>

645
00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:53.411
<v Speaker 3>which they occupied this world in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that nature that no other author,</v>

646
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.570
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is ever going to reveal or take.</v>

647
00:43:56.571 --> 00:43:58.490
<v Speaker 3>Another example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emily Dickinson.</v>

648
00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.550
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emily Dickinson was one of the two or</v>

649
00:44:01.551 --> 00:44:04.820
<v Speaker 3>three master poets that the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States has produced.</v>

650
00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:10.510
<v Speaker 3>She had an even more narrow and an even</v>
<v Speaker 3>stranger world to show us consisting</v>

651
00:44:11.241 --> 00:44:15.860
<v Speaker 3>primarily of the workings of her own</v>
<v Speaker 3>mind and her emotions,</v>

652
00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.070
<v Speaker 3>which were exceptionally focused and</v>
<v Speaker 3>intense.</v>

653
00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:24.820
<v Speaker 3>It was Dickinson or virtual reckless who</v>
<v Speaker 3>said partying is all we know of heaven</v>

654
00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:32.140
<v Speaker 3>and is all we need of hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She also said one need be a chamber to</v>

655
00:44:33.451 --> 00:44:35.940
<v Speaker 3>be haunted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also this,</v>

656
00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:41.790
<v Speaker 3>an ear can break a human heart as</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly as a spear.</v>

657
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:47.870
<v Speaker 3>We wish the ear had not a heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So dangerously near Reading Emily</v>

658
00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Dickinson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll introduce you to a mind and a</v>

659
00:44:52.441 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 3>heart that simply does not work well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you hearts.</v>

660
00:44:55.560 --> 00:45:00.560
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work like mine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she knows yours and she knows her</v>

661
00:45:00.571 --> 00:45:05.160
<v Speaker 3>own as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thoughts like Dickinson's and like</v>

662
00:45:05.161 --> 00:45:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Austin's can dislodge us from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday world.</v>

663
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:11.550
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the things that we're familiar with,</v>

664
00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:15.330
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the ways that we tend to find it</v>

665
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:20.280
<v Speaker 3>natural to think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't that the value of an education</v>

666
00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.950
<v Speaker 3>and isn't one of the most practical</v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

667
00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

668
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:24.871
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

669
00:45:24.871 --> 00:45:27.120
<v Speaker 3>that the world is seeking the world of</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

670
00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:29.580
<v Speaker 3>the role of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>world government,</v>

671
00:45:29.581 --> 00:45:32.280
<v Speaker 3>the role of the arts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even the world of academia,</v>

672
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:38.030
<v Speaker 3>aren't they seeking for people who take</v>
<v Speaker 3>up new and strange and different and</v>

673
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:40.860
<v Speaker 3>creative perspectives?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

674
00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:45.600
<v Speaker 3>isn't this takeaway from these great and</v>
<v Speaker 3>classic works maybe among the most</v>

675
00:45:45.601 --> 00:45:47.490
<v Speaker 3>practical things that they have to have</v>

676
00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:48.383
<v Speaker 4>offers?</v>

677
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:58.430
<v Speaker 3>My fourth value involved a building your</v>
<v Speaker 3>muscles and your reading skills and the,</v>

678
00:45:58.530 --> 00:45:58.991
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

679
00:45:58.991 --> 00:46:02.130
<v Speaker 3>the ways that you're going to tackle</v>
<v Speaker 3>increasingly difficult material.</v>

680
00:46:02.850 --> 00:46:05.220
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think this one requires</v>

681
00:46:05.221 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 3>illustration so much as it does a</v>
<v Speaker 3>reminder.</v>

682
00:46:08.850 --> 00:46:10.860
<v Speaker 3>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't get to the Olympics by</v>

683
00:46:10.861 --> 00:46:15.861
<v Speaker 3>training with weaklings and these works</v>
<v Speaker 3>have survived in part because they've</v>

684
00:46:16.291 --> 00:46:17.790
<v Speaker 3>ripped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>been written by geniuses.</v>

685
00:46:17.791 --> 00:46:20.310
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that these are mine's worth</v>

686
00:46:20.311 --> 00:46:25.311
<v Speaker 3>wrestling with because so many have the</v>
<v Speaker 3>good news is that does not mean that you</v>

687
00:46:25.831 --> 00:46:29.160
<v Speaker 3>have to be a genius to understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank God.</v>

688
00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:31.170
<v Speaker 3>Or I wouldn't have made it very far</v>
<v Speaker 3>myself.</v>

689
00:46:31.770 --> 00:46:33.420
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard the saying,</v>

690
00:46:33.421 --> 00:46:37.140
<v Speaker 3>she got to where she is by standing on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the shoulders of giants.</v>

691
00:46:37.590 --> 00:46:42.590
<v Speaker 3>So here are the giants master the skills</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it takes to get up on their</v>

692
00:46:42.811 --> 00:46:46.740
<v Speaker 3>shoulders and you're going to see quite</v>
<v Speaker 3>a distance.</v>

693
00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll see more than they saw.</v>

694
00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll also be prepared,</v>

695
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:55.200
<v Speaker 3>better prepared to grapple with lesser</v>
<v Speaker 3>works,</v>

696
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that don't stand</v>

697
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:57.763
<v Speaker 4>this tall.</v>

698
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.600
<v Speaker 3>So for the fifth value,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said that to the extent that you</v>

699
00:47:06.601 --> 00:47:09.540
<v Speaker 3>encounter engage classic work</v>
<v Speaker 3>successfully,</v>

700
00:47:09.990 --> 00:47:14.580
<v Speaker 3>you'd be a better judge of modern works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And my example here has to be</v>

701
00:47:14.581 --> 00:47:16.140
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

702
00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 3>many of the greatest critics and readers</v>
<v Speaker 3>of world literature,</v>

703
00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:23.040
<v Speaker 3>including across cultures and across</v>
<v Speaker 3>boundaries,</v>

704
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.250
<v Speaker 3>have had the same basic view of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare.</v>

705
00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 3>And that is whatever his flaws,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

706
00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.940
<v Speaker 3>whatever the weaknesses and whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 3>strengths of other writers.</v>

707
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:39.270
<v Speaker 3>I know one no literary giant has ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>written more profoundly or more</v>

708
00:47:40.751 --> 00:47:45.751
<v Speaker 3>inventively or more imaginatively about</v>
<v Speaker 3>the human condition than Shakespeare.</v>

709
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Harold Bloom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great literary critic critic where I</v>

710
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.710
<v Speaker 3>work and teach here at Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

711
00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:57.970
<v Speaker 3>called one of his books on Shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the invention of the human.</v>

712
00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:01.390
<v Speaker 3>And he meant by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Shakespeare with these characters</v>

713
00:48:01.391 --> 00:48:06.391
<v Speaker 3>like falstaff and hamlet and king lear</v>
<v Speaker 3>quite literally created around the year</v>

714
00:48:07.901 --> 00:48:12.490
<v Speaker 3>1600 our modern sense of what it means</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be a human being,</v>

715
00:48:12.491 --> 00:48:14.230
<v Speaker 3>acting and thinking in the world.</v>

716
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.640
<v Speaker 3>Many of his hundreds of memorable</v>
<v Speaker 3>characters,</v>

717
00:48:18.090 --> 00:48:23.040
<v Speaker 3>men and women either vividly or</v>
<v Speaker 3>unexpectedly respond to their life</v>

718
00:48:23.041 --> 00:48:27.300
<v Speaker 3>situations in ways that we couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>predict or typecast,</v>

719
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.200
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or they open up new perspectives on what</v>

720
00:48:31.201 --> 00:48:36.201
<v Speaker 3>truly motivates each of us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So once you have successfully engaged</v>

721
00:48:36.901 --> 00:48:38.400
<v Speaker 3>Shakespeare and his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

722
00:48:38.401 --> 00:48:42.270
<v Speaker 3>in his comedies and in his tragedies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to very quickly since,</v>

723
00:48:42.271 --> 00:48:46.950
<v Speaker 3>and other writers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they're capable of doing</v>

724
00:48:46.951 --> 00:48:49.620
<v Speaker 3>the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if they are,</v>

725
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.570
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be drawn on to read</v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

726
00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:55.800
<v Speaker 3>And if they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can safely set them aside because</v>

727
00:48:55.801 --> 00:48:58.100
<v Speaker 3>you've got a better standard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

728
00:48:58.130 --> 00:48:59.820
<v Speaker 3>against which to make your choices.</v>

729
00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:09.240
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that you're persuaded of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>five valuable things that I say you can</v>

730
00:49:09.241 --> 00:49:13.830
<v Speaker 3>take away from these work if you include</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of them on your course schedule in</v>

731
00:49:13.831 --> 00:49:18.831
<v Speaker 3>college.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could your life be better personally if</v>

732
00:49:19.291 --> 00:49:22.080
<v Speaker 3>you invited some of these authors into</v>
<v Speaker 3>it?</v>

733
00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:25.830
<v Speaker 3>And how so?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So think about it like this.</v>

734
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:31.280
<v Speaker 3>I shared an experience a number of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago when my son got involved.</v>

735
00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I got involved as well in the boy</v>

736
00:49:35.371 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Speaker 3>scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

737
00:49:36.781 --> 00:49:37.950
<v Speaker 3>we hiked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we camp,</v>

738
00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.610
<v Speaker 3>we make friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

739
00:49:39.630 --> 00:49:43.020
<v Speaker 3>W we had lots of families and the troop,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lots of other,</v>

740
00:49:43.050 --> 00:49:44.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other adults on the trips.</v>

741
00:49:45.090 --> 00:49:46.440
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

742
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:48.150
<v Speaker 3>it was all fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was wonderful.</v>

743
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:53.730
<v Speaker 3>But then we came to a point in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>development of these young men and their</v>

744
00:49:53.731 --> 00:49:57.900
<v Speaker 3>skills where we were prepared to</v>
<v Speaker 3>introduce them to something more</v>

745
00:49:57.901 --> 00:50:01.410
<v Speaker 3>adventurous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we planned a two week wilderness</v>

746
00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:04.830
<v Speaker 3>expedition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that we hadn't come close to</v>

747
00:50:04.831 --> 00:50:06.750
<v Speaker 3>doing a with these young men before.</v>

748
00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.100
<v Speaker 3>I was very excited.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

749
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.930
<v Speaker 3>it was something that I had done and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted my son to have the same</v>

750
00:50:12.931 --> 00:50:17.931
<v Speaker 3>experience as I had had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let me get this straight.</v>

751
00:50:18.241 --> 00:50:21.540
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to carry twice the weight on</v>

752
00:50:21.541 --> 00:50:24.660
<v Speaker 3>our backs that we ever have before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the food.</v>

753
00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:29.090
<v Speaker 3>The food is going to be pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to have to purify every</v>

754
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:31.850
<v Speaker 3>single drop of water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We drank a,</v>

755
00:50:31.851 --> 00:50:35.660
<v Speaker 3>we'll have to figure out our own trail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be in rugged mountains.</v>

756
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:38.510
<v Speaker 3>We'll probably spend some time getting</v>
<v Speaker 3>lost.</v>

757
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:43.670
<v Speaker 3>What exactly am I going to get out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this that I can't get from the hiking</v>

758
00:50:43.671 --> 00:50:47.990
<v Speaker 3>and camping that we've already done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I've liked perfectly fine and</v>

759
00:50:47.991 --> 00:50:50.120
<v Speaker 3>which we did without all this pain and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hassle.</v>

760
00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:53.360
<v Speaker 3>Smart boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good questions.</v>

761
00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:55.700
<v Speaker 3>So I finally said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

762
00:50:56.150 --> 00:51:00.110
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can really tell you what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get out of this.</v>

763
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:04.370
<v Speaker 3>You have to experience it for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you'll know.</v>

764
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.610
<v Speaker 3>So I guess I'm just asking you to trust</v>
<v Speaker 3>me on this.</v>

765
00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:13.940
<v Speaker 3>So my son Paul certainly had some</v>
<v Speaker 3>skeptical company among the other scouts</v>

766
00:51:13.941 --> 00:51:16.130
<v Speaker 3>and the troop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And sure enough,</v>

767
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:20.210
<v Speaker 3>a few days into this expedition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things began to deteriorate.</v>

768
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:23.000
<v Speaker 3>We had some lousy weather.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

769
00:51:23.001 --> 00:51:24.530
<v Speaker 3>there's blisters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

770
00:51:24.560 --> 00:51:26.420
<v Speaker 3>people are hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

771
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 3>the boys are a ragging on each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's really getting along.</v>

772
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:32.330
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

773
00:51:32.331 --> 00:51:33.470
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my son,</v>

774
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:35.990
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is looking at me with those all knowing</v>

775
00:51:35.991 --> 00:51:40.991
<v Speaker 3>eyes of a 16 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then the boys started to toughen up.</v>

776
00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:46.190
<v Speaker 3>The weather cleared.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got higher up in the mountains.</v>

777
00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:50.180
<v Speaker 3>They started to rely on each other more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They figured out how to break camp</v>

778
00:51:50.181 --> 00:51:53.830
<v Speaker 3>efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so one day we get to a,</v>

779
00:51:53.890 --> 00:51:56.240
<v Speaker 3>a really terrific climb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

780
00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:58.580
<v Speaker 3>during which there was a fair amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>complaining.</v>

781
00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a brutal effort.</v>

782
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And when we emerged from the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the tree line,</v>

783
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:07.850
<v Speaker 3>we're on top of the highest peak in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>region.</v>

784
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:10.290
<v Speaker 3>We were exhilarated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

785
00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 3>the boys were exhilarated and my son</v>
<v Speaker 3>came over to him and he said,</v>

786
00:52:14.211 --> 00:52:16.700
<v Speaker 3>Hey dad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

787
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:17.241
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

788
00:52:17.241 --> 00:52:18.380
<v Speaker 3>this is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

789
00:52:18.381 --> 00:52:19.610
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he said,</v>

790
00:52:19.611 --> 00:52:23.720
<v Speaker 3>I just want you to know I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

791
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:25.670
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>

792
00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:31.420
<v Speaker 3>this is by far the most fantastic thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we've ever done together.</v>

793
00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:38.710
<v Speaker 3>So what did we learned by virtue of</v>
<v Speaker 3>taking a much more arduous,</v>

794
00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:45.820
<v Speaker 3>a much more difficult journey than we</v>
<v Speaker 3>had taken up to that point in our</v>

795
00:52:46.611 --> 00:52:48.800
<v Speaker 3>scouting experience?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

796
00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:51.980
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's now got an experience of the</v>

797
00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:53.380
<v Speaker 3>outdoors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

798
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:55.670
<v Speaker 3>that's given him a permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

799
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:58.160
<v Speaker 3>a permanent interests that he can pursue</v>
<v Speaker 3>in life.</v>

800
00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course there was also the element</v>

801
00:53:00.891 --> 00:53:05.060
<v Speaker 3>of the experience that revolved around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the connection that he and I made</v>

802
00:53:05.061 --> 00:53:07.700
<v Speaker 3>together by virtue of having the</v>
<v Speaker 3>experience together.</v>

803
00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 3>So remember what Adler said in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

804
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Of course the great books are the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>difficult to read,</v>

805
00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 3>but they are in another sense the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>readable,</v>

806
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.400
<v Speaker 3>both for the less and the more competent</v>
<v Speaker 3>because they are the most instructive.</v>

807
00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:30.690
<v Speaker 3>And that's the key word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I do not mean says Adler most</v>

808
00:53:30.691 --> 00:53:32.850
<v Speaker 3>readable in the sense of with the least</v>
<v Speaker 3>effort,</v>

809
00:53:32.851 --> 00:53:36.420
<v Speaker 3>even for the expert.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that these books reward every</v>

810
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:39.570
<v Speaker 3>degree of effort and ability to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>maximum.</v>

811
00:53:40.650 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 3>So here's something else to think about</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's something,</v>

812
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:47.220
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Adler has to say and it goes beyond</v>

813
00:53:47.221 --> 00:53:50.320
<v Speaker 3>the five takeaways that I gave you for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

814
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.490
<v Speaker 3>things that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things of value that you can derive from</v>

815
00:53:53.491 --> 00:53:56.730
<v Speaker 3>these books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to encounter a lot of</v>

816
00:53:56.731 --> 00:53:57.540
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

817
00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:02.250
<v Speaker 3>in your life that you need to know and</v>
<v Speaker 3>things that you need to learn about that</v>

818
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:05.580
<v Speaker 3>aren't going to change you much at all.</v>

819
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:08.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've learned many of these things</v>

820
00:54:08.281 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You learned how to drive a car.</v>

821
00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:13.500
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that didn't change who you were as a</v>

822
00:54:13.501 --> 00:54:18.060
<v Speaker 3>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm suggesting to you now that you're</v>

823
00:54:18.061 --> 00:54:21.720
<v Speaker 3>going to be in the same position with</v>
<v Speaker 3>relation to these works.</v>

824
00:54:21.721 --> 00:54:26.700
<v Speaker 3>We've been talking about in this lecture</v>
<v Speaker 3>as the scout who's done the weekend</v>

825
00:54:26.701 --> 00:54:28.170
<v Speaker 3>hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

826
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:30.200
<v Speaker 3>taking the day trip,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

827
00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.450
<v Speaker 3>maybe cook breakfast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

828
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:35.760
<v Speaker 3>at the camporee and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

829
00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:40.740
<v Speaker 3>remember how I said at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 3>that aristotle said it's our nature to</v>

830
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:45.510
<v Speaker 3>want to know things well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just as it's our nature to work,</v>

831
00:54:45.511 --> 00:54:48.150
<v Speaker 3>to play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to find a mate to live in society.</v>

832
00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>remember how I said that wisdom is</v>

833
00:54:52.381 --> 00:54:55.590
<v Speaker 3>something different from knowledge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

834
00:54:55.591 --> 00:54:59.550
<v Speaker 3>here's my final thought for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's a deep paradox of learning.</v>

835
00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:05.690
<v Speaker 3>You don't necessarily know what you are</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for until you find it.</v>

836
00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:11.280
<v Speaker 3>And it's the effort of finding it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually turns you into a different</v>

837
00:55:11.281 --> 00:55:16.200
<v Speaker 3>person than the one who set out on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>journey to begin with.</v>

838
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:21.270
<v Speaker 3>And that's why reading these great works</v>
<v Speaker 3>is very similar,</v>

839
00:55:21.271 --> 00:55:25.140
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the experience that my son had of a</v>

840
00:55:25.141 --> 00:55:30.141
<v Speaker 3>wilderness expedition after never having</v>
<v Speaker 3>attempted anything more than what you</v>

841
00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:35.181
<v Speaker 3>can get on the low lying ground.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you finally do achieve a,</v>

842
00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:40.110
<v Speaker 3>a radical new perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when it's not just a matter of taking in</v>

843
00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:44.250
<v Speaker 3>bits of information and knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a matter of changing how you</v>

844
00:55:44.251 --> 00:55:48.300
<v Speaker 3>put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And also it's a matter of changing who</v>

845
00:55:48.301 --> 00:55:51.060
<v Speaker 3>you are as a result.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

846
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:55.050
<v Speaker 3>you will see a different value in these</v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

847
00:55:55.140 --> 00:55:56.700
<v Speaker 3>And for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these books,</v>

848
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:59.160
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you're also going to see yourself in</v>

849
00:55:59.161 --> 00:56:04.161
<v Speaker 3>a new light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I give you the only answer that I</v>

850
00:56:05.951 --> 00:56:08.940
<v Speaker 3>really can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best answer I know</v>

851
00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.240
<v Speaker 3>why.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Read these books.</v>

852
00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:18.200
<v Speaker 3>It's the same answer I gave my son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You climb up into the mountains,</v>

853
00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:22.040
<v Speaker 3>you make your most strenuous effort.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

854
00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:23.860
<v Speaker 3>you give it everything have.</v>

855
00:56:24.790 --> 00:56:26.050
<v Speaker 2>And what's your reward?</v>

856
00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:30.360
<v Speaker 4>It's the view.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the view.</v>

857
00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:32.400
<v Speaker 4>Thank you very much.</v>
