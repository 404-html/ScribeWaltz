1
00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.010
<v Speaker 1>There is no quick solution to all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

2
00:00:09.011 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

3
00:00:11.831 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>the Security Council to use all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools available to them,</v>

4
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>including sanctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at whether we can put</v>

5
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>perpetrators to justice and to put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>on their lists.</v>

6
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the government in the DRC and</v>

7
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>everywhere where this is a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only an African problem to take</v>

8
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>this seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also to do everything they can to ensure</v>

9
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:45.331
<v Speaker 1>that we put an end to impunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to address the problem of impunity and</v>

10
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>also to assist the women to empower</v>
<v Speaker 1>women to make sure that they have a</v>

11
00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>voice and a seat at the table where</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions are made.</v>

12
00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>And so there are a number of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UN has to ensure that in</v>

13
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>peacekeeping operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can protect the civilians.</v>

14
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:09.691
<v Speaker 1>And that means women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to look at the best ways to</v>

15
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>protect civilians</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we are contacted by a lot of people</v>

16
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:22.931
<v Speaker 1>who have great ideas about to equip</v>
<v Speaker 1>women with everything from sort of small</v>

17
00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>weapons that could help them to defend</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

18
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a communication gadgets.</v>

19
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:32.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can,</v>

20
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.880
<v Speaker 1>one other women that they can call for</v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>etc. And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everything is worth testing.</v>

23
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>we hAve to do everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

25
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>the thing is it should not fall on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>women to actually also have to sort of</v>

26
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>physIcally defend themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a response.</v>

27
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not a women's issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a peace and security issue and</v>

28
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>we have to make sure that we go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perpetrators.</v>

29
00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:07.441
<v Speaker 1>So I would put much more focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on fInding the perpetrators and</v>

30
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:12.641
<v Speaker 1>punishing them to close every exit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every possible career possibility for,</v>

31
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>for these guys so that they know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no mercy for,</v>

32
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>for rapists.</v>
