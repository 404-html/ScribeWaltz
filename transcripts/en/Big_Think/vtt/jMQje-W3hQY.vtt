1
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a loaded question with me actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

2
00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally.</v>

4
00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I was born there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and the first several years of my life</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived there and the plan was to stay</v>

6
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

7
00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>this omic revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>last up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

9
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we moved to Los Angeles.</v>

10
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>I was raised in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my formative years were actually</v>

11
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:40.031
<v Speaker 1>spent in New York from 18 onwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have a sort of ultra hyphenated</v>

12
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess is Iranian American and um,</v>

13
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeleno and New Yorker by coastal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by cultural,</v>

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time of the hostage crisis,</v>

15
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>they were still in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because my,</v>

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>my mother and my father were both</v>
<v Speaker 1>educated,</v>

18
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad to a degree.</v>

19
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>when they got to the u s they spoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>English,</v>

21
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.620
<v Speaker 1>they were able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>work here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>but for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the fear came in just getting</v>

25
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>out of Iran.</v>

26
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the airports were shut down when they</v>

27
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get out because of the Iran,</v>

28
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

29
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>they were basically sort of Gypsies</v>
<v Speaker 1>through much of Europe.</v>

31
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in Turkey than they were.</v>

32
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>That's from there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went to France to Germany,</v>

33
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they've just finally went to</v>

34
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles by default because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what all the Iranians were doing.</v>

35
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't so bad for them.</v>

36
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>And I imagine it wasn't so bad for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Iranians because they all thoughts</v>

37
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>was temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only had two suitcases with them.</v>

39
00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

40
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all their stuff is still and in</v>

41
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>house they own any Iran to this day</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's left pretty much untouched.</v>

42
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Everything as it was when they fled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when,</v>

43
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>when they talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people talk about Iranians flaying maybe</v>

44
00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>they really did flee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>some of them made the decision quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly for some of,</v>

46
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>for some people like my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an almost overnight a decision</v>

47
00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>because it really never seemed like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be permanent.</v>

48
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very tricky question as well.</v>

49
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to become more Iranian.</v>

51
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

52
00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've now,</v>

53
00:02:42.371 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>since the novel came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been forced to consider myself as an</v>

54
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:50.311
<v Speaker 1>Iranian American more and more so my</v>
<v Speaker 1>family is fairly traditional Iranian</v>

55
00:02:50.441 --> 00:02:51.910
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.180
<v Speaker 1>but the novel really split me into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>made me sort of consider being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>California and,</v>

58
00:02:58.531 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>and a New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in some ways I emerged more confused.</v>
