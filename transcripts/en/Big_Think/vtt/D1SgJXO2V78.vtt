1
00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>The economy is in bad shape and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna stay in bad shape for a while.</v>

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>He kind of feeds on itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are fewer jobs over whether a few</v>

3
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 1>people will spending money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore everybody's reach retracting</v>

4
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then this is a smaller profit.</v>

5
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>So they let people go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes on and on until finally somebody</v>

6
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>like Roosevelt comes along and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got nothing to fear but fear itself.</v>

7
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.570
<v Speaker 1>And then fortunately he was a World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>II came along and I read a basic</v>

8
00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>recovery of the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I wanted a world war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>to rejuvenate our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to have to learn to do it</v>

11
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:38.861
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

12
00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>we're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very global world and you know,</v>

14
00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>I already nixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes one engine,</v>

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get the thing going again this time</v>

16
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>the engine will probably be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>the Far East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and India.</v>

18
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have to learn how to police</v>

19
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to say,</v>

20
00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the right thing to do.</v>

21
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And until the majority of businessmen</v>

22
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>are the big majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bismuth say that we're still going to</v>

23
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>have the same sort of problems we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>recurring.</v>
