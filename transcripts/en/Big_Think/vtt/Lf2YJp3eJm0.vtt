1
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.770
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>really seen in my perspective,</v>

2
00:00:09.771 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>the Internet changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is who's using it and to how it's</v>

3
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:15.860
<v Speaker 1>being used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I went to school at Uc Santa Cruz right</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the Internet was really being</v>

5
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>developed and I can remember doing my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>my coding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>my das coding and I was on computers</v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>It was a very impersonal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>medium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 1>and then websites came where you went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the website and you got information and</v>

11
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>maybe you did ecommerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's really changed about the</v>

12
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Internet now it's become much more of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate of tool.</v>

13
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>It's about for many people it's about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

14
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>It's about we go on Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about the books that they might</v>

15
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:44.661
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>what's recommended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're reading the reviews that they're</v>

17
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>their friends or even strangers instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of just advertisement.</v>

18
00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>So the whole Internet has become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with facebook,</v>

19
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>with my space is become much more of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate and personal thing.</v>

20
00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 1>And because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the dynamics and who is</v>

21
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>using it have really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it started off as sort of a</v>

22
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>white male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a geeky tool and now actually</v>

23
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.330
<v Speaker 1>more women are online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The men are more women are blogging than</v>

24
00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>men are women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a women's a medium.</v>

25
00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:15.830
<v Speaker 1>If you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we are through our brain</v>

26
00:01:15.831 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're wired to be connected to other</v>

27
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>people and the Internet is such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful way to connect whether it's</v>

28
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:22.970
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>my space or I'm a facebook or twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of these things are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come and go.</v>

31
00:01:29.691 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I think twitter will come and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

32
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There might be a new version of twitter</v>

33
00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that technology may change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is is that people are</v>

34
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 1>gaining relationships in new ways than</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ever have been.</v>

35
00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Like I can talk to someone in Ghana</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a problem with genital mutilation</v>

36
00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>that I never was before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's become much more of an intimate</v>

37
00:01:46.701 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Speaker 1>tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's changed politics.</v>

38
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting now with Intel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy Grove is always poking holes in his</v>

39
00:01:58.411 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>company to try to find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>whereas competitors are going to come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and take them out all at one time was</v>

41
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 1>the breakthrough technology and then all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden aol is sort of an old story</v>

42
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>in the new stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook and sort of what will be next</v>

43
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>after that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much.</v>

44
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>The convergence between the web and</v>
<v Speaker 1>television is completely is what's next.</v>

45
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

46
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>almost every household has a television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our lives.</v>

47
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>It's part of our identity and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimacy that we see both through the</v>

48
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Internet and also what people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying watching.</v>

49
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.030
<v Speaker 1>People love American idol because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intimate show.</v>

50
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>They're seeing people like themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflecting.</v>

51
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not sure exactly where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

52
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>but I know we're going to continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have user generated content.</v>

53
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to be booking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're creating their own television</v>

54
00:02:43.921 --> 00:02:44.920
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be much more instant</v>

57
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:51.990
<v Speaker 1>response to the way that television</v>
<v Speaker 1>works and we're just going to see a</v>

58
00:02:51.991 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>convergence.</v>
