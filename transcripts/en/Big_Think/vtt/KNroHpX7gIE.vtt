00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.423
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>Was a case recently in Florida where a</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager was arrested for murder.</v>

3
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.460
<v Speaker 1>He was a student at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida and he was accused of murdering</v>

4
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:18.860
<v Speaker 1>his roommate and best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were living together for three</v>

5
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:23.861
<v Speaker 1>months and after three months he killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>his best friend and roommate because the</v>

6
00:00:24.141 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>murderer had a girlfriend and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend dumped the murderer for the</v>

7
00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>roommate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it turns out,</v>

8
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>when the kid murdered his roommate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a problem.</v>

9
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>He didn't know where to bury the dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

10
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>But as an 18 year old millennial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew where to get an answer to his</v>

11
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He asked Siri,</v>

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>where can I bury a dead body?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out Siri answered his</v>

13
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>question and proposed mines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumps reservoirs,</v>

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>swamps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rivers.</v>

15
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you ask Siri where to bury a dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>

16
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>she will give you answers to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

17
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>So in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:56.751 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>we used to talk about Bonnie and Clyde,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've entered the age of Siri and</v>

19
00:01:00.921 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Clyde were clearly algorithms will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnamed,</v>

20
00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>co-conspirators and younger criminals</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying out attacks.</v>

21
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I is being used across the board in our</v>

22
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>society via Algorithms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>And in fact most of these algorithms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are called black box algorithms.</v>

24
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Speaker 1>There's a harvard professor called Frank</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pasquali who wrote a whole book on black</v>

25
00:01:22.851 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>box algorithms that talks about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>little we know about these algorithms</v>

26
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>and what some of the dangers might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

27
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>there's an algorithm that determines</v>
<v Speaker 1>your credit score,</v>

28
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>fico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what goes into it.</v>

29
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And precisely,</v>

30
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>nobody knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an algorithm that determines who</v>

31
00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>gets selected for secondary screening at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the airport.</v>

32
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because you bought a one way</v>
<v Speaker 1>ticket babies cause she paid for cash.</v>

33
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's because you have the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion or the wrong skin color,</v>

34
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 1>We don't know clearly at all what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>being encoded into these algorithms and</v>

36
00:01:57.081 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>so that opens up the door for them to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>abused.</v>

37
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>We saw a examples of this on Wall Street</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Flash Boys,</v>

38
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>right on rapid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>trading on Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact of the matter is only a</v>

40
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>minuscule amount of trading on Wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>Street is carried out by human beings.</v>

41
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>The overwhelming majority of trading is</v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithmic in nature.</v>

42
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>It's preprogrammed so that if the price</v>
<v Speaker 1>of soybeans go down,</v>

43
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>all of these additional steps will take</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

44
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>If some event happens in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traders will buy or sell based upon that</v>

45
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 1>information and it all goes so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no time for human intervention,</v>

46
00:02:30.981 --> 00:02:35.981
<v Speaker 1>and we saw an implication of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently when the Associated Press,</v>

47
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>twitter feed was hacked a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody took over the official AP</v>

48
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>twitter feed and they put out a tweet</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the official site that said,</v>

49
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>breaking news explosions at the White</v>
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>

50
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>President Obama injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out that never happened,</v>

51
00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.650
<v Speaker 1>but all of the algorithms that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitoring the net looking for the</v>

52
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:58.130
<v Speaker 1>latest news that they can trade on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picked up on it immediately from a</v>

53
00:02:58.131 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>trusted source and because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived a terrorist attack that caused</v>

54
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the market a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive sell off in just three minutes.</v>

55
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Because of this one tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the market fell $136 billion,</v>

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.810
<v Speaker 1>$136 billion evaluation was evaporated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 180 seconds just because of one we</v>

57
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>would tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that was carried out by an</v>

58
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>organization known as the Syrian</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic army.</v>

59
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>They're back trained and funded by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iranian government.</v>

60
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Now in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did that for the purposes of</v>

61
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:34.300
<v Speaker 1>mischief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also could have shorted the</v>

62
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>market at the same time and made a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money on this.</v>

63
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>So our algorithms are going way faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we realize and they're running</v>

64
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>things that we don't even understand.</v>

65
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go for an MRI exam in the</v>

66
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mri via its algorithms are actually</v>

67
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>interpreting the data for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiologist in many ways before they</v>

68
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>even read that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you fly on autopilot on an</v>

69
00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably more than 90% of your</v>

70
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>flight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an algorithm that's running the</v>

71
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>plane and all of those can be hacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of the attacks that occur in</v>

72
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>cyberspace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they be virus attacks,</v>

73
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>ransomware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denial of service attacks are all</v>

74
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.050
<v Speaker 1>scripted to run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means a computer hacker or a</v>

75
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>criminal writes some code and the code</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes off and carries out the crime,</v>

76
00:04:20.471 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>which means crime can scale and it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale exponentially.</v>

77
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:26.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we've seen some massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>uptick.</v>

78
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
