1
00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>I changed the world everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am an agent of change,</v>

2
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully positive change and that's</v>

3
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>the way I view my work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>when I say I changed the world every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

5
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we try to ensure that no child in</v>

6
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:32.934
<v Speaker 1>America goes to sleep at night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried that they don't have healthcare </v>

7
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>coverage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>and cannot get ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:47.661
<v Speaker 1>how do we ensure that every kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God given potential is fulfilled?</v>

10
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.343
<v Speaker 1>How do we use the power of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>collective intellect as a more powerful </v>

11
00:00:55.381 --> 00:00:56.214
<v Speaker 1>tool than the power of our bombs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do we do it in a way that </v>

12
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>promotes democracy and human rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the world?</v>

13
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how do we take American ingenuity </v>

14
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and turn it for good in other parts in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world?</v>

15
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>what I get to do is work out everyday at</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing the world,</v>

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>being part of changing the course of </v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

18
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>of being able to make the wind that </v>
<v Speaker 1>blows over our people,</v>

19
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>blow a lot more gently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>and at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving in a direction that,</v>

21
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.323
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says to me personally that I have left </v>

22
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>the world a better off today than it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>

23
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change isn't always easy and it doesn't </v>

24
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:51.060
<v Speaker 1>always happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I wonder,</v>

25
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>did I leave the world better off today </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it was yesterday?</v>

26
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

27
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.683
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but bringing people together in common </v>

28
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:01.944
<v Speaker 1>cause is a great challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also great opportunity to do great </v>

29
00:02:06.571 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.013
<v Speaker 1>and obviously that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a struggle because we don't all </v>

31
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>come from the same experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from the same backgrounds,</v>

32
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.123
<v Speaker 1>look at everything the same way even </v>
<v Speaker 1>when sometimes we believe in a common </v>

33
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.970
<v Speaker 1>goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have different views as to how we</v>

34
00:02:26.971 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>achieve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

35
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a struggle.</v>

36
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>It's a struggle from someone who grew up</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>

37
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.163
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be in an institution which getting </v>

38
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>there often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 1>requires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising money,</v>

41
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

42
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding very expensive elections in </v>

43
00:02:49.471 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>media markets that are very expensive so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can get your message so that of</v>

44
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.073
<v Speaker 1>what you want to do so that you can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected to then do the things that will </v>

45
00:02:59.111 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>change the course of events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

46
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a struggle.</v>

47
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm best known for,</v>

48
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

49
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>trying to give Hispanic Americans a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place at the table,</v>

50
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.470
<v Speaker 1>particularly as it relates to a,</v>

51
00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.250
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

52
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>being part of the political space in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

53
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowering seeking to empower Latino's,</v>

54
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:31.530
<v Speaker 1>which I've done from my home state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

55
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>had been involved with nationally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.980
<v Speaker 1>and also riveting attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>within the fastest part of America's </v>
<v Speaker 1>population growth and the largest single</v>

58
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>minority that there is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>

59
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>not just for that community itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the broader American community.</v>

60
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a community that is a younger by</v>

61
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:58.970
<v Speaker 1>a decade and the rest of the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>and so as the nation grays and grows </v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

63
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.183
<v Speaker 1>it will increasingly look to members of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this community within the American </v>

64
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:11.701
<v Speaker 1>family for the quality of their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of us will be washing a surgeons,</v>

65
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kitchen knife in a,</v>

66
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a restaurant.</v>

67
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And another one of us will be holding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeon's knife in an operating room and</v>

68
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.334
<v Speaker 1>how well educated and trained that </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual will be will be increasingly </v>

69
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>important to those who are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>his or her patients.</v>

70
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And so if we are younger by a decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.553
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be about 25 percent of all of </v>

72
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:38.260
<v Speaker 1>the nations schoolchildren within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next 20 years,</v>

73
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>it means the educational future of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation is also at stake in large part to</v>

74
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:45.640
<v Speaker 1>this community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:04:45.641 --> 00:04:46.474
<v Speaker 1>and so how well educated that a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American society is going to be </v>

76
00:04:49.991 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 1>important for the nations competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

77
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>So having Hispanic Americans play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant role in having policy issues</v>

78
00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>that affect the quality of their lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in return,</v>

79
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of opportunity in America is</v>

80
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>something that I think that not only </v>
<v Speaker 1>have I been doing,</v>

81
00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but that I am known for in terms of part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my work.</v>

82
00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It would be that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>it is a sleeping giant that I think is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about to awaken and needs to wake up and</v>

84
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:30.814
<v Speaker 1>needs to wake up by using its electoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>power in a way that can decide the </v>

85
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>course of events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>immediately in our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the longterm,</v>

87
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.433
<v Speaker 1>I think the community has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformational opportunity to change </v>

88
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and impact not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

89
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>who the next president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States will be,</v>

90
00:05:55.541 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>which in and of itself will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant.</v>

91
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.573
<v Speaker 1>But where public policy will head when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have 17 million Latinos in the </v>

92
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.753
<v Speaker 1>who are eligible to vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you see where they're located </v>

94
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>in the states that are critical for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>electoral victory,</v>

95
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>for the next president of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

96
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Speaker 1>you have an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>to have a transformational change by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>use of your power,</v>

98
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.583
<v Speaker 1>our challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my message to the community that would </v>

99
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:27.224
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to use that power because </v>

100
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 1>that power ultimately comes back in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>things that you care about,</v>

101
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 1>for the future of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future of the community that you</v>

102
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.854
<v Speaker 1>live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nation that you call your own </v>

103
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Giotto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latina decade,</v>

104
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.890

<v Speaker 1>Doria that allow both the full tool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that device in a bladed that acc at the </v>

106
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>median is the baton.</v>

107
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>This gang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment to voiding the city kimball,</v>

108

<v Speaker 1>internacional.</v>

111
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>They get pulled a muscle or rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking,</v>

112
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:19.403
<v Speaker 1>get to the.</v>

113

<v Speaker 1>good parents like the name of etc.</v>

119
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.093
<v Speaker 1>evaporated fairly sudden news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different in the house of </v>

120
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:16.260
<v Speaker 1>representatives and institution of 435 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that is incredibly diverse.</v>

121
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gettIng uh,</v>

122
00:08:19.410 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>enough people in common cause 218 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pass anything is a real challenge.</v>

123
00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:27.300
<v Speaker 1>But particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the big differences between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and the senate as if you're in the</v>

125
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:36.411
<v Speaker 1>house of representatives and if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to be in the minority party,</v>

126
00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:41.190
<v Speaker 1>whenever that might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's republicans or democrats in</v>

127
00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:42.024
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost an abject minority because </v>

128
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.513
<v Speaker 1>the rules of the house control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process in such a way that the majority </v>

129
00:08:50.461 --> 00:08:51.294
<v Speaker 1>largely controls everything primarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a traffic cop call that rules </v>

130
00:08:54.211 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>committee.</v>

131
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that committee,</v>

132
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>which is a super majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of controls,</v>

133
00:08:59.281 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>what gets to the floor of the house of </v>
<v Speaker 1>representatives under what way?</v>

134
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>It's debated how much time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what amendments and all that.</v>

135
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

136
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.543
<v Speaker 1>and it can even change the legislation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you may have gotten out of another </v>

137
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:11.570
<v Speaker 1>committee that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>ultimately comes before the rules </v>
<v Speaker 1>committee.</v>

139
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.240
<v Speaker 1>The rules committee can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

140
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:18.480
<v Speaker 1>we're going to rewrite this bill and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to send it to the floor in a</v>

141
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the house of representatives,</v>

142
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.633
<v Speaker 1>not only is getting common cause and </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more difficult challenge because </v>

143
00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:27.534
<v Speaker 1>you knew 218 votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have the differences </v>

144
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:32.214
<v Speaker 1>between a majority and a minority with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the minority facing enormous hurdles to </v>

145
00:09:37.471 --> 00:09:42.471
<v Speaker 1>have its views or propositions be voted </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in the United States senate.</v>

146
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.570
<v Speaker 1>Not only of course is that a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution,</v>

147
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.404
<v Speaker 1>100 members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the power is given to an individual </v>

148
00:09:49.831 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 1>senator can make a minority senator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 1>one in which they play a majority role.</v>

150
00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because there is no traffic cop,</v>

151
00:10:01.171 --> 00:10:02.004
<v Speaker 1>the rules committee and so much moves in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the senate by what we call unanimous </v>

152
00:10:05.551 --> 00:10:06.384
<v Speaker 1>consent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just means that there has to be </v>

153
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:10.680
<v Speaker 1>unanimity among 100 members to let </v>
<v Speaker 1>something move forward.</v>

154
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.723
<v Speaker 1>And one senator can get up and object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had an early experience of that </v>

155
00:10:14.971 --> 00:10:15.804
<v Speaker 1>upon coming to the senate where there </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a legislation in the final days of </v>

156
00:10:20.221 --> 00:10:21.054
<v Speaker 1>the republican senate in 2006 that </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to change and authorize a Ryan </v>

157
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:30.480
<v Speaker 1>White funding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is important about aids prevention</v>

158
00:10:30.481 --> 00:10:31.314
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

160
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.293
<v Speaker 1>how we help the hiv affected community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was going to be done in such a </v>

161
00:10:37.081 --> 00:10:40.680
<v Speaker 1>way that clearly would have hurt my </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of New Jersey,</v>

162
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in ways that I could not tolerate on </v>

163
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 1>behalf of that community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was my power then as a minor part</v>

164
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 1>of the minority power party.</v>

165
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.273
<v Speaker 1>But as an individual senator to say I </v>
<v Speaker 1>object and by my objections stopping a </v>

166
00:10:56.161 --> 00:11:01.161
<v Speaker 1>process that until a negotiation took </v>
<v Speaker 1>place with me that changed the course of</v>

167
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:02.664
<v Speaker 1>events at made that legislation in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>reauthorization far more acceptable to </v>

168
00:11:08.011 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 1>those people who have suffered with hiv </v>
<v Speaker 1>aids in my home state of New Jersey.</v>

169
00:11:12.401 --> 00:11:13.234
<v Speaker 1>And it's an example of how even a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of the minority party in the </v>

170
00:11:17.491 --> 00:11:18.324
<v Speaker 1>senate can have a disproportionate </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to affect the course of </v>

171
00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:24.780
<v Speaker 1>events than a minority member of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

172
00:11:24.781 --> 00:11:25.614
<v Speaker 1>Of representatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not as many as I'd like since it </v>

173
00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:39.460
<v Speaker 1>is one of those books that inspire me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

174
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but there are moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are moments.</v>

175
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.793
<v Speaker 1>I think there are moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are the party of the </v>

176
00:11:47.011 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>president and are willing to buck the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

177
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>

178
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

179
00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:56.003
<v Speaker 1>a profile encouraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are those people who are willing </v>

180
00:11:58.990 --> 00:11:59.823
<v Speaker 1>to speak out against a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might be seen as the popular view </v>

181
00:12:06.281 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>in a country or among their colleagues.</v>

182
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And I know last year I know I was only </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of 12 members,</v>

183
00:12:12.731 --> 00:12:15.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to vote to transition out of Iraq,</v>

184
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of 100 member body and,</v>

185
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

186
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of,</v>

187
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.620
<v Speaker 1>those individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

189
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:31.350
<v Speaker 1>that was not an easy choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they felt it was the right choice.</v>

190
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there are moments of that,</v>

191
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

192
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:38.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>I think though that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

194
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:46.950
<v Speaker 1>to say what is one person's profile </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage,</v>

195
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:48.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may not be seen as significant as </v>

196
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:50.921
<v Speaker 1>another's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

197
00:12:50.921 --> 00:12:52.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

198
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:57.020
<v Speaker 1>I think passage from profiles and </v>
<v Speaker 1>courage that speaks to this is a,</v>

199
00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:00.190
<v Speaker 1>in a prologue which says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in whatever arena of life what meets the</v>

200
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:03.730
<v Speaker 1>challenge of courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter the sacrifices they face,</v>

201
00:13:03.731 --> 00:13:07.150
<v Speaker 1>if they follow their conscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loss of their friends,</v>

202
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:09.040
<v Speaker 1>their fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their contentment,</v>

203
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:09.933
<v Speaker 1>even the esteem of their fellow man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each person must decide for themselves </v>

204
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.063
<v Speaker 1>the course they will follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stories of past courage they can </v>

205
00:13:17.771 --> 00:13:19.900
<v Speaker 1>teach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can offer hope,</v>

206
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:21.003
<v Speaker 1>they can provide inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they cannot provide courage itself </v>

207
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.503
<v Speaker 1>for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each person must look into their own </v>

208
00:13:27.161 --> 00:13:27.994
<v Speaker 1>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think there are members of the </v>

209
00:13:29.981 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 1>senate in their own ways on different </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues who,</v>

210
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:33.934
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from time to time look into their own </v>

211
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:38.980
<v Speaker 1>soul and act in a way that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous.</v>
