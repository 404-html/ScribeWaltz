<v Speaker 1>They're waiting to be explored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite things,</v>

2
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't really favorite themes.</v>

3
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>They sort of compulsive themes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last year I think obviously a lot about</v>

4
00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anybody who thinks thinks about global</v>

5
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.380
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>last year I found that every poem that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to write turned out to be a</v>

7
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:43.931
<v Speaker 1>pound for garb about global warming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was not a healthy situation.</v>

8
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>I realized I could only write about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

9
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>so I had to forcibly move myself away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that theme back to other themes.</v>

10
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>Each poem has an essence of colonel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every work of art as Peter Brook,</v>

11
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:00.530
<v Speaker 1>the Great Theater director pointed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

12
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 1>that you can reduce any work of art to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one kernel of force of colon</v>

13
00:01:08.031 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if every poem is trying to use that</v>

14
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>same kernel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to become repetitive</v>

15
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>and become dull.</v>
