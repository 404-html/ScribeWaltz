1
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>I think fashion is reached a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>critical mass,</v>

2
00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>literally dumb ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taste is no longer a privilege,</v>

4
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>like in home design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get fantastic looking things for</v>

5
00:00:19.491 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>your home and for you to wear and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to pay a premium for that.</v>

6
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that's great that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that great design,</v>

7
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>great fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>is it all price points now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's reached all levels of</v>

9
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of egalitarian idea</v>

10
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>that fashion is no longer for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged few,</v>

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

12
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resonates in my democratic year with a</v>

13
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>nice ring to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that fashion is big business.</v>

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not kid ourselves when you open up</v>

15
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>fashion magazines and see the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising and the amount of money</v>

16
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>that's put in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women buy clothes and continue to buy</v>

17
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 1>and men are getting very involved much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

19
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>The men's side of fashion is growing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large rate as well.</v>

20
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cosmetics business,</v>

21
00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of beauty which is an extension</v>

22
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 1>of fashion in a way in how you look and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you are,</v>

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and the way we exercise,</v>

24
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 1>all of that has to do with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of who we are.</v>

25
00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>A slight cult of youthfulness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to stay young.</v>

26
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that has made fashion become an</v>
<v Speaker 1>even larger,</v>

27
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>more important role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>because if we dress like a ladies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to feel and look like old</v>

29
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So keeping on,</v>

30
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>keeping fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking beautiful,</v>

31
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>looking young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>staying young,</v>

32
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>keeping current with what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trends,</v>

33
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>those are all part of a kind of cultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift and change were,</v>

34
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 is the new 50 slash 50 is the new 60,</v>

35
00:01:43.581 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's living a lot longer,</v>

36
00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.260
<v Speaker 1>living a lot healthier and everyone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to,</v>

37
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I think tap into dressing in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they never were before.</v>

38
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>And the options are huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't just have to have a chanel</v>

39
00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:57.974
<v Speaker 1>suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

40
00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you can do it any way you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fashion has become fun.</v>

42
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.860
<v Speaker 1>It's become acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accessible,</v>

43
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it means that good taste,</v>

44
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone can have it.</v>

45
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I think some of them are probably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little arrogant and snotty about it and</v>

46
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>would love to see it on five foot 11</v>
<v Speaker 1>skinny,</v>

47
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>beautiful model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>but I can't help but think of Karl</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lagerfeld who's so smart in and his,</v>

49
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvention of what Coco Chanel did and</v>

50
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>liberating women from corsetry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving them a loose shape,</v>

51
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>jackets and sweaters and all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we take for granted now that</v>

52
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:43.050
<v Speaker 1>women never wore a before she came along</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of liberate us from the Corset</v>

53
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.943
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 1>of the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admire Karl Lagerfeld's ability to</v>

55
00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>continually reinvent that wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of his great successes</v>

56
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>is that he accepts the modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's going to be a jersey girl with a</v>

57
00:02:56.941 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>really expensive handbag,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic.</v>

58
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a Russian oligarchs wife who's</v>

59
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>got gazillion rubles and she can spend</v>
<v Speaker 1>it on slightly gaudy taste,</v>

60
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>why not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>if it's the women of oil barons that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>now a dictate and pay for couture,</v>

62
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a book,</v>

63
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>I think if to say no to that is folly.</v>

64
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>You can't change the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

65
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>I think his philosophy's always been and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to his great credit,</v>

66
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>embrace what's new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what's interesting about it.</v>

67
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Take from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from that.</v>

68
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Keep your ears open and watch what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>

69
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't be too arrogant or complacent</v>

70
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think designers have to keep their</v>

71
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:40.331
<v Speaker 1>ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>everyone gets tired and complacent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks that what they do,</v>

73
00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose,</v>

74
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.120
<v Speaker 1>they lose touch with what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he would be someone that one</v>

75
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.430
<v Speaker 1>could channel to really appreciate no</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter who's wearing it,</v>

76
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>listen to their customer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're buying it.</v>

77
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:54.124
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

78
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.630
<v Speaker 1>you're making clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not reinventing a,</v>

79
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>the cure for life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're making clothing.</v>

80
00:03:59.321 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>So whoever would work can wear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does where it.</v>

81
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how lucky,</v>

82
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that someone wants to buy what you've</v>

83
00:04:06.311 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>designed or made.</v>
