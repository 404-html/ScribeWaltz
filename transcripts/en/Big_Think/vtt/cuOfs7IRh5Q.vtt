1
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>So there's a great book by Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waltzer called what it means to be an</v>

2
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that he says is</v>

3
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>that for centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really from the time of the Greeks,</v>

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>political philosophers believed that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only way to have diversity in a society</v>

5
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>was for it to be an empire or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>

6
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted a democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had to be homogenous.</v>

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>One ethnic group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one racial group,</v>

8
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>and especially one religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he ends that section and he</v>

9
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>begins the next section with the line</v>
<v Speaker 1>until the United States of America.</v>

10
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>We are the first mass scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religiously diverse democracy,</v>

11
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.720
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a remarkable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when a religiously diverse democracy</v>

12
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>works well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sight to behold.</v>

13
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>You have low levels of prejudice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have strong social cohesion,</v>

14
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>you have high levels of social capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have respect for different identity</v>

15
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the narrative of a diverse</v>

16
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.040
<v Speaker 1>society that binds that society with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of unity.</v>

17
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of what interfaith youth core</v>
<v Speaker 1>is about is helping America continue to</v>

18
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>be a religiously diverse democracy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all ought to be proud of.</v>

19
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 1>What strikes me most about the founding</v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers and a set of important figures</v>

20
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 1>before the founding fathers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Roger Williams and the</v>

21
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>people who drafted the flushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>remonstrance,</v>

22
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:26.781
<v Speaker 1>that's 140 years before the founding</v>
<v Speaker 1>fathers was that this set of characters</v>

23
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.540
<v Speaker 1>imagined a religiously diverse democracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a big part of that is the separation</v>

24
00:01:32.851 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>of church and state and as a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that of course is to protect the state</v>

25
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>from the church and to protect religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities from undue interference by</v>

26
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:46.611
<v Speaker 1>the state and it is also significantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the welcoming of contributions</v>

27
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>from diverse religious communities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not like the founding fathers</v>

28
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:57.051
<v Speaker 1>were principally very devout people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they recognize the importance of the</v>

29
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>civic contributions of religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities and they certainly wanted</v>

30
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>those communities to flourish.</v>

31
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you a couple of examples of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

32
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>So Benjamin Franklin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he lived in Philadelphia,</v>

33
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>made proactive donations to the building</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds of every religious community that</v>

34
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>he could find in Philadelphia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different communities of Christians,</v>

35
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>a Jewish community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he built a hall,</v>

36
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.130
<v Speaker 1>said the pulpit of this hall will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>open to the preaching of anybody.</v>

37
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>If the grand mufti of Constantinople</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to send somebody preaching about</v>

38
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pulpit is here for his service,</v>

39
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not just freedom of religion,</v>

40
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>that's welcoming the contributions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse religious communities.</v>

41
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>George Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a Jewish leader in the late 18th</v>

42
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>century says to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen to,</v>

43
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>to my community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us Jews now that we have a new</v>

44
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a constitution,</v>

45
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:55.260
<v Speaker 1>and you are the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And George Washington writes in a famous</v>

46
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>document in American history called a</v>
<v Speaker 1>letter to the Hebrew congregation of</v>

47
00:02:58.681 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Newport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhode Island.</v>

48
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>He writes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this government will give to bigotry,</v>

49
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>no sanction and to persecution.</v>

50
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>No assistance made the children of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock of Abraham sit and safety under</v>

51
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>their own vine and fig and let there be</v>
<v Speaker 1>none to make them afraid.</v>

52
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>So there is this sense that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different religious communities are</v>

53
00:03:16.811 --> 00:03:21.811
<v Speaker 1>going to help make up the civil society</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the United States of America.</v>

54
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I think about it as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a potluck nation.</v>

55
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a play on a,</v>

56
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.600
<v Speaker 1>on the term melting pot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and what I don't like about the melting</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot is obviously this notion that,</v>

58
00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>that you have to kind of melt away your</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity or your distinctiveness.</v>

59
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>I think what makes America strong is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that different communities melt away</v>

60
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>their identities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's that they bring their identities to</v>

61
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>the common table in the way we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a potluck,</v>

62
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a potluck is boring if everybody</v>

63
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>brings wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bread and peanut butter.</v>

64
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.430
<v Speaker 1>A potluck is wonderful and nutritious</v>
<v Speaker 1>and festive when people bring the</v>

65
00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>various dishes that are distinctive to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their identity.</v>

66
00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>That's how I think about interfaith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is a variety of communities.</v>

67
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>A variety of orientations around</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

68
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.450
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from atheist to Zoroastrians,</v>

69
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>are contributing the best of who they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are for the comments.</v>

70
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>If different communities don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute,</v>

71
00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>the nation doesn't feast.</v>
