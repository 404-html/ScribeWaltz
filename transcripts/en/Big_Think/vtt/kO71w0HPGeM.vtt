1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been very,</v>

2
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 1>very involved with star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I first came because the mission</v>

4
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>there was to transform it from a tabloid</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a glossy magazine,</v>

5
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>which is totally necessary because after</v>
<v Speaker 1>us came out,</v>

6
00:00:24.091 --> 00:00:29.091
<v Speaker 1>it really changed the landscape of</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity reporting and tabloids as</v>

7
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>we're vulnerable because as newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people aren't for a long time,</v>

8
00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>haven't been reading newspapers and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>trend has been continuing and tablets</v>

9
00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>are really a newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

10
00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>star need to star needed to get a</v>

11
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>younger audience and needed to go more</v>
<v Speaker 1>upscale in order to attract advertising,</v>

12
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>which it couldn't carry is a tabloid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

13
00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American media decided that they were</v>

14
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>going to need this transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never been done before and Anna,</v>

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>it's never going to be done again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no other tablet that really is</v>

16
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was a real challenge.</v>

17
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>But I was very interested in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge and I came in and we did that</v>

18
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>and it took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say it took a good four years to</v>

19
00:01:12.031 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>really get accepted.</v>

20
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It's only been in the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this last year that I feel we've really</v>

21
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>patched past the tipping point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've gained this whole new younger</v>

22
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the advertisers to except the</v>

23
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:28.491
<v Speaker 1>magazine and advertising's up 26%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really in the last year I've</v>

24
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>been able even know I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I the other magazine I've been fairly</v>

25
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>involved with for a while it's shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really needed to also</v>

26
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a couple of years ago it brought in</v>

27
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:44.511
<v Speaker 1>a new editor and you creative director</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we redesigned and and read is we re</v>

28
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of not just did a physical</v>

29
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>redesigned but kind of really reformat</v>
<v Speaker 1>it the way we were presenting the</v>

30
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>editorial so and the text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

31
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually worked out very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

32
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>They're having their best year ever now</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

33
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until this last year I really didn't</v>

34
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>get a chance to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to oversee and focus on any other</v>

35
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>magazines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now because star has had that</v>

36
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>tipping point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to pull back from it and</v>

37
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>not be so involved in the day to day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been much more involved with,</v>

38
00:02:16.471 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm working on country weekly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also needed to be redesigned.</v>

39
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't have updated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>it's fun magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural health,</v>

41
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>men's fitness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even getting a little bit involved</v>

42
00:02:29.101 --> 00:02:32.580
<v Speaker 1>with the myth that the men's muscle</v>
<v Speaker 1>titles,</v>

43
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>which is very brand new to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

44
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>and then I work a lot also on doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>still a lot of the marketing and</v>

45
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 1>advertising</v>

46
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.350
<v Speaker 2>and working with publishers.</v>
