1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.730
<v Speaker 2>as an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm such an advocate for everyone to</v>

3
00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 2>think like an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you want to start your own</v>

4
00:00:12.731 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 2>business or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly helpful no matter what,</v>

5
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.730
<v Speaker 2>and so thinking like an entrepreneur</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of organizations or if you are</v>

6
00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 2>starting your own business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always say,</v>

7
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 2>I love to tell the people around me to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

8
00:00:26.231 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 2>Close Your eyes and take a minute and</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about how you would be doing your</v>

9
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>job if nobody showed you how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what surfaces?</v>

10
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 2>Because if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all on autopilot.</v>

11
00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 2>We're doing things the way either</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else showed us how to do it or</v>

12
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 2>we saw and learned from watching and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

13
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Change only happens when you do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>different than everybody else.</v>

14
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 2>So all the time I put myself through</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental exercises where I'm like,</v>

15
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know everybody's been doing it this</v>

16
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 2>way for a really long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is that the best way?</v>

17
00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 2>And I just see what comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I also come across ideas and inventions</v>

18
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>by going throughout my day looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>objects and saying,</v>

19
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 2>now how could that be better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why did the person who first created</v>

20
00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gum or the,</v>

21
00:01:15.221 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>which gum to me is so fascinating as</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who started a brand with $5,000,</v>

22
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 2>had to get an idea out there that didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>already exist.</v>

23
00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 2>The footless pantyhose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love to think about people who first</v>

24
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 2>introduced things to society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think about the guy who did gum.</v>

25
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to talk about like,</v>

26
00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.200
<v Speaker 2>can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought I had it tough.</v>

27
00:01:32.201 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 2>This guy's walking around going,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just chew it.</v>

28
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 2>You just put this wad in your mouth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people will probably like.</v>

29
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 2>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't swallow it.</v>

30
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You just chew it like that's a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard sell,</v>

31
00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at first.</v>

32
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that gum had no flavor and it</v>

33
00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 2>when it first came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's even crazier to me.</v>

34
00:01:47.651 --> 00:01:51.250
<v Speaker 2>But everything from the pencil to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fork to the chair,</v>

35
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:56.080
<v Speaker 2>we sit in to the car that we drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody originally had the thought and</v>

36
00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:59.860
<v Speaker 2>brought it forward to society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So get off autopilot,</v>

37
00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.230
<v Speaker 2>look at everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every object in your life,</v>

38
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.940
<v Speaker 2>the way that you do things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

39
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.280
<v Speaker 2>when you get up and brush your teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a better way to brush your</v>

40
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 2>teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it the right way to be doing it?</v>

41
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see what comes.</v>

42
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 2>So I started spanx with $5,000 in</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings from selling fax machines door</v>

43
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 2>to door in clearwater,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Florida for seven years.</v>

44
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 2>And I started it out of the back of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment.</v>

45
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 2>I had never taken a business class.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never worked in fashion or retail,</v>

46
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 2>but I was determined to make this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular undergarment for myself and</v>

47
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 2>women that filled a much needed void and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fashion.</v>

48
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 2>And it was the most challenging the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first two years to get it made because</v>

49
00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 2>no one took me seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard the word no for two solid years.</v>

50
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 2>I actually was calling all the hosiery</v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing plants and I ended up</v>

51
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 2>taking a week off of work and drove</v>
<v Speaker 2>around North Carolina in person begging</v>

52
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 2>these people to help make my prototype</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my idea.</v>

53
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 2>And so there were many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many times in those first two years when</v>

54
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 2>I wrote my own patent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Barnes and noble and bought a</v>

55
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 2>book on patents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And trademarks,</v>

56
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I created the packaging on my friend's</v>

57
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 2>computer after work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

58
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought of the name spanx sitting in</v>

59
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>traffic in Atlanta and went home and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trademarked it with my credit card for</v>

60
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>$150.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But all of this time I was doing it.</v>

61
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sharing it with anybody.</v>

62
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 2>None of my friends or family knew what</v>
<v Speaker 2>my idea was.</v>

63
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And that was really important to my</v>
<v Speaker 2>journey because I didn't want to share</v>

64
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:33.180
<v Speaker 2>the idea just for validation because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to make sure that I spent any</v>

65
00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 2>time I had pursuing it instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>defending it and explaining it.</v>

66
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 2>And I think so often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many times people have an amazing</v>

67
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:41.591
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>you have a million dollar or billion</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar idea in your life and the first</v>

69
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>thing you want to do is turn to your</v>
<v Speaker 2>right or left at work until a coworker</v>

70
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 2>tell your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell your husband,</v>

71
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 2>your wife and out of love and concern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a lot of feedback that stops</v>

72
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>that idea right in its moment that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

73
00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.800
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

74
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I wasn't using a support system</v>

75
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:07.501
<v Speaker 2>on those times that I had doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ended up really,</v>

76
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I listened to a lot of inspirational and</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivational lectures.</v>

77
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 2>And I would second guess myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put those tapes in,</v>

78
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>I drive around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to give myself pep talks.</v>

79
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:21.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a real back and forth for me to,</v>

80
00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:23.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep believing in myself when no one</v>

81
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 2>else was.</v>
