1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.990
<v Speaker 1>Cybersecurity is a unique challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>today because when we are so utterly</v>

2
00:00:03.991 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>dependent upon our digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>communications and our digital control</v>

3
00:00:07.711 --> 00:00:10.300
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so it's going to become evermore</v>

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>essential that we have the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide security that we're confident</v>

5
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge is if we were against</v>

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>doctor know or Mr big in a cave</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere,</v>

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>you could understand the threat and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could sort of limit the threat and the</v>

8
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>threat would have a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A predictable limitation and what they</v>

9
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to pick an avenue of</v>

10
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>approach and they'd have to go at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>avenue of approach because they can't do</v>

11
00:00:33.121 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>all things at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Cybersecurity,</v>

12
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>that's not the threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are some entities like that.</v>

13
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>There's some state sponsored entities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are focused on certain things,</v>

14
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>but the barrier to entry into the cyber</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is very low.</v>

15
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>You can get in your basement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your boxer shorts and you can have a</v>

16
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>computer and you can get into the game</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's sort of the idea of 10,000</v>

17
00:00:55.861 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>monkeys typing on 10,000 keyboards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's going to create a</v>

18
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>cybersecurity challenge and so and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly morphing and adapting,</v>

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>whereas the cybersecurity requirement is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect things so you essentially</v>

20
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>have to protect everything that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>value all the time.</v>

21
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>The people who want to attack that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack at their choosing wherever they</v>

22
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>want and constantly changed their</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks constantly.</v>

23
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Just like water goes against a damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just goes until it finds the weakest</v>

24
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At some point something happens,</v>

25
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>technology changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human error,</v>

26
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>technological glitch or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a good likelihood that they'll</v>

27
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>get in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you think about the</v>

28
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>cybersecurity problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I don't think will work</v>

29
00:01:40.321 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>is the Maginot line.</v>

30
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Maginot line was created by the</v>

31
00:01:43.471 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>French in the 19 thirties to prevent the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans from doing a repeat of the first</v>

32
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>world war and invading France from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

33
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>People think of it now is the stupidest</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing ever built,</v>

34
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really correct because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maginot line actually worked.</v>

35
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>The Germans did not invade across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>German French border.</v>

36
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is they went through Belgium.</v>

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>They still got into France and conquered</v>
<v Speaker 1>France and the summer 1940,</v>

38
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>so I think the lesson to be learned is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have to be defensive things set up</v>

39
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>as best we can for cybersecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to have to be this</v>

40
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>constantly adapting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly morphing defense-in-depth</v>

41
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>with some offense to with going out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out where the threats are</v>

42
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>arising and that that defense in depth</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that you can't have one line.</v>

43
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.070
<v Speaker 1>The government can't put a big wall up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody hides behind it.</v>

44
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>Nor do we want each organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each commercial firm or government</v>

45
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>organization to be an island under</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

46
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>just hoping that they are not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>weakest willdabeast in the herd and that</v>

47
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>the lines of get somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we really need is all of those</v>

48
00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>entities to be linked so they constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from one another.</v>

49
00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>If one suffers a breach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has to learn from it.</v>

50
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.250
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge is people are low.</v>

51
00:03:01.251 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>The share that information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

52
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>because commercially they might be hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>by reputation.</v>

53
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid that the more you share,</v>

54
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>the more you have the event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

55
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of your little island is not</v>

56
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:18.571
<v Speaker 1>completely separated your moat around it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has got linkages across it and you can</v>

57
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>be opened up more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to have to get a network</v>

58
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>to defense where every time something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens and we learned from it,</v>

59
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>the entire network learns immediately.</v>

60
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to have that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed because there will be breaches,</v>

61
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>there will be mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the organism,</v>

62
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotta learn.</v>

63
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have to be a lot like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human immune system.</v>

64
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.610
<v Speaker 1>The human immune system is extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>because about 10,000 times a day it gets</v>

65
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>attacked by something that could hurt</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human body,</v>

66
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>but as it responds and it sends out an</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibodies to it,</v>

67
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>it does it and it learns from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that has a breach one time.</v>

68
00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>It actually builds up antibodies against</v>
<v Speaker 1>that challenge and has them at the ready</v>

69
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>for the next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we build up immunity to</v>

70
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the human immune system is</v>

71
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>the way our cyber defense is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be,</v>

72
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>which means that it has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated.</v>
