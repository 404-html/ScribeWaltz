00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>The academy is a huge enterprise in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States there are 6,500</v>

2
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>institutions that do higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are public and private.</v>

3
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>There are community colleges to research</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities.</v>

4
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.940
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're large,</v>

5
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>they're small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're urban,</v>

6
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:30.321
<v Speaker 1>they're rural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the the university and college and</v>

7
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Community College,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Higher Education Complex in the</v>

8
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>United States is unbelievably diverse</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way that's one of its great</v>

9
00:00:39.241 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>strengths is because it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralized,</v>

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.371
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

11
00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:48.371
<v Speaker 1>It's highly competitive on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly cooperative on the other and it's</v>

12
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:54.681
<v Speaker 1>hard to think of any question to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a single answer for the entire</v>

13
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>complex realism of higher education that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that having been said,</v>

14
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>if I were to try to focus on one issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that loomed large across the entire</v>

15
00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>spectrum of the 6,500 schools that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>operating in higher education.</v>

16
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say that there is at this moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country which which has without</v>

17
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>question a higher education system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the envy of the world.</v>

18
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>There is in process a tectonic change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way our society views higher</v>

19
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>education and it is not for the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is bias and law judge,</v>

20
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.940
<v Speaker 1>a subliminal devaluation of higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>education even as we overtly as a</v>

21
00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>society say how important it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're disinvesting in it.</v>

22
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>We're beginning to treat it more as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>private good.</v>

23
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Then as a public good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and and this in the long term is is</v>

24
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.750
<v Speaker 1>quite a challenge to the higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>education establishment,</v>

25
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>but I went to school here in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

26
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>There was a New York state regents</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholarship that you could win as a,</v>

27
00:02:12.051 --> 00:02:17.051
<v Speaker 1>as a competitive prize that paid for</v>
<v Speaker 1>room board and tuition for you to go to</v>

28
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:22.491
<v Speaker 1>a private school and today the aid</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's given by New York state is,</v>

29
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>is a small fraction of the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attending anything but a public school.</v>

30
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's a small fraction of paying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost of attendance at one of the elite</v>

31
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>private colleges or universities of New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York state.</v>

32
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that is because what we expect</v>

33
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>from higher education has has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone up that that the cost of a</v>

34
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>private education has gone up greatly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

35
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's because the quality of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>being provided has gone up greatly.</v>

36
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>That the diversity of courses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

37
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ratio of faculty to students that we</v>

38
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>as a society have have not continued the</v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness we showed after World War</v>

39
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Two to invest heavily in that higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

40
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:15.950
<v Speaker 1>whether it be in the research side or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it available to students and,</v>

41
00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:20.951
<v Speaker 1>and that in the long term is a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake by public policy makers.</v>
