00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you need to think strategically about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you're going to organize,</v>

2
00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:14.150
<v Speaker 1>manage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lead the enterprise to enable,</v>

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and adaptive,</v>

4
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>resilient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 1>organization with high commitment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capacity to innovate and Change</v>

<v Speaker 1>Michael Beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor emeritus at the Harvard</v>

7
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Business School and Chairman of true</v>
<v Speaker 1>point</v>

8
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>leaders of these or of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations have made and those who</v>

9
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>aspire to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to build these firms need to make a</v>

10
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:42.241
<v Speaker 1>number of critical choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first and foremost choice is about</v>

11
00:00:42.581 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>what is the purpose of the organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.270
<v Speaker 1>is it to increase shareholder wealth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop there?</v>

13
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Or is it more than that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most high commitment,</v>

14
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:57.610
<v Speaker 1>high performance with high commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high performance organizations have a</v>

15
00:00:57.611 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>multistakeholder perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see their task as achieving</v>

16
00:01:02.321 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>profitability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very important.</v>

17
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It's essential for survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's essential for,</v>

18
00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for satisfying one of their critical</v>

19
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>constituencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the investor,</v>

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also aspire to,</v>

21
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create commitment,</v>

22
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>not only investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in customers and employees,</v>

23
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>importantly and employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the,</v>

24
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.070
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

25
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>and to be concerned about the community</v>
<v Speaker 1>and society as,</v>

26
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole.</v>

27
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

28
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the choice of purpose and the choice</v>

29
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

30
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of values that reflect that multi</v>

31
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 1>stakeholder perspective is an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an essential first step,</v>

32
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the development of affirm.</v>

33
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without that philosophy.</v>

34
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Without that viewpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>you can get human resource departments</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do all kinds of things with policies</v>

36
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>and practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will not succeed.</v>

37
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second important choice they make is</v>

38
00:01:56.261 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>about strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A high commitment,</v>

39
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>high performance organizations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by an increment,</v>

40
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 1>illogical incrementalism as uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

41
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my one researcher once called it</v>

42
00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.760
<v Speaker 1>logical incrementalism in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic evolution over time.</v>

43
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

44
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't strike out into areas that</v>

45
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>they are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have any capabilities.</v>

46
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Then they stretched their capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop their capabilities and they</v>

47
00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:30.511
<v Speaker 1>move into adjacent areas and grow that</v>
<v Speaker 1>way off core capabilities.</v>

48
00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Uli Packard again would be a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

49
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a core technology and test and</v>

50
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:41.491
<v Speaker 1>measurement led them to improve things</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the customer that led them to begin</v>

51
00:02:41.981 --> 00:02:45.700
<v Speaker 1>to develop computer computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities were,</v>

52
00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>information processing capabilities</v>

53
00:02:48.011 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>because that was part of building</v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

54
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 1>better tested measurement organizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they began to apply those same</v>

55
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>ideas in a newer of a ways into both the</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer business,</v>

56
00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>the server,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately,</v>

57
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the printing business,</v>

58
00:03:01.571 --> 00:03:02.910
<v Speaker 1>which was an offshoot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

59
00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>of the soda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole approach.</v>

60
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so an incremental,</v>

61
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incremental ism in their strategy.</v>

62
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>A strategy that both puts emphasis on</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation and on exploration.</v>

63
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems with companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail is either focused on exploitation.</v>

64
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Let's make the most money we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not worry about innovation and the</v>

65
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.040
<v Speaker 1>or they focused entirely on exploration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new technology,</v>

68
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.860
<v Speaker 1>but they don't focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

69
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.703
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

70
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 1>on exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore their profit margins go</v>

71
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:34.690
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

72
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>And eventually they are forced to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that are not,</v>

73
00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for them.</v>

74
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for the long run.</v>

75
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 1>The third element is risk management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen that in spades in,</v>

76
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>two Oh eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two Oh nine period,</v>

78
00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the economic,</v>

79
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the deepest recession we've had</v>

80
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.200
<v Speaker 1>since the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>firms at a high commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high performance organizations take very</v>

82
00:03:57.971 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>measured risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm saying they're not taking risks.</v>

83
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>They take measured risks and carefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>considered risks,</v>

84
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.640
<v Speaker 1>some characteristics of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

85
00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 1>then I found in found Hewlett Packard</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest airlines.</v>

86
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I just interviewed Gary Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of southwest airlines,</v>

87
00:04:12.341 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>and about six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine months ago.</v>

88
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

89
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are characterized by very careful</v>

90
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>management of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

91
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>HP had no debt ever other than short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term debt.</v>

92
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest airlines characterized by the</v>

93
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>no longterm debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

95
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>just to self financing idea here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in some industries,</v>

96
00:04:35.171 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 1>that's not entirely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

97
00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live as close to that set of ideas</v>

98
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>as you can.</v>
