1
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.920
<v Speaker 1>One of the concepts that comes up over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>

2
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Prolific creative minds that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed for the Tim Ferriss show or</v>

3
00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>for the book tools of titans is creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>empty space.</v>

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>And one of the guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh Waitzkin,</v>

5
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>who never does any media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I curse on this?</v>

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always texts me with profanity laden</v>

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>SMS is because I'm the only one who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull them out of his cave,</v>

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.951
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do media.</v>

9
00:00:31.951 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>But he is best known perhaps as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess prodigy.</v>

10
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And I'll explain why I put that in air</v>
<v Speaker 1>quotes besides how funny it looks on</v>

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>that form the basis or who formed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis for searching for Bobby Fischer,</v>

13
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>both the book and the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was very well known chess player and</v>

14
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>continues to be an incredible chess</v>
<v Speaker 1>player,</v>

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>but he has applied his learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework to more than chess.</v>

16
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So he was a world champion and touchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>push hands is the first black belt in</v>

17
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu under the phenol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the best of all time.</v>

18
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Marcelo Garcia who trains in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>City,</v>

19
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I think he's a nine time world champion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.851
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>he's now tackling paddle surfing and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>can apply to just about anything.</v>

22
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>He works with some of the top financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>minds in the world,</v>

23
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>hedge fund managers and beyond the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the best,</v>

24
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>top 1%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>

25
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.380
<v Speaker 1>What are the principles that he shares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is uh,</v>

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>creating empty space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivating empty space as a way of</v>

27
00:01:30.421 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are all tied together so much.</v>

28
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>And another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning the macro from the micro and</v>

29
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>then beginning with the end in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these all work together.</v>

30
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.050
<v Speaker 1>So I'll explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

31
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>the last two first Josh learned to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess,</v>

32
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:52.671
<v Speaker 1>or I should say more accurately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was coached by his first real coach in</v>

33
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>the opposite direction when compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most training and most chess books.</v>

34
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>He was taught in reverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

35
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 1>He began with the end game and with very</v>
<v Speaker 1>few pieces.</v>

36
00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So they cleared all the pieces off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board instead of starting with openings.</v>

37
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Meaning what do you do first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first five to 10 moves,</v>

38
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>start with the end game with king and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pawn versus king.</v>

39
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>What does this do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>this forces you to focus on principles</v>
<v Speaker 1>like opposition creating space,</v>

41
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zugzwang,</v>

42
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:31.551
<v Speaker 1>which is a principle of forcing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponent to do anything that will</v>

43
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>destroy their position or anything they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can possibly do,</v>

44
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:40.461
<v Speaker 1>well worse in their position and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of principles that you learn when</v>

45
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:42.660
<v Speaker 1>there's an empty board with a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces,</v>

46
00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish a few things.</v>

47
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are learning the macro,</v>

48
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>the principles that you can apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout the game of chess in almost</v>

49
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 1>any scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>through the micro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

51
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>this end game situation.</v>

52
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.930
<v Speaker 1>And these principles are adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become a machine that can bob and</v>

53
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>weave with the circumstances very</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively compared to that as josh</v>

54
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>would put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it if you're memorizing the</v>

55
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>openings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 1>And this might be like memorizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>recipes.</v>

57
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:15.830
<v Speaker 1>If you're learning to cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>you're effectively stealing the answers</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the teacher's guidebook to a test</v>

59
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 1>and you'll be able to beat your friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>for awhile and,</v>

60
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:25.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even be considered a pretty decent</v>

61
00:03:25.421 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>chess player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on a deep level,</v>

62
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand the game and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not,</v>

63
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 1>you'll hit a ceiling and you will never</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress past that.</v>

64
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>And you'll get beaten by really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>players so that can be applied to,</v>

65
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian Jujitsu,</v>

66
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Josh told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught me basically all of the most</v>

67
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>important principles of Jujitsu through</v>
<v Speaker 1>one move at the end game,</v>

68
00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>which is as a choke called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guillotine,</v>

69
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>which Marcelo was famous for.</v>

70
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>His version is called the Marcello teen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's effectively like this.</v>

71
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>You're choking someone's head here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a weird way of doing it where he</v>

72
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>puts his forum on top of your shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty wicked.</v>

73
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be put unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to that gym and,</v>

74
00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>and a experience that yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

75
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:06.460
<v Speaker 1>that can also be applied to many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other things.</v>

76
00:04:06.461 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to build a start up,</v>

77
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

78
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000
<v Speaker 1>this is a common trendy thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days and I think everybody should</v>

79
00:04:15.371 --> 00:04:16.910
<v Speaker 1>start a business at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

80
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but in the startup game in say Silicon</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valley where I live,</v>

81
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to go into the venture</v>
<v Speaker 1>backed world,</v>

82
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>well you and your founder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think a lot about the end game and</v>

83
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely have an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a working agreement,</v>

84
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a tentative agreement on what type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exit,</v>

85
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.980
<v Speaker 1>say acquisition offer is acceptable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

86
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>If those those end goal components</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't in place,</v>

87
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.050
<v Speaker 1>then it's just a slow motion train wreck</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting to happen.</v>

88
00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And how might you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to learn the macro from</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro,</v>

90
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>you could think about what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition agreement might look like.</v>

91
00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>So you could talk to lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a sample template agreement and look</v>

92
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>at the provisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the clauses,</v>

93
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>and then reverse engineer it so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're forming the company and when</v>

94
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:08.890
<v Speaker 1>you're hiring employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your decisions at that point make it</v>

95
00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:11.110
<v Speaker 1>possible to have that contract at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>

96
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>This is another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro,</v>

97
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a 10 20 page document,</v>
<v Speaker 1>macro building,</v>

98
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>a company that gets acquired by a much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much larger company.</v>

99
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that is learning the macro from the</v>

100
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>micro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

101
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>another example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because I brought up cooking would</v>

102
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>be saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing a recipe that involves two or</v>

103
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:37.291
<v Speaker 1>three primary techniques and perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>three to five primary ingredients that</v>

104
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>apply in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

105
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.300
<v Speaker 1>many different dishes.</v>

106
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>So you're learning principles of safe</v>
<v Speaker 1>flavor,</v>

107
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.821
<v Speaker 1>combination principles of using</v>
<v Speaker 1>convection versus shallow frying or saw</v>

108
00:05:50.591 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Tang versus steaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

109
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that apply across the board.</v>

110
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 1>And in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you do without a recipe,</v>

111
00:05:58.431 --> 00:06:00.750
<v Speaker 1>without a timer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>or I should say a meat thermometer or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

113
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>You're going to learn also to test the</v>
<v Speaker 1>food to know whether it has done or not.</v>

114
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>That then applies to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can do it just learning how to</v>

115
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:15.761
<v Speaker 1>make Harissa crab cakes with steam</v>
<v Speaker 1>Broccoli and I have no idea,</v>

116
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>say candied yams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

117
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's that.</v>

118
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Now none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were also talking about the end game,</v>

119
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 1>so we've covered that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating it.</v>

120
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.760
<v Speaker 1>We're cultivating empty spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of life.</v>

121
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>This is very important to Josh Waitzkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I mentioned.</v>

122
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to people like Paul</v>
<v Speaker 1>Graham who's the Co founder of y</v>

123
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>combinator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like the navy seals,</v>

124
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Harvard of startup accelerators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping it simple,</v>

125
00:06:41.731 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just call it that for now.</v>

126
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>Creating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are a creator,</v>

127
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 1>if you are a maker and not a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is important.</v>

128
00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>Creating three to five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is a decision.</v>

129
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a lot of really good</v>

130
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.310
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs start as a technician or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tactician.</v>

131
00:07:01.311 --> 00:07:02.780
<v Speaker 1>They're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at one thing.</v>

132
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Then they end up in a managerial role</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they hate.</v>

133
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.590
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean you have to stay there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see a lot of folks like Evan</v>

134
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Williams and others who then at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>point realize this and return to a more</v>

135
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:15.770
<v Speaker 1>product focused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if they are also the CEO making</v>

137
00:07:18.801 --> 00:07:22.160
<v Speaker 1>some high level 30,000 foot decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

138
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.920
<v Speaker 1>But if you are a maker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've decided to be a maker,</v>

139
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>if you just happen to be maker or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>creator,</v>

140
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 1>let's call it three to five hour</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninterrupted blocks of time are</v>

141
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 1>extremely critical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to connect the dots,</v>

142
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have the space to allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to have original ideas or at</v>

143
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>least our original combinations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

144
00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.360
<v Speaker 1>you really need to block out that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and protect it at least once a week.</v>

145
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 1>So in tools of titans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many people who do this.</v>

146
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:52.520
<v Speaker 1>We meet Seti for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a very,</v>

147
00:07:52.521 --> 00:07:54.360
<v Speaker 1>very successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

148
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 1>multi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multimillion dollar business that he</v>

149
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>built out of a blog he started a long</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago in college,</v>

150
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 1>which was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very niche.</v>

151
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:04.490
<v Speaker 1>And its focus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blocks out,</v>

152
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's every Wednesday for three</v>
<v Speaker 1>to five hours of time.</v>

153
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:11.800
<v Speaker 1>He will block it out for learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

154
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Noah Kagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another entrepreneur does the same</v>

155
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on Wednesdays for me,</v>

156
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>I have from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is pre lunch.</v>

157
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I have creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means writing,</v>

158
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>recording or some similar aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my mind,</v>

159
00:08:28.551 --> 00:08:32.160
<v Speaker 1>creating with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my skillset and my assets and a,</v>

160
00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>it is extremely important that I do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I'm barraged by inputs.</v>

161
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is true of Josh as well.</v>

162
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 1>First thing in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing journaling.</v>

163
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Reid Hoffman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaire go founder or founder of</v>

164
00:08:44.751 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same story.</v>

165
00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>He will plant a seed in his mind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>night before a problem.</v>

166
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:53.780
<v Speaker 1>He wants to solve a project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to think about improving</v>

167
00:08:53.781 --> 00:08:58.781
<v Speaker 1>perhaps and then waking up row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tabula Rasa,</v>

168
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.190
<v Speaker 1>complete blank slate immediately working</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that problem with journaling before</v>

169
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>any text messages before any email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why for instance,</v>

170
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't have email set up on my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not have mail set up on my iphone</v>

171
00:09:11.151 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and I did not get notifications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also put my phone on airplane mode for</v>

172
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:18.090
<v Speaker 1>a lot of reasons for the four hour body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explained some of the physical ones but</v>

173
00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>on to airplane mode when I go to bed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stays in airplane mode until I am</v>

174
00:09:22.591 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>done with my creation period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it comes on because as soon as</v>

175
00:09:27.541 --> 00:09:32.541
<v Speaker 1>you go into bullet dodging or like</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder woman bullet blocking mode with</v>

176
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone else's agenda for your time,</v>

177
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>which is very often the inbox or text</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages,</v>

178
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>you're Doa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd done your creativity is,</v>

179
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 1>is all for naught in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for,</v>

180
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many people who are say,</v>

181
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:52.260
<v Speaker 1>programming for musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for creative types,</v>

182
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.440
<v Speaker 1>slack in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to create slack.</v>

183
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 1>You have to create space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to create large,</v>

184
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.510
<v Speaker 1>uninterrupted blocks of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way to do that is to put it</v>

185
00:10:03.511 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>on your calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not on your calendar,</v>

186
00:10:05.641 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to put it in your calendar and</v>

187
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.630
<v Speaker 1>defend it just like you would anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
