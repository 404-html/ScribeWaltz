<v Speaker 1>Most amazing things happen when you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes to God.</v>

2
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>The most unexpected things happen when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say yes to God.</v>

3
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Somebody asked me if I could boil down</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of my Christian faith into one word,</v>

4
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>and that word for me is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it was the word</v>

5
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>surrender or just in really simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>

6
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's saying yes to God.</v>

7
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>It's saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>I believe God that you probably know</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's best from our life for my life,</v>

9
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>more than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm willing to trust you with my</v>

10
00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>life and I'm willing to go along with</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I understand to be your plans for</v>

11
00:00:40.081 --> 00:00:43.230
<v Speaker 1>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in so doing it,</v>

12
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it causes you to have to say no to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

13
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Because honestly what gets in my way</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day is myself.</v>

14
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I call it in the book the Kingdom of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to be really honest,</v>

15
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.941
<v Speaker 1>the person I love the most is myself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I like most people and eager to</v>

16
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>make the world revolve around me.</v>

17
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I want my comfort,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my convenience.</v>

18
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>I want you to see life from my point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

19
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>I want you to think I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to like the way I do things.</v>

20
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So it's we're pretty self centered</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures,</v>

21
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to say yes to God means in many ways</v>

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.730
<v Speaker 1>saying no to myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>in I'm a real practical way that I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of that is in,</v>

24
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>in a marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>my husband and I both are self centered</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

26
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we love ourselves more than even we love</v>

27
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>each other unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes in an argument or a</v>

28
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>potential argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will want him to look at life through</v>

29
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>my set of lenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want him to see a situation from my</v>

30
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:41.130
<v Speaker 1>point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if he doesn't,</v>

31
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.860
<v Speaker 1>it's really easy to get offended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get wounded,</v>

32
00:01:43.861 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>to get hurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get bitter,</v>

33
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.440
<v Speaker 1>to surrender to God is to take that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of analogy that I'm saying in</v>

34
00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>marriage of saying to my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can either fight for all my ways,</v>

35
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>my thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my agenda,</v>

36
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.630
<v Speaker 1>my dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of run over his,</v>

37
00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:01.680
<v Speaker 1>or I can many times kind of just go</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with his will on a,</v>

38
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>on a bigger scale.</v>

39
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means to say yes to God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is my way of doing things,</v>

40
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>which frequently involves jealousy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>bitterness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

42
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>greed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are not God's ways.</v>

43
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Those don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those don't come from God.</v>

44
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So when I'm saying Yes to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm choosing his way,</v>

45
00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm choosing a response that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like something he would choose,</v>

46
00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>which would be love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

47
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>mercy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grace,</v>

48
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.160
<v Speaker 1>tenderness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving people second chances.</v>

49
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Those are all the things that come more</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a heart of God.</v>

50
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Then the ones that come from my heart.</v>
