00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.183
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is sort of impossible to define,</v>

3
00:00:09.821 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>but sociologists have tried and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition I think is really useful.</v>

4
00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:18.661
<v Speaker 1>Their definition is that coolness is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>measured positive rebellion against an</v>

5
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>illegitimate mainstream and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking of that all in one big pile is</v>

6
00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>a little bit complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you disentangle that it makes a</v>

7
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 1>lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a measured small rebellion.</v>

8
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>A little difference or distinction from</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream that is considered</v>

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>illegitimate or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coolness is a response to a mainstream.</v>

10
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>It is in many ways very similar to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociological definition of a cult.</v>

11
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>A cult is also a measured rebellion to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream that is considered</v>

12
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.860
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the best way to think about this</v>

13
00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 1>definition is to think about it through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lens of dress codes for high</v>

14
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.464
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Lots of high schoolers when they attend</v>
<v Speaker 1>a school that has addressed code,</v>

16
00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>they try to break from that code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only in ways that are measured and</v>

17
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

18
00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the dress code says you have to wear</v>

19
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>a coat with a tie and a button up shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they'll undo the tie a bit or wear</v>

20
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>a hat or undo their button up shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have measured,</v>

21
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>measured rebellions to that illegitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream,</v>

22
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's not cool to go to school naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not cool to go to school dressed in</v>

23
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:26.051
<v Speaker 1>some like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:26.051 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>like some sort of weird superhero for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tuesday.</v>

25
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>That's not a measured rebellion that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>outright rebellion and that is not</v>

26
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>considered cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need a measured rebellion,</v>

27
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but number two,</v>

28
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>the mainstream has to be considered</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate in the first place in order</v>

29
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>for the action to be considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

30
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>So in one study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these researchers is something really</v>

31
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>clever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They told a bunch of students who are,</v>

32
00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>who were departing from the mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dress code,</v>

33
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:56.611
<v Speaker 1>and in various ways they told them the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress code was a initiated to honor a</v>

34
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>high school graduate who had died</v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas in a war.</v>

35
00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Now suddenly that dress code wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>

36
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a completely legitimate way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to honor a fallen soldier and</v>

37
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 1>fewer students considered departing from</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dress code to be cool.</v>

38
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>So it's very important to think when</v>
<v Speaker 1>defining coolness that you need two</v>

39
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First you need to mainstream that is</v>

40
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>considered bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People need to agree that the mainstream</v>

41
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and two,</v>

42
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you need the rebellion to be positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and measured.</v>

43
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 1>It can't be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't be insane.</v>

44
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And when you have those two things</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

45
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.220
<v Speaker 1>you have cool the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>that which we consider cool and that</v>

46
00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:40.330
<v Speaker 1>which we consider cultish because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're relatively similar things.</v>

47
00:02:40.331 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>They're both departing from a mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>is essentially degree.</v>

48
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.140
<v Speaker 1>That culture all designed around this</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that most human beings are,</v>

49
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 1>most people in society don't get you or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't get this important thing.</v>

50
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>They're not religious enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not thoughtful enough.</v>

51
00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>They're not environmental enough has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be sort of the first principle of that</v>

52
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>cult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we reserve the word cult for</v>

53
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>essentially groups that are too far away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mainstream to be considered a</v>

54
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>measured rebellion from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that's exactly the right</v>

55
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:15.970
<v Speaker 1>way to think about coolness versus</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultish Nus,</v>

56
00:03:15.971 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 1>is that we're all part of cults were all</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of scent.</v>

57
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>We all disagree with some aspect of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream social or political thought,</v>

58
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>but the but whether or not other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider us cool there cultish</v>

59
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>essentially depends on whether they</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we are departing from that</v>

60
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>mainstream in a way that is measured and</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>
