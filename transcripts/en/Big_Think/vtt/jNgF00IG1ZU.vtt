1
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>Well in many of the animal groups that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at,</v>

2
00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned aunts and that was sort of</v>

3
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>special genetics of closeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can exclude them for now.</v>

4
00:00:16.551 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>But even when we look at selfish</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms like the fixed,</v>

5
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all locusts,</v>

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>they've evolved to lift with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly large troops and incredibly</v>

7
00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 1>large societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we humans happened,</v>

8
00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with food into these large cities.</v>

9
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:31.940
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not actually how we evolved.</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't have sort of specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules to optimize our situation here.</v>

11
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.360
<v Speaker 1>And further more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm mode of communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verbal communication and written</v>

13
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>communication is Israel to be slow</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the sort of the mass media</v>

14
00:00:45.861 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>and the all of the information that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have now.</v>

15
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>So there's some sort of fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.670
<v Speaker 1>challenges from a biological perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

17
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>to our societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 1>but what we do find is that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at learning how to behave in</v>

19
00:00:58.671 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>crates.</v>

20
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to take people from,</v>

21
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the central of America who've never been</v>

22
00:01:04.671 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>to a large city and pop them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of Manhattan,</v>

23
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>and alternately would this be a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural shock,</v>

24
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>we would actually be difficult for them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to behave within these crates.</v>

25
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 1>These are sort of learnt behaviors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sort of try things out and you</v>

26
00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>eventually kind of optimize how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>behave within these environments.</v>

27
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>And when we film and we track people</v>
<v Speaker 1>within crites,</v>

28
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>what sort of astonishes me is high</v>
<v Speaker 1>predictable from a statistical</v>

29
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how predictable crowds are.</v>

30
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And so each individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't necessarily predict whether</v>

31
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go left or right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when we start getting large groups</v>

32
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>of individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can predict properties like how many</v>

33
00:01:38.661 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>lanes will form or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what certain times a day,</v>

34
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will generally tend to move where.</v>

35
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can also make predictions about</v>

36
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>congestion in these environments and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

37
00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
