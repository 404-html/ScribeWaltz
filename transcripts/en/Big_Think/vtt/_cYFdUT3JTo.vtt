1
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I was raised in western Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am the child of two southerners and my</v>

2
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:21.191
<v Speaker 1>brother is also southern and my family</v>
<v Speaker 1>is southern way back before the</v>

3
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:25.100
<v Speaker 1>mayflower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was the only Yankee in the family</v>

4
00:00:25.101 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>for all generations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

5
00:00:27.891 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it definitely shaped me and my taste.</v>

6
00:00:30.531 --> 00:00:35.531
<v Speaker 1>I was the only little Yankee boy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked boiled peanuts and puts a salted</v>

7
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>peanuts in his coke and I'm liked grits</v>
<v Speaker 1>for breakfast.</v>

8
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southerners I think have,</v>

10
00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of traditions,</v>

11
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>one of which is a storytelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my southern relations when we get</v>

13
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's just one story after</v>

14
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after another,</v>

15
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>after another Thanksgiving when I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to visit my uncle Bob and aunt</v>

16
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:11.291
<v Speaker 1>render and all the cousins are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My stomach will hurt for days afterward</v>

17
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>because it's just so funny and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>all great storytellers and that's kind</v>

18
00:01:15.431 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>of how a family knowledge is passed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>from generation to generation is through</v>

19
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

22
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain level of dysfunction I</v>

23
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:34.171
<v Speaker 1>suppose that goes along with being part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a southern family secrets.</v>

24
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

25
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>and all these entanglements</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a,</v>

26
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a sort of gentility a courtesy.</v>

27
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very polite as a child.</v>

28
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm very well mannered as a child and</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>that's something else that you find</v>

30
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>probably it all started with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the astors,</v>

31
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the vanderbilts in New York City in</v>

32
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>the gilded age when society was</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed of layers upon layers upon</v>

33
00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>layers of etiquette.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't call somebody on the phone or</v>

35
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>you didn't text them and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go grab lunch.</v>

36
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>You would have your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your Person Send Your handwritten note</v>

37
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>over by carriage to your acquaintances</v>
<v Speaker 1>or your friend's house.</v>

38
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And they would receive the note and</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond in kind.</v>

39
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.880
<v Speaker 1>And they were just very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>many layers to society and how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaved and how we reacted</v>

41
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:46.341
<v Speaker 1>appropriately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now because New York is an,</v>

42
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.660
<v Speaker 1>always has been sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>the design geist from which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>everything radiates out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of the taste center and the</v>

45
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 1>design center of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.660
<v Speaker 1>and certainly was back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people emulated a,</v>

47
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>that stratified sort of concept of</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and um,</v>

48
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Chicago certainly did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>the big families began behaving as New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yorkers did and then as,</v>

50
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>as society spread west and happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the west coast as well and down south.</v>

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these manners,</v>

53
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them became of course outdated</v>

54
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life became more casual,</v>

55
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>casual Friday took over.</v>

56
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>But in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that these,</v>

57
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these manners still remain.</v>

58
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last Thanksgiving I was driving down a</v>

59
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>dirt road in Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that a red clay road?</v>

60
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Very Narrow d dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alabama,</v>

61
00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there are alligators in the</v>

62
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:57.730
<v Speaker 1>backyard and this big pickup truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Ford,</v>

63
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>f three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five was approaching me.</v>

64
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was me and my boyfriend and our</v>

65
00:04:03.701 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>two French bulldogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm thinking,</v>

66
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the part where the good old boy</v>

67
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>pulls the fags over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoots him and takes the dogs.</v>

68
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And so as this truck gets closer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>closer,</v>

69
00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it's got the big headlights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 1>on the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the driver is wearing camouflage,</v>

71
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.560
<v Speaker 1>including a camouflage hat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm thinking,</v>

72
00:04:23.561 --> 00:04:24.394
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

73
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>We're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just as we passed the trucker goes</v>

74
00:04:27.611 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and moves on.</v>

75
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>And I realized at that moment it was an</v>
<v Speaker 1>epiphany and I realized the last</v>

76
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>gentleman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the last true gentlemen,</v>

77
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>are the southern good old boys because</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mamas taught them to behave,</v>

78
00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes ma'am.</v>

79
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Thank you ma'am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Sir.</v>

80
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Thank you sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much how it is in the</v>

81
00:04:50.691 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I love the south.</v>

82
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this APP.</v>

83
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've inherited the um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.150
<v Speaker 1>the gothic literary sensibility sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost dated to Eudora welty and</v>

85
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>flannery o'connor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

86
00:05:13.211 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a south that doesn't quite exist as</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did.</v>

87
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Certainly there are pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>but because I didn't live in the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't experience,</v>

89
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish moss hanging off the trees</v>

90
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 1>and the sort of sweltering day days in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of drowsy,</v>

91
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.200
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the sort of sweet tea and um,</v>

92
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>I have a deep appreciation for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

93
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:42.440
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite authors is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carson mccullers and I think I'm,</v>

94
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.640
<v Speaker 1>the member of the wedding is just one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most perfect books ever written.</v>

95
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it really for me,</v>

96
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>captures that flavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you would call it a</v>

97
00:05:49.961 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>gothic southern novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly captures that dee dee</v>

98
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>just sort of almost the central south</v>
<v Speaker 1>and melancholy quality.</v>

99
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>So I myself don't think of myself as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern writer,</v>

100
00:06:02.511 --> 00:06:06.270
<v Speaker 1>although there are certain things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>me that are definitely a bitter</v>

101
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>definitely southern that are there as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of,</v>

102
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:10.491
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:12.560
<v Speaker 1>having southern parents and having</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern relatives.</v>
