1
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>And I fear that one consequences to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

2
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you got a call is that we are much less</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to intervene.</v>

3
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand there's just a shortage</v>

4
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>of troops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>everybody's preoccupied in Iraq or to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some extent,</v>

6
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>

8
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>no more stomach for military action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people have just had it with,</v>

10
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>with these adventures overseas want the</v>
<v Speaker 1>troops home and are not about to launch</v>

11
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>into another one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a third perspect the Bush</v>

13
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>administration is discredited the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of humanitarian intervention by</v>

14
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>trying to justify the Iraqi war after</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact as a humanitarian intervention</v>

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>when we all know that at the time it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly to have to find the</v>

16
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>nonexistent weapons of mass destruction</v>
<v Speaker 1>or was to attack the nonexistent links</v>

17
00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 1>with international terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>if we knew that there were no weapons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mass destruction,</v>

20
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>if it was clearly there was no all kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of connection,</v>

21
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush would not have gone in just because</v>

22
00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>Saddam was a tyrant.</v>

23
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after the fact by trying to justify</v>

24
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>the Iraq war as a humanitarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention,</v>

25
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>one that I don't think is justified</v>
<v Speaker 1>because bad is a tyrant,</v>

26
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>is Saddam was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was not the mass slaughter at the</v>

27
00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>time that would have justified him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manager intervention.</v>

28
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Bush has given the term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the concept of bad name.</v>

29
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really tired.</v>

30
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>What is I think a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:35.181
<v Speaker 1>a high minded concept with his fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>based political needs.</v>

32
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>And in the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's people say like the people</v>

33
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>in our four core paying the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the international community only</v>

35
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>willing to go into dark for with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>consent of the Sudanese government,</v>

36
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consent that has been held for a very</v>

37
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>it's because there is no more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:56.130
<v Speaker 1>stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no more capacity to,</v>

40
00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>to use military force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because people are not</v>

41
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Speaker 1>skeptical of this concept of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian or convention.</v>

42
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>And so in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are four or of eastern</v>

43
00:02:04.921 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Congo or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or others facing mass atrocities are</v>

44
00:02:08.101 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>very much paying the price of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>this cheap resorts to war and an effort</v>
<v Speaker 1>to justify it after the fact,</v>

46
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 1>as a humanitarian action.</v>
