00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:09.461 --> 00:00:13.120
<v Speaker 1>what I wish men knew about women that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

3
00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think men can do a better job of</v>

4
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 2>really listening to women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of times,</v>

5
00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an old Chinese saying called</v>

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Tang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm getting this right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it means to listen with your heart,</v>

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 2>your ear and your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think sometimes when people</v>

9
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

10
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.230
<v Speaker 2>they don't listen with their full</v>
<v Speaker 2>selves.</v>

11
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:34.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what emotional intelligence is</v>

12
00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think women give a lot of,</v>

13
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>set something like 70% of communication</v>

14
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 2>is nonverbal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can be completely irrational to</v>

15
00:00:42.801 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 2>some people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

16
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 2>tell me exactly what you want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if men would listen with</v>

17
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:47.751
<v Speaker 2>their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heart,</v>

18
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 2>and mind altogether,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they'd have better relationships</v>

19
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

20
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their partners,</v>

21
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>their mother's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever it is.</v>

22
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 2>But I also think that the world would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>a much better place.</v>
