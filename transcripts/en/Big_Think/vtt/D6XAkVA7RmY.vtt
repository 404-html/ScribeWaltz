1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.040
<v Speaker 1>We have found the Higgs Boson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the next question is,</v>

2
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.870
<v Speaker 1>what's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:06.871 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>the large Hadron Collider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this machine that is 20,</v>

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27 miles in circumference costing $10</v>

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>billion is big enough to create the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of particles.</v>

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>So the Higgs Boson in some sense is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last Hurrah for the old physics,</v>

7
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>the old physics or what is called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard model,</v>

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>which gives us quarks and electrons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new theory is going to take us into</v>

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know dark matter exists.</v>

10
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>Dark matter is invisible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I held it in my hand,</v>

11
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

12
00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>it would go right through my fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go right through the Rock,</v>

13
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>underneath my feet and go all the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>It would be reversed direction and come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from China all the way here to New</v>

15
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>York City and go back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dark matter has gravitational</v>

16
00:00:57.871 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>attraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is invisible and we are clueless</v>

17
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.130
<v Speaker 1>as to what dark matter really is.</v>

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>The leading candidate for dark matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

19
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>it's called the sparkle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This particle is the next octave of the</v>

20
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now look around you.</v>

21
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Everything around you we think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the lowest vibration of a</v>

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>vibrating string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lowest octave in some sense.</v>

23
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>But a string of course has higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>octaves,</v>

24
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>higher notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think that dark matter could in fact</v>

25
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>be nothing but a higher vibration of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>string.</v>

26
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>So we think that 23% of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

27
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>which is the dark matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is contribution to the universe,</v>

28
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>comes from a higher octave of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>string.</v>

29
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Now the standard model which we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ample verification of only represents 4%</v>

30
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the universe of atoms,</v>

31
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>protons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrons,</v>

32
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>neutrinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That universe only represents 4% of what</v>

33
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>23% is dark matter,</v>

34
00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>which we think is the next vibration up</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the string.</v>

35
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And then 73% of the universe is dark</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

36
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Dark energy is the energy of nothing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>they energy at the vacuum between two</v>

37
00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In outer space,</v>

38
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.130
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing except dark energy,</v>

39
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>dark energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pushing the galaxies apart.</v>

40
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>So when people say if the universe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>expanding,</v>

41
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.700
<v Speaker 1>they say two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's pushing the galaxies apart?</v>

42
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.320
<v Speaker 1>And what is the universe expanding into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 1>what's pushing the galaxies apart is</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark energy,</v>

44
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>the energy of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even vacuum has energy pushing the</v>

45
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 1>galaxies apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what is the universe expanding</v>

46
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>if the universe is a sphere of some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we live on the skin of the sphere</v>

48
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>and the sphere is expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a sphere expanding into?</v>

49
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a bubble of balloon expands</v>

50
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 1>into the third dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the people living on the</v>

51
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>balloon or two dimensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when our universe expands,</v>

52
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.740
<v Speaker 1>what does that expand into?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyperspace a dimension beyond what you</v>

53
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>can see and touch.</v>

54
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>string theory predicts that there are 11</v>

55
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>dimensions of hyperspace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're nothing but a soap bubble</v>

56
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>floating in a bubble bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was soap bubbles and so in some sense</v>

57
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>the multiverse can be likened to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble bath.</v>

58
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Our Universe is nothing but one bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are other bubbles.</v>

59
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>When two bubbles collide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could merge into a bigger bubble,</v>

60
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>which could be the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.711
<v Speaker 1>that's what probably the big bang is or</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a bubble vision than half and</v>

62
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>split off into two bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be the big bang or perhaps</v>

63
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the universe popped into existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of nothing.</v>

64
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>That is also a possibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the universe could essentially be</v>

65
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 1>nothingness which was unstable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>created a soap bubble.</v>

66
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>Now you may say to yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>that can't be right because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>violates the conservation of matter and</v>

68
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

69
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>How can you create a universe from</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing?</v>

70
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't calculate the total matter</v>

71
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is positive.</v>

72
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>If you calculated the total energy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>

73
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>it is negative because of gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gravity has negative energy.</v>

74
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>When you add the two together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you get?</v>

75
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it takes no energy to create a</v>

76
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universities are for free.</v>

77
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>A Universe is a free lunch and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>had assault.</v>

78
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can't be right because positive and</v>

79
00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>negative charges don't cancel out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

80
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>how can the university made out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing?</v>

81
00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you calculate the total amount of</v>

82
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>positive charge in the universe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>khaki,</v>

83
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 1>the total amount of negative charge in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe,</v>

84
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and you add it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you get?</v>

85
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe has zero charge.</v>

86
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about spin galaxies spin,</v>

87
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they spin in all directions.</v>

88
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>If you add up all the spins of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>galaxies,</v>

89
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>what do you get?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

90
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe has zero spin,</v>

91
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>zero charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and zero matter energy content.</v>

92
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.300
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is for free.</v>

93
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
