1
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>I think plants present an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people to look closely at something</v>

2
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>and get invested in something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly very much outside of themselves.</v>

3
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>Plants are not like us and the more you</v>
<v Speaker 1>study plants,</v>

4
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the more different and deep ways you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are not like us.</v>

5
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>All the important things that we do from</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we</v>

6
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>move around to how we reproduce to how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we</v>

7
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>react to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any human activity you could point to,</v>

8
00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

9
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.440
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see something very</v>
<v Speaker 1>different in plants and the more you</v>

10
00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>know about how plants function and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>more you watch them function and test</v>

11
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:08.860
<v Speaker 1>their functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more deeply you understand how</v>

12
00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>different they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's useful because I think</v>

13
00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>people have a need to transcend</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

14
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>And I know that when I get bogged down</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

15
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dysfunctionalities of how people</v>

16
00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>treat each other and conflicts between</v>
<v Speaker 1>men and women and,</v>

17
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>and money problems in science and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of thing that I can,</v>

18
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take some comfort and joy and</v>

19
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>transcending what seemed like very small</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale human noise.</v>

20
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>And look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the differences and a life form.</v>

21
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:50.710
<v Speaker 1>That's been successfully occupying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet for 400 million years,</v>

22
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.070
<v Speaker 1>so quite frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a lot of joy and comfort and</v>

23
00:01:56.831 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>happiness from considering these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

24
00:01:59.981 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the main reason to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>sciences,</v>

25
00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>that it feeds the soul.</v>

26
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I see this in students year after</v>

27
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the more you know about the world,</v>

28
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.951
<v Speaker 1>the more you feel like you're part of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like nothing else.</v>

29
00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you teach somebody not to just walk by a</v>

30
00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>tree but to look up at it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

31
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>that one's deciduous and that one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>evergreen and that one is going to lose</v>

32
00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>it sleeves this fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that one's going to stay green.</v>

33
00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>Just very basic things like that and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>see people sense of self and self esteem</v>

34
00:02:40.511 --> 00:02:45.511
<v Speaker 1>rise and all of a sudden they know</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about the world that they</v>

35
00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:50.671
<v Speaker 1>journey through and it makes them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit bigger as a person and that's</v>

36
00:02:55.781 --> 00:03:00.781
<v Speaker 1>really a wonderful thing to watch in</v>
<v Speaker 1>students and to be able to facilitate.</v>

37
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
<v Speaker 1>So I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should plant trees not to save trees.</v>

38
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:14.611
<v Speaker 1>I think planning a tree is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unlikely to be a method you use to</v>

39
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:22.921
<v Speaker 1>save yourself and to find meaning and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that will be with you and grow</v>

40
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.564
<v Speaker 1>with you</v>

41
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>and be something you can come back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>and contrast your own life with.</v>

42
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm very influenced by some research</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came out,</v>

43
00:03:39.651 --> 00:03:44.651
<v Speaker 1>I think in the eighties that compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>retention during learning.</v>

44
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>And I remember very strongly that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main result of that was the,</v>

45
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 1>the larger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of senses that you invoked if</v>

46
00:03:56.511 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you were touching something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were writing and listening and</v>

47
00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:04.280
<v Speaker 1>watching and even smelling something or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tasting,</v>

48
00:04:04.281 --> 00:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more senses that you could engage</v>

49
00:04:07.161 --> 00:04:12.161
<v Speaker 1>during learning the more effectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>that information was integrated into the</v>

50
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 1>person and learned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with digital media,</v>

51
00:04:16.161 --> 00:04:19.430
<v Speaker 1>we're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strongly going towards a medium</v>

52
00:04:19.431 --> 00:04:22.940
<v Speaker 1>that is visual only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

53
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>you do hear the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. But I worry that it's a passive</v>

54
00:04:27.051 --> 00:04:32.051
<v Speaker 1>stance just in terms of using the five</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses and that,</v>

55
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't learn passively.</v>

56
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I think the Best learning is done with</v>
<v Speaker 1>active manipulatIon.</v>

57
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to be able to work with our</v>

58
00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:46.430
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:51.431
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about using our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:55.940
<v Speaker 1>eventually we have to manipulate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world with our hands in order to make</v>

61
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.550
<v Speaker 1>tangible change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:04:58.551 --> 00:04:59.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.420
<v Speaker 1>students need practice with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kids need practice with that.</v>

64
00:05:02.421 --> 00:05:06.140
<v Speaker 1>We need to do that in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

65
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 1>for better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:05:07.581 --> 00:05:10.370
<v Speaker 1>our screen experiences will never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never give us that.</v>

67
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.380
<v Speaker 1>It's very important to put children in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an environment where they can take</v>

68
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>things apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.710
<v Speaker 1>where they can break things and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to fix them where they can trust</v>

70
00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:26.711
<v Speaker 1>their hands and know</v>
<v Speaker 1>their capacity to manipulate objects.</v>

71
00:05:31.641 --> 00:05:36.641
<v Speaker 1>And I see that as a much more active</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction than what the newer types of</v>

72
00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 1>technology offer as they supply</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

73
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen,</v>

75
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>et cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do worry that the hours we spend</v>

76
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.870
<v Speaker 1>that way are replacing some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are going to be important.</v>
