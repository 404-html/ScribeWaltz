<v Speaker 1>Hey Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Haitian.</v>

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm an eighth grader at Joel peanuts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle school and I was wondering why do</v>

3
00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>people have favorites if our brains</v>
<v Speaker 1>offers you really grow the same,</v>

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't we all have the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorites?</v>

5
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Aren't we all the same donor?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our brains all grow the same.</v>

6
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 2>The answer is no and yes it is to say we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have much more like a,</v>

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.890
<v Speaker 2>we are much more alike than we are</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 2>This old question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I see red,</v>

9
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:40.071
<v Speaker 2>is it the same to you as it is to me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what I think is red is really green</v>

10
00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 2>and your brain just learns to call what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a green is my red and so on.</v>

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are good questions but I think the</v>

12
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 2>reason we have favorites is that we all</v>
<v Speaker 2>are slightly different.</v>

13
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 2>We do not look identical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not biological clones.</v>

14
00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is exposed to different</v>

15
00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>experiences and different chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different things in the air and water as</v>

16
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 2>you grow up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you prefer and food,</v>

17
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could change from one place to another</v>

18
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 2>based on your environment.</v>

19
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.230
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's genes are different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The read.</v>

20
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:23.231
<v Speaker 2>One exception might be identical twins,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everybody's genes are different.</v>

21
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 2>And so what we prefer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we like,</v>

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 2>what we find is favorites is different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from one person to another,</v>

23
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 2>but if nothing else I have learned in</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

24
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 2>people are a heck of a lot more alike</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they are different.</v>

25
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 2>You'll find that if you like a yummy</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate dessert,</v>

26
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.480
<v Speaker 2>it's very likely that someone else will</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that yummy chocolate dessert that</v>

27
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:51.720
<v Speaker 2>your favorites you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may be surprised are favored by a</v>

28
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 2>great many people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get into</v>

29
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.980
<v Speaker 2>disagreements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's often I think a result of your</v>

30
00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've had great experiences eating</v>

31
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 2>ice cream with honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vanilla ice cream with honey.</v>

32
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 2>Every time I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about my dad and I have good</v>

33
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 2>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's other people who think</v>

34
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 2>vanilla ice cream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not an interesting enough to me,</v>

35
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 2>honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's too commonplace.</v>

36
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say I feel bad for you,</v>

37
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 2>but that means more vanilla and honey</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

38
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

39
00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you'll find people more alike than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are different and enjoy the favorite.</v>

40
00:02:29.011 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Celebrate these little differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of what makes life fun.</v>

41
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Carry on.</v>
