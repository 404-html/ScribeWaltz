00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.720
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother was a terrible cook,</v>

3
00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:11.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

4
00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>and my mother died when I was very young</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my father was a terrible cook,</v>

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:16.841
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

7
00:00:16.841 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>I overcompensate a little bit like for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cooking end of things.</v>

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what drove me to,</v>

9
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>to be a chef exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the kind of chef that I've become,</v>

10
00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>I think was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of unconsciously inculcated by this</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection to the land,</v>

12
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>especially to like my grandma's sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>

13
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:38.680
<v Speaker 1>which was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

14
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>it was like she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she very much believed in open space</v>

15
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in doing everything possible to</v>

16
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.060
<v Speaker 1>preserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that meant farming in the case of</v>

17
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>where Blue Hill wasn't meant to preserve</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pastoral,</v>

18
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.010
<v Speaker 1>you literally needed to pasture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>there was a responsibility came attached</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the pleasure of the views literally.</v>

21
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think somehow I have connected</v>

22
00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>that with food and the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 1>have those views and that open space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to eat it.</v>

24
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

25
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

26
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:13.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's chef and it's,</v>

27
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's being a chef and,</v>

28
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>and providing pleasure by way of a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of responsibility that's um,</v>

29
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.460
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pleasurable in and of itself.</v>

30
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>I graduated and I was a little bit lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what to do and I went out and I baked</v>

31
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:36.320
<v Speaker 1>bread in California for awhile and kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cooked on the side,</v>

32
00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>just starting some money and I thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually maybe I'd write about,</v>

33
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>I was going to write about a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

34
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>but I ended up just earning extra money</v>
<v Speaker 1>by cooking and that led one thing led to</v>

35
00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:47.370
<v Speaker 1>another and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I was always kind of undecided until I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I went to France and then I was</v>

37
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 1>really cooking and that was sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>light went off I think,</v>

38
00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>although it was an Aha moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't one of those things I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

40
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm still questioning as we sit here</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

41
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
