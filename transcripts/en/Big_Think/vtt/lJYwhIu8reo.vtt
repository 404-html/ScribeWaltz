1
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last day</v>

2
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>have put America in such jeopardy in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

3
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean the fact of these trillions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars of debt we have now,</v>

4
00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be a huge burden to</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrive with the fact that global</v>

5
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:32.500
<v Speaker 1>warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as nothing has been done about it.</v>

6
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Even Mccain now says he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think something has to be done about</v>

7
00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lord knows he changes his mind so often.</v>

8
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how long that will stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>

9
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm the Iraq war of course is a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

10
00:00:46.211 --> 00:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>And the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>

11
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.200
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the person who's job one should</v>

12
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.110
<v Speaker 1>really want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are really incredible issues.</v>

14
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>I think from what I've seen of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>his basic intelligence will allow him to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assemble a team.</v>

16
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a president is a team.</v>

17
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:15.151
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly a single person will allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to assemble people to help begin</v>

18
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that he's such an inspired</v>

19
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>arbiter or some people almost hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>against him,</v>

20
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>I think is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very crucial.</v>

21
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Very crucial at this time that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be able to speak and convince</v>

22
00:01:30.821 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>people what they have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>convince the country,</v>

23
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>convince them that there's hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all.</v>

24
00:01:38.231 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has never apparently in all the</v>

25
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>polls express so much of a lack of hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>in anything.</v>

26
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>And I think the fact that he is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiring could be very,</v>

27
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will be very assuming you went to</v>

28
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.323
<v Speaker 1>bruce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.220
<v Speaker 1>that's where Kennedy is remembered for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy made a lot of terrible mistakes.</v>

30
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 1>But what he's remembered for is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there was a moment when people felt</v>

31
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>as though there were light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's partly,</v>

32
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a good part of what a leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>

33
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>A leader finds the positive things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finds what we can do.</v>

34
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason Bush's administration was so</v>

35
00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:34.501
<v Speaker 1>despairing to so many of us was that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was based in fear.</v>

36
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a constant repetition of fear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be afraid of this.</v>

37
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:41.950
<v Speaker 1>So we have to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to be afraid of that.</v>

38
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>So we can do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

39
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.150
<v Speaker 1>and this is what's happened is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people now are really in a state of</v>

40
00:02:49.151 --> 00:02:52.390
<v Speaker 1>anguish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to be that way.</v>
