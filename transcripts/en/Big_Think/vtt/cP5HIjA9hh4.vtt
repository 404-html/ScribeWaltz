1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And some of you may be wondering whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually in a relationship with a</v>

2
00:00:05.191 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>psychopath or whether the youth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've fallen for a psychopath in</v>

3
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are in a relationship with a</v>

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a what you can do about that.</v>

5
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>psychopaths do have certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>

7
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Certain tells a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use a poker analogy,</v>

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>a that they display in relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>they tend to play on our pity a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 1>So they tend to excuse they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdemeanors and bad behaviors,</v>

11
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through something that would be on their</v>

12
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:38.490
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't help doing it because you</v>

13
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something had happened and you know,</v>

14
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>there's always an excuse for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all those psychopaths don't feel</v>

15
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>emotions like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are masters at pushing those</v>

16
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>emotional hot buttons that elicit</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotions in,</v>

17
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in others,</v>

18
00:00:52.861 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>in us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>sympathy being one of the major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major motivators.</v>

20
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A psychopath also tend to be very</v>

21
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.310
<v Speaker 1>narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>they tend to think that the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>centers around them.</v>

23
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>They're not really attuned to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

24
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>They don't really care about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>feelings.</v>

25
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.271
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

26
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>surrounds a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounds them a solid psychopathic,</v>

28
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>also very charming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very manipulative,</v>

29
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're in a crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're in company.</v>

30
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but behind the scenes when they're alone</v>

31
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can be very,</v>

32
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>very controlling sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not always aggressive,</v>

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>but psychologically controlling as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you're worried about the fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're worried that your,</v>

35
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:37.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a relationship with a psychopath,</v>

37
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>what can you do about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What might be some certain things to,</v>

38
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>to look out for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the absolute first thing to do is,</v>

40
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not go on face value,</v>

41
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>to not fall for the smokescreen.</v>

42
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:01:55.021 --> 00:02:00.021
<v Speaker 1>number one rule of thumb is to don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge a person on what they say,</v>

44
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>but judge a person on what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

45
00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>So that's the very first thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the evidence of their behavior</v>

46
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>and try to judge it objectively rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than subjectively.</v>

47
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Not An easy thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I admit.</v>

48
00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone.</v>

49
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you suspect that your partner is a</v>

50
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:22.050
<v Speaker 1>psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you get a second opinion from</v>

51
00:02:22.051 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>one of your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you confide in your friends?</v>

52
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I think my partner is a psychopath or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think these,</v>

53
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>are there certain characteristics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me an honest opinion.</v>

54
00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>What do you really think about my</v>
<v Speaker 1>partner?</v>

55
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a second opinion.</v>

56
00:02:35.041 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Two heads are often better than one in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of case.</v>

57
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Thirdly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numb.</v>

58
00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:44.391
<v Speaker 1>A golden rule is don't cover for them if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start getting into serious trouble</v>

59
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>and they want you to somehow front up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them or be an alibi or somehow make</v>

60
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.300
<v Speaker 1>excuses or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

61
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Don't get tangled up into covering up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them because as soon as that starts</v>

62
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the foot in the door</v>

63
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>

64
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>very common persuasive technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you've done something for someone,</v>

65
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to do other followup</v>
<v Speaker 1>things for them.</v>

66
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>And before you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your in,</v>

67
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>up to your neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

68
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth thing I would say is buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book,</v>

69
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because all the,</v>

70
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the signs and all the tricks of the</v>

71
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>trainer in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

72
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>and fore warned is definitely forearm</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with sign up.</v>
