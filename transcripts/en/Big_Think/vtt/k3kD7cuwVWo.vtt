<v Speaker 1>So I want to keep it in Italian,</v>

21
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>in spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 1>uptown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was the chef at cafe blue,</v>

23
00:01:10.721 --> 00:01:11.554
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I had some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmother's parole,</v>

25
00:01:13.451 --> 00:01:17.740
<v Speaker 1>he's on the menu</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were pretty good.</v>

26
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

27
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got some,</v>

28
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got some mentions.</v>

29
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really promote them or</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

30
00:01:22.861 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>They just put them on the menu just</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to make some,</v>

31
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:27.490
<v Speaker 1>and they were a little bit fancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.540
<v Speaker 1>it was like three different flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I made a sauce with the juice from</v>

33
00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>the Sauerkraut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homemade Sauerkraut,</v>

34
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and it had like poppy seeds and Julian</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple and stuff like that on it.</v>

35
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.420
<v Speaker 1>So it was kind of like a fancy version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the progress that we used to buy when</v>

36
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid at the parochial church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was down the street.</v>

37
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.640

38
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a similar thing,</v>

39
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>but the routines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the eye,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that immigrated from Paris to freely in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mid 18 hundreds.</v>

42
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my grandmother was half French and,</v>

45
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.300
