1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did I haven't read any papers for</v>

3
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:12.314
<v Speaker 2>at least a month.</v>

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.933
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's at once.</v>

6
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 2>Two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the dumbest moves I've ever heard</v>

7
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:28.491
<v Speaker 2>of being made by a network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also it's what I knew what I first</v>

8
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>heard about it when back when they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling Jay,</v>

9
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>although your ratings are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't need you to forever so you</v>

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wonderful way to treat the psyche of</v>

11
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 2>the performer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is one thing that we're people</v>

12
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 2>never have a clue about.</v>

13
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.523
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

14
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 2>and I knew when I first heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is never going to work.</v>

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't pretend to know who I.</v>

16
00:00:55.721 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 2>10:00 proved to be such an awful time</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a talk show,</v>

17
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 2>but it is the psychology of that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>later when the show's on and people have</v>

18
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 2>had a drink or two and are about to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>to bed and want some entertainment</v>

19
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:15.841
<v Speaker 2>before nodding off is very different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from how you feel at 10:00 when you</v>

20
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 2>could see law and order another such</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows and,</v>

21
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>and it just a natural institute over to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mess Jay inherited.</v>

22
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 2>And that Conan was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wa interestingly pointed out that,</v>

23
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hijack offer,</v>

25
00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:43.461
<v Speaker 2>they offered him that cynical thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one in his right mind would accept to</v>

26
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:45.114
<v Speaker 2>get rid of him.</v>

27
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.473
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

28
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 2>when you said that you can have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tonight show at 12.</v>

29
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:50.774
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>five.</v>

30
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody including code and pointed out</v>

31
00:01:53.271 --> 00:01:53.751
<v Speaker 2>that 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

32
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 2>five is no longer tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tomorrow.</v>

33
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.000
<v Speaker 2>So it would have to be called the early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>early show,</v>

34
00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 2>but anything but the tonight show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any managed,</v>

35
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:07.291
<v Speaker 2>I think to damage to make somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>damaged goods of both artists involved.</v>

36
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 2>And they also succeeded in making their</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy,</v>

37
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:17.711
<v Speaker 2>David Letterman and vcs competition more</v>
<v Speaker 2>successful in evart.</v>

38
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 2>So whoever is responsible for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>boneheaded move,</v>

39
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we know from watching these things,</v>

40
00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 2>certainly within a week or to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted and given a big raise.</v>
