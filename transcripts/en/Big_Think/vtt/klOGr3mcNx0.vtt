1
00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people who are for</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and a lot of people are against</v>

2
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that most of the people who</v>

3
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four of them are essentially ip holding</v>

4
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>companies who just sit around and wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>with patents and wait until technology</v>

5
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>actually gets interesting using</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that could potentially be</v>

6
00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>covered by these patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they sue people and they don't</v>

7
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>generally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't sue smaller companies.</v>

8
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>They sue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft and IBM and of course IBM and,</v>

9
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all these big companies have their</v>

10
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>own patents pools and they use them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage against other companies with</v>

11
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:35.340
<v Speaker 1>patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>but I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I think there are so many problems with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

14
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problems are that you have</v>

15
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>people patenting and things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially math,</v>

16
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>which is what patents are not supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be even about at all.</v>

17
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

18
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other problems.</v>

19
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>There are no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

20
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually drunk when I give this</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation and it comes out so much</v>

21
00:01:04.621 --> 00:01:05.454
<v Speaker 1>smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think that there are a big</v>

23
00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker 1>largely because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you can infringe on them without knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you do and as a smaller company you</v>

26
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

27
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't have resources to go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>research whether or not you do it.</v>

28
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could write a 100,000 lines of code</v>

29
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>and for all I know 50,000 women fringe</v>
<v Speaker 1>on various things.</v>

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wouldn't know that.</v>

31
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>And normally if you infringe someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trademark,</v>

32
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>if they don't enforce it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>it's to your advantage because a phase</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start to lose their rights.</v>

35
00:01:42.211 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>Whereas patents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't enforce it for 10 years,</v>

36
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>they can come and sue you for the 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that you've been making money on</v>

37
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>their patent and you're completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>screwed.</v>

38
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>So there's no incentive for them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually go and,</v>

39
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.483
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>try to legitimately licensed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the kind of thing where</v>

41
00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>there are probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably some middle ground</v>

42
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it makes sense to have things be</v>
<v Speaker 1>patentable.</v>

44
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously in many places it does make</v>

45
00:02:08.581 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things like software and people</v>

46
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>patenting DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

47
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.913
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>it's at the point where you have things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are so abstract that they really</v>

49
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:23.061
<v Speaker 1>should belong to everybody and no one's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like making viable businesses on</v>

50
00:02:23.311 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>software patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing they're doing is</v>

51
00:02:24.991 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>extorting money out of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.680
<v Speaker 1>and the people who have the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>software patents probably don't even</v>

53
00:02:31.681 --> 00:02:34.980
<v Speaker 1>want them to exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just forced to do it to cover</v>

54
00:02:34.981 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>their own asses.</v>
