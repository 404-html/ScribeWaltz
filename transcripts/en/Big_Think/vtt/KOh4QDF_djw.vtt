00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.033
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 2>democracy can mean a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

3
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 2>but at mit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bomb to be a democracy,</v>

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 2>we have to have a system that involves</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the judgment of the people</v>

5
00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 2>and the regular judgment worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has to be a judgment where people</v>

6
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 2>after console one another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think have a democracy to call them in</v>

7
00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.381
<v Speaker 2>democracy where people don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect across their differences for the</v>

8
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 2>co equal people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other side of issues,</v>

9
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it may be,</v>

10
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>and I think that whatever form you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>voting is whether you have direct</v>

11
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you're have indirect</v>

12
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>representation with a proportional</v>
<v Speaker 2>representation,</v>

13
00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 2>what he would like by districts where</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would like by winner take all,</v>

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever it may be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever your voting system is.</v>

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 2>Democracy has mainly worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precedes the voting democracy,</v>

16
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 2>is that deliberation amongst citizens</v>
<v Speaker 2>and involve citizens.</v>

17
00:01:01.431 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 2>Beliefs that what we have to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters and should matter to each other</v>

18
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 2>and our ability and our comfort level</v>
<v Speaker 2>with sitting and talking and also</v>

19
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.990
<v Speaker 2>listening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to persuade others,</v>

20
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 2>but first log in to try to persuade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

21
00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.090
<v Speaker 2>Really allowed the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really listen to what they have to say</v>

22
00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 2>is they have dismissing it out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That to me is democracy.</v>

23
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's rough and tumble.</v>

24
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't always get quick and</v>
<v Speaker 2>efficient answers,</v>

25
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 2>but it is the only thing I think I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been really do in which people actually</v>

26
00:01:30.831 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>participate in governing themselves.</v>
