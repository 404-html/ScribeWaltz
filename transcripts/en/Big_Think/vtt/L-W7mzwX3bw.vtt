1
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>Especially with a platform technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can go after many different</v>

2
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>product applications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you ultimately get valued most</v>

3
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:20.850
<v Speaker 1>importantly on the first application you</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring forward and as an entrepreneur you</v>

4
00:00:20.851 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>have limited time and limited resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you need to choose well and drive</v>

5
00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>deep into clinical and regulatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>validation for that first product.</v>

6
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>Now in order to make that often really</v>
<v Speaker 1>painful decision about what to invest in</v>

7
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>and what to leave on the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least for awhile,</v>

8
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>there's many aspects of a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>product you need to think through.</v>

9
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Obviously market size plays a role,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a technical fit to need plays a role.</v>

10
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.100
<v Speaker 1>As I'm looking at new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often try to follow some of the advice</v>

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I once got from Bob Langer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has been very prolific.</v>

12
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.780
<v Speaker 1>He's started roughly 50 companies out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lab,</v>

13
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I think at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've had the honor of starting two</v>

14
00:00:58.171 --> 00:00:59.004
<v Speaker 1>companies with them.</v>

15
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the other kind of rules of the</v>

16
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He shares his first look for a platform</v>

17
00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to build a company,</v>

18
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>make sure that if you're successful in</v>
<v Speaker 1>one area,</v>

19
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>it can create value in a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjacent areas because that really</v>

20
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>justifies bringing in the investment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>building the whole infrastructure,</v>

21
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>not just for one product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but potentially for many,</v>

22
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>but within that it's crucially important</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps most important to select an</v>

23
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that has a very clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined first product opportunity that</v>

24
00:01:30.151 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you have the ability to drive to a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>value creation,</v>

25
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>a event like a regulatory or clinical</v>
<v Speaker 1>approval.</v>

26
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>As you're building a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ultimately get valued on that lead</v>

27
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 1>asset you're carrying forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's important to have a platform but</v>

28
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>not to lose focus within that platform</v>
<v Speaker 1>and make one crucial bet that ultimately</v>

29
00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>can drive the early success of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

30
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>What really gets me excited is</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing new therapies that can help</v>

31
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to do that,</v>

32
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>you need to think through who exactly is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patient you're trying to help,</v>

33
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.830
<v Speaker 1>what disease do they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what kind of clinical trial could</v>

34
00:02:01.831 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you design that really proves that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're giving a benefit to that patient.</v>

35
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>When you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to think through what type of</v>

36
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>therapy is practical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it given,</v>

37
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>how frequently and by whom and in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand that whole pathway from</v>

38
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:20.961
<v Speaker 1>basic discovery to delivering an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic requires a great variety of</v>

39
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>different skills you must bring together</v>
<v Speaker 1>and early in our startups,</v>

40
00:02:26.251 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>what we've done is first focused on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fundamental biology,</v>

41
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>but then defined who are the experts</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way that we're going to need</v>

42
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>to engage in order to advance all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way through the development regulatory</v>

43
00:02:37.321 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>and clinical process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can encourage young innovators</v>

44
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 1>enough to think about engaging product</v>
<v Speaker 1>development experts and clinical experts</v>

45
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>early in the discovery process because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really shapes what you're trying to</v>

46
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 1>discover and what you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create.</v>

47
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.690
<v Speaker 1>That can ultimately help the patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I interact with a lot of young</v>

48
00:02:54.691 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs who are thinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting companies,</v>

49
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the most important piece of advice I</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to give them,</v>

50
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>particularly on the technical side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is find someone who has totally</v>

51
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>different skills from you that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust and will challenge you.</v>

52
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>It can help you think through the many</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>

53
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>It takes to address to build a business</v>
<v Speaker 1>or create a new therapy.</v>

54
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was when Bob Langer introduced me</v>

55
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>to David Lucchino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who in 2005,</v>

56
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became my co founder of my first startup</v>

57
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and he took me out of the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dragged me into the hospital and really</v>

58
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>started meeting nurses and purchasers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doctors who were people I'd never</v>

59
00:03:31.091 --> 00:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>really interacted with at a deep level</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could start to understand if were</v>

60
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>to develop a new product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are all the stakeholders this</v>

61
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>product would need to satisfy and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I understand all of their</v>

62
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of their constraints.</v>

63
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Because ultimately to get a new product</v>
<v Speaker 1>to patients,</v>

64
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you need to understand the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery system.</v>

65
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>It's must go through in order to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>that forward and who must become</v>

66
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 1>champions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way that was going to</v>

67
00:03:55.721 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>happen is by that early interaction in</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction to David who brought a</v>

68
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:03.220
<v Speaker 1>business and marketing and totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>different background.</v>

69
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>But we challenge each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have mutual respect and it's let us</v>

70
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>build now to businesses that have have</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought a number of exciting things into</v>

71
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.180
<v Speaker 1>the clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to enter this industry,</v>

72
00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly as an entrepreneur,</v>

73
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>as a first timer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was straight out of Grad</v>

74
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into my first startup and really</v>

75
00:04:19.841 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>had no experience developing products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The advice I'd give is really to engage</v>

76
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>people who've gone through that product</v>
<v Speaker 1>development experience very early on.</v>

77
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>They'll have a lot of rules of the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of mistakes to avoid a and can</v>

78
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>really help make you successful even if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the deep domain</v>

79
00:04:38.381 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>experience yet.</v>

80
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing how much young</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs who have a passion and</v>

81
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and some really big ideas can</v>
<v Speaker 1>engage in drawing people who have deep</v>

82
00:04:47.951 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>experience even before potentially they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could afford them as consultants or</v>

83
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think as entrepreneurs we're dreaming</v>

84
00:04:55.271 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can share that energy,</v>

85
00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>share that vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people involved,</v>

86
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>and really bring in a fantastic folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the very early stage.</v>

87
00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.230
<v Speaker 1>One lesson that was imparted to me early</v>
<v Speaker 1>in in my previous startup was to think</v>

88
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.620
<v Speaker 1>very critically about all the testing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the features that a medical</v>

89
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>device must go through to be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were essentially creating a new</v>

90
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>technology to try to make medical</v>
<v Speaker 1>devices safer,</v>

91
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.580
<v Speaker 1>reducing clots or infection was</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately our goal for devices that</v>

92
00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>went into the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we thought initially as</v>

93
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>technologists about the new feature we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are creating and how powerful it was and</v>

94
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>how helpful it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we started to work with</v>

95
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>experienced product developers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they made us realize that these devices</v>

96
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 1>were designed with a certain application</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mind.</v>

97
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.610
<v Speaker 1>They needed to perform certain functions</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and foremost,</v>

98
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and as we're adding our new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're making our advance,</v>

99
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.920
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't do any harm to the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard of care as we're adding new</v>

100
00:05:53.921 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew an existing product and that even</v>

101
00:05:56.201 --> 00:06:01.201
<v Speaker 1>applies in thinking about not in any way</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling short of the standard of care in</v>

102
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>some aspects as you're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve.</v>

103
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Another aspect is very important and</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience product developers can really</v>

104
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>help you understand that process in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to drive new innovative medicines</v>

105
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>to the clinic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

106
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>a critical aspect of this is developing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strong intellectual property position</v>

107
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>because of the great resources required</v>
<v Speaker 1>to advance the medicine.</v>

108
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.230
<v Speaker 1>It can be hundreds of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars to advance from concept through</v>

109
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>trials and even billions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>before ultimate launch of a product.</v>

110
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>In order to justify those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

111
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.310
<v Speaker 1>one needs to be able to have a product</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one can protect for a period of</v>

112
00:06:34.311 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>time on the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The benefits of the patent system are</v>

113
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>essentially it's a trade for a period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

114
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 1>You're granted that right?</v>
