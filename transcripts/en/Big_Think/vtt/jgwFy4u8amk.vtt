1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>The robots have the cartoons and movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 19 seventies are going to be</v>

2
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:14.300
<v Speaker 1>the reality of the 20 slash 20 and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are two real drivers behind this.</v>

3
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>First is mapping belief space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Historically it's been really difficult</v>

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>to be able to instruct robots to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like grasping,</v>

5
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>grasping might seem like a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>straightforward thing to do,</v>

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically and algorithmically to be</v>

7
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>able to instruct robots how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what this mathematical</v>

8
00:00:37.611 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough in mapping belief space has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done is it as taken what are</v>

9
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:47.591
<v Speaker 1>historically very complex tasks for</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots and made them easier to do.</v>

10
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is cloud robotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if c three Po right now,</v>

11
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:57.980
<v Speaker 1>if he walked over here and interrupted</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big think interview,</v>

12
00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my,</v>

13
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:01:00.501 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get out of the frame.</v>

15
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>And as he did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there would be a lot of hardware and</v>

16
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>software worrying in that gold claiming</v>
<v Speaker 1>body of his.</v>

17
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>In reality the c three Po of the 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>slash 20 will be a cloud connected</v>

18
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what he would do if he stumbled</v>

19
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>into this interview is he is he would</v>
<v Speaker 1>ping the cloud and he would get</v>

20
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:28.001
<v Speaker 1>instructions from the hive mind that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>their algorithmically and he would then</v>

21
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 1>know to excuse himself to do so in</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and two though,</v>

22
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>then go clunk away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does this mean?</v>

23
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>What this means is that the robots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our youths and of our imaginations don't</v>

24
00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>have to have millions of dollars of</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly sophisticated hardware and</v>

25
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 1>software in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can be relatively lightweight dumb</v>

26
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>devices so long as they're connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of the cloud.</v>

27
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>So what's the significance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>So they're cheaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the big significance here really</v>

29
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:03.110
<v Speaker 1>goes to labor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's think about the difference</v>

30
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>between humans and robots and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>

31
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>Humans don't have a lot of cap ex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a lot of opex.</v>

32
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>So the upfront costs costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:02:12.711 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>maybe your employer buys you some</v>
<v Speaker 1>business cards,</v>

34
00:02:14.961 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>maybe gets you a computer for work or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

35
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of cap ex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lot of upfront costs,</v>

36
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.890
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of opex every two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to get paid,</v>

37
00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:26.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lot of salary,</v>

38
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>lot of op ex robots come with</v>
<v Speaker 1>diametrically opposed cost structure.</v>

39
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of cap ex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to buy the robot,</v>

40
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 1>but then relatively little objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can work them 24 hours a day.</v>

41
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>They aren't going to join a union or get</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick and they don't expect to salary and</v>

42
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:49.661
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening right now is we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing new equilibrium points in terms</v>

43
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:55.570
<v Speaker 1>of the tradeoff between the relative</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost of a cap backs,</v>

44
00:02:55.611 --> 00:03:00.611
<v Speaker 1>intense opex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slight robot and a cap ex light opics in</v>

45
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>high labor of humans.</v>

46
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>I saw this in all places in East Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the football field,</v>

47
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>size factories of Fox con,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Taiwanese company that makes all of</v>

48
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:18.631
<v Speaker 1>our smartphones and Terry Gou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of Foxconn who employs 973,000</v>

49
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:24.020
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has decided he's not hiring anymore</v>

50
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just buying robots.</v>

51
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that this is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is fascinating stuff.</v>

52
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 1>As the robots have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cartoons and movies become the</v>

53
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>reality of the 20 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't going to look like the</v>

54
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:42.580
<v Speaker 1>metallic out the metallic robots have of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cartoons and movies that are</v>

55
00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>actually going to look more human</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of advances in material sciences</v>

56
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>from electroactive polymers to to silk</v>
<v Speaker 1>skin to air muscles and other such</v>

57
00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the robots are the future may</v>

58
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 1>actually look more like terminator than</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Star Wars.</v>

59
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 1>What's also interesting that's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now is,</v>

60
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>particularly in Japan and South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are robots being developed.</v>

61
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of which is actually to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we normally think of as the most</v>

62
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>intimate human tasks to do things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of our aging grandparents and</v>

63
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>part of this is flowing from an economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperative and Japan,</v>

64
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan has the world's oldest population</v>

65
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and it's only growing older and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies like Toyota and Honda.</v>

66
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that make the cars are now</v>

67
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:44.161
<v Speaker 1>making elder care robots because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't enough young Japanese to take</v>

68
00:04:44.741 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>care of the grandparents and so things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we think of as very intimate and</v>

69
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 1>very human in the future will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly robotic.</v>

70
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not a surprise that this is coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Asia.</v>

71
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in societies like Japan,</v>

72
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>where Shinto is the Nash is the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

73
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>In Shinto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

74
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>they have a belief in animism that</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects can have souls,</v>

75
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.210
<v Speaker 1>and so that's a big difference than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judeo Christian religions,</v>

76
00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.240
<v Speaker 1>which think of objects as being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>soulless and if you contrast the culture</v>

77
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and mythology of a lot of Asian</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>

78
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 1>it's much more embracing of automation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and robotics as opposed to western</v>

79
00:05:29.621 --> 00:05:34.621
<v Speaker 1>societies were from icarus with his wax</v>
<v Speaker 1>wings to Frankenstein and beyond.</v>

80
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Most of our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of our mythology is rooted in the</v>

81
00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>risks of giving life to those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps we ought not to.</v>

82
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it's a big surprise</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of these innovations are</v>

83
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>coming from East Asia.</v>
