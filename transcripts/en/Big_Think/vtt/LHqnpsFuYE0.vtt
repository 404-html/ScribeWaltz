00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.170
<v Speaker 1>What was the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean did in the 19 sixties,</v>

2
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a sense of,</v>

3
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.600
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really a questioning of how had</v>

4
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this commitment to democratic</v>

5
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>values justified,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>a series of prejudices and tolerances</v>
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>

7
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatments of,</v>

8
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>of women as less than fully human women</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have a bank account.</v>

9
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Women couldn't have a credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>you don't remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember teaching at Harvard,</v>

11
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 1>there were no women on the faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>and that all changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That changed relationships between men</v>

13
00:00:57.391 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the issue I was talking about</v>

14
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was for a woman to feel that what</v>

15
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>I know or what I believe or what I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what I feel or what I want is</v>

16
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not the only thing,</v>

17
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 1>but it has legitimacy of its own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was huge rather than seeing it as</v>

18
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:20.214
<v Speaker 1>selfish.</v>

19
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Now that of course if you've been at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce want or desire,</v>

20
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>you introduce sexuality and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the old sort of framework,</v>

21
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>women were seen as not wanting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sex is not sexual beings.</v>

22
00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not having desires and thoughts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own quota.</v>

23
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Funny Authority on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Freud who said that the so</v>

24
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.761
<v Speaker 1>called intellectual inferiority of women</v>
<v Speaker 1>was due to their needing to suppress</v>

25
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>their sexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you couldn't think about all</v>

26
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>aspects of yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to start restricting how that</v>

27
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>you could think at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also I would say having to distance</v>

28
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>yourself from your body because your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body was seen as somehow bad or wrong.</v>

29
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>You lost touch with your experience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was very easy for women to not</v>

30
00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:14.331
<v Speaker 1>know what they knew through experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be open to all kinds of.</v>
