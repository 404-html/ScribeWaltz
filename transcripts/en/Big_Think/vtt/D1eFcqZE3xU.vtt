1
00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.390
<v Speaker 1>So for 300 years in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was really no such thing as fair</v>

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.010
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that there was no way to</v>

3
00:00:08.011 --> 00:00:13.011
<v Speaker 1>recognize from a consumer's purchases</v>
<v Speaker 1>that workers were treated well in the</v>

4
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.431
<v Speaker 1>thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>

5
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>and fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A movement started in California,</v>

6
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>lead eventually by Dolores Huerta and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cesar Chavez that morphed into the</v>

7
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>United Farm Workers Union and people of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain age,</v>

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>my age and above,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 1>can remember not eating grapes or</v>
<v Speaker 1>lettuce in the seventies because of the</v>

10
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:38.520
<v Speaker 1>nationwide boycotts against produce that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't picked fairly,</v>

11
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't picked in those days by</v>
<v Speaker 1>union members.</v>

12
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unions have been decimated all across</v>

13
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>the countries and the eighties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

14
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:50.421
<v Speaker 1>Most of the union protections that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>won by farm workers were rolled back.</v>

15
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Farmworkers have two things against</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many states,</v>

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>most workers can't unionize without the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of losing their job.</v>

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>In Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

19
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a right to work state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means euphemistically,</v>

20
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>that if you decide to unionize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your employer can fire you just for</v>

21
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

22
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>In California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

23
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>they can't fire you because you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to organize a union.</v>

24
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the National Labor</v>

25
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Standards Act that was set in 1938 by</v>
<v Speaker 1>FDR that set the minimum wage</v>

26
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>requirements for workers all across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

27
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>farm workers were the exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farm workers and domestic workers were</v>

28
00:01:32.611 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>predominantly African American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order for Fdr to pass that bill,</v>

29
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>he needed the support of the southern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats who refuse to let their</v>

30
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>African Americans have the same rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>that workers all across the nation we're</v>

31
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so farm workers and domestic workers</v>

32
00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>were excluded from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So fast forward to the present,</v>

33
00:01:51.991 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>day and age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no unions.</v>

34
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>Farm workers aren't really protected by</v>
<v Speaker 1>national labor laws.</v>

35
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>They definitely aren't entitled to</v>
<v Speaker 1>overtime.</v>

36
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that for consumer</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's asking themselves,</v>

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
<v Speaker 1>is my food fair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer 99 point nine,</v>

38
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

39
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of the time is either no or</v>

40
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>there's no way to tell.</v>

41
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.240
<v Speaker 1>My film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Food chains focuses on one small group</v>

42
00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>of workers from central Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Southern Florida really called the</v>

43
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>coalition of immokalee workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amockley isn't a native American word,</v>

44
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>which means our home and it's a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny labor camp in southern Florida</v>

45
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Speaker 1>right next to Naples and I call it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor camp because it's got a um,</v>

46
00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>wintertime population of 40,000 people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the harvest is in full swing,</v>

47
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>but there is no city council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no mayor,</v>

48
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
<v Speaker 1>there's no real infrastructure in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>city and it's only 15 miles away from</v>

49
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>the richest zip code in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naples.</v>

50
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>So in Macula is a labor camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that little labor camp,</v>

51
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>some of the worst atrocities in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country have happened from modern day</v>

52
00:03:04.121 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>slavery to sexual harassment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really her really horrific crimes in</v>

53
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a little group called the ciw.</v>

54
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>The coalition of immokalee workers</v>
<v Speaker 1>created a program called the fair food</v>

55
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.294
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

56
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.390
<v Speaker 1>And that fair food program is really the</v>
<v Speaker 1>only program in the United States that</v>

57
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:27.481
<v Speaker 1>absolutely guarantees that workers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field earn more than sub poverty</v>

58
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>level wages and are entitled to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>complete spectrum of human rights</v>

59
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>guarantees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've gotten 12 major retailers to</v>

60
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>sign onto that program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means in simple terms is</v>

61
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>that if you go to Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole foods,</v>

62
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 1>trader Joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you eat it almost any fast food</v>

63
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>restaurant in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except one ds in the wintertime,</v>

64
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>most likely your tomato is from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

65
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a fair food tomato.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you want to eat fair,</v>

66
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 1>you can go to whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to Walmart.</v>

67
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to trader Joe's and buy their</v>

68
00:04:02.111 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Florida tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only product in the entire</v>

69
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:10.261
<v Speaker 1>United States that's absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed out a doubt to be fair labor.</v>
