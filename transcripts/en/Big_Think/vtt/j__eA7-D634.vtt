00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was so young when I was in New York,</v>

2
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I certainly wrote a lot,</v>

3
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 2>but last time I was here I found it</v>
<v Speaker 2>really distracting.</v>

4
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 2>I was hard to stay indoors because I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be out all the time.</v>

5
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important thing is to</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>just get a ritual down wherever you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Process.</v>

7
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 2>Well there's two parts to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the long term process of a novel</v>

8
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 2>and then there's the daily stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

9
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:47.980
<v Speaker 2>it's like planning for a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

10
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you set up your training schedule,</v>

11
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have your idea.</v>

12
00:00:51.941 --> 00:00:53.050
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I plotted out,</v>

13
00:00:53.051 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 2>I have to make a huge outline of it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

14
00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>And then I work every day about nine to</v>
<v Speaker 2>two or three.</v>

15
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:05.491
<v Speaker 2>I have to get three pages down everyday</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's usually a point about 150</v>

16
00:01:05.981 --> 00:01:08.890
<v Speaker 2>pages in where everything falls apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

17
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 2>all the plans are for not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book has become something else and I</v>

18
00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:18.571
<v Speaker 2>have a nervous breakdown and then I</v>
<v Speaker 2>submit to what the book has become and I</v>

19
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:20.644
<v Speaker 2>keep going</v>

20
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's a terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then a great time.</v>

21
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>No one likes to be around me during that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell people.</v>

22
00:01:34.121 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think it's just</v>

23
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 2>what everyone says.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

24
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 2>it's willpower kind of a game that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's.</v>

25
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Because the weirdest part in graduate</v>
<v Speaker 2>school was that the most talented</v>

26
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 2>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not the ones who became writers.</v>

27
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 2>It was the dog had once and that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's actually talent too I guess is</v>

28
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:56.271
<v Speaker 2>just being willing to go every day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay there until the pages appear every</v>

29
00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 2>day and not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell this to my students too.</v>

30
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you can write a short story</v>

31
00:02:01.531 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 2>overnight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the job.</v>

32
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 2>That's not a longterm skill.</v>

33
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>You need to write a short story over a</v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

34
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>every month and I think that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's the right decision</v>

35
00:02:18.131 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

36
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was coming from New York,</v>

37
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.930
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't afford anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was having a hard time figuring out</v>

38
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 2>how to be a writer here and I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

39
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Montana was a very attractive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different plan and it worked</v>

40
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 2>out great for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

41
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure it helped my writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

42
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 2>because you have a committee of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are also lung young like you and</v>

43
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>don't really know how to do it well</v>
<v Speaker 2>either,</v>

44
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 2>so it's a funny committee to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>submitting your work too and you have to</v>

45
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 2>really know the confident in what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing because I wasn't writing like</v>

46
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>anyone else there and that was hard for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me to figure out and I think it would</v>

47
00:02:57.421 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's destructive to a novel for sure</v>

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.630
<v Speaker 2>because you meet every week with part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>a novel that really what you should</v>

49
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.110
<v Speaker 1>tell you a novelist is keep going until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you finished the draft.</v>

50
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>Don't trust anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Montana.</v>

51
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

52
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.190
<v Speaker 1>it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

53
00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 2>then also it was pretty cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark winters.</v>

54
00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 2>I guess that helps novel writing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>historically,</v>

55
00:03:25.281 --> 00:03:28.430
<v Speaker 2>but it also helps drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.950
<v Speaker 2>at those times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But maybe that helps a novel too.</v>

57
00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.660
<v Speaker 2>But I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

58
00:03:32.661 --> 00:03:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I go every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

59
00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 2>I stay for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love going to writers colonies and</v>

60
00:03:37.881 --> 00:03:39.890
<v Speaker 2>pastoral settings where there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>

61
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.293
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

62
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.960
<v Speaker 1>either walk around or read a book or</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on your book and they all seem</v>

63
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>helpful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in felonies.</v>

64
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going there and then a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You work all day and produce so much</v>

66
00:04:00.921 --> 00:04:05.921
<v Speaker 2>work and it doesn't feel like work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just feels like it feels like when</v>

67
00:04:06.021 --> 00:04:09.620
<v Speaker 2>you start out writing and you just want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to write all the time and you're just so</v>

68
00:04:09.621 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 2>excited about everything you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like that.</v>

69
00:04:11.451 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to recreate because a lot of</v>

70
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>time it feels like a job.</v>

71
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.310
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're building something</v>
<v Speaker 3>really huge.</v>
