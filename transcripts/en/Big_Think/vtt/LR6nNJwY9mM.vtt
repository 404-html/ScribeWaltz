00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violin is,</v>

2
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of my voices.</v>

3
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the voices that express my</v>

4
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my feelings,</v>

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.140
<v Speaker 1>my understandings of different things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>different matters.</v>

6
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tries to communicate</v>

7
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>different messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ideas.</v>

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different discoveries,</v>

9
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different beliefs,</v>

10
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different interpretations.</v>

11
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different things.</v>

12
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence is really for me to voice.</v>

13
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.850
<v Speaker 1>My violin was made in 1734.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made by granaries still jaisal.</v>

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm most notable acres for the</v>

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 1>instrument of the violin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and I've had it for a little over 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>years now.</v>

17
00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Italian,</v>

18
00:01:02.641 --> 00:01:07.641
<v Speaker 1>it's made like a starter as violent or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other ordinary as violence meeting</v>

19
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.520
<v Speaker 1>Cremona in Italy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to say,</v>

20
00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:20.091
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the violin and what's me because</v>

21
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the combination that really makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>it very unique.</v>

22
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another player playing the exact same</v>

23
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>violin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>would sound very differently.</v>

25
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might play another instrument.</v>

26
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the one that I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but might be something else and I would</v>

27
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>still sound like me also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really a combination.</v>

28
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that the violent is a living</v>

29
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's extremely sensitive to humidity and</v>

31
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>to heat temperature changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very capricious.</v>

33
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm temperamental.</v>

34
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

35
00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>it gets grouchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

36
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm meant to a good mood.</v>

37
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Takes regular maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like going to violin doctor.</v>

38
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I actually love this instrument and</v>

39
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.720
<v Speaker 1>it just feels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just feels like this is the partner</v>

40
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.570
<v Speaker 1>that I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>and I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very grateful for having access to such</v>

42
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>a great instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

43
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter food place on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a great instrument,</v>

44
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's something about this particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>great instrument that I'm just so I'm</v>

45
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>attracted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a lot to do with</v>

46
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 1>chemistry as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you know,</v>

47
00:02:42.511 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.150
<v Speaker 1>one can say as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put this element into this</v>

49
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then this person's going to like it</v>

50
00:02:50.971 --> 00:02:55.971
<v Speaker 1>better is I think just a combination of</v>
<v Speaker 1>known and unknown things that make it</v>

51
00:02:56.881 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very special.</v>

52
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I consider it a partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of it as an extension of</v>

53
00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>myself and people like to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>a violin could be like a part of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body or a part of you.</v>

56
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.380
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a wonderful partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I do give it that little distance that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that lives with that</v>

58
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>objective.</v>
