1
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most memorable</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments was when I first saw her,</v>

2
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>cause uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:13.991 --> 00:00:18.991
<v Speaker 1>I had seen many pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many videos of earth from space and</v>

4
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>being able to see that with my own eyes</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a completely different effect and</v>

5
00:00:23.921 --> 00:00:28.921
<v Speaker 1>sort of almost sensing life emanating</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our planet in the dark background</v>

6
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>of the space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a really memorable experience.</v>

7
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't frightened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been living this in my head for</v>

8
00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:42.850
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>

9
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of had played all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenarios,</v>

11
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:51.871
<v Speaker 1>have flying to spacing earth and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very prepared for it.</v>

12
00:00:51.911 --> 00:00:56.911
<v Speaker 1>So it was almost a completely a joyful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy,</v>

13
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>very exciting experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't have time or you know,</v>

14
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>any desire to think about what things</v>
<v Speaker 1>could go wrong.</v>

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first designer,</v>

16
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a design that won the Ansari x</v>

17
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>prize that was designed by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well Javier and space has been</v>

18
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:22.180
<v Speaker 1>commercialized by Virgin Galactic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>right now I think their plans are for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first commercial flights to take</v>

20
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>place in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that far away.</v>

21
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>And I think from there we will see a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more competition.</v>

22
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.640
<v Speaker 1>And I know many other companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

23
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>designing a new spacecraft for orbital</v>
<v Speaker 1>and snowboard resolve flights.</v>

25
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So as soon as we see competition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see the prices come down and</v>

26
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:50.631
<v Speaker 1>really an industry being created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think space travel is a dream for many</v>

27
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 1>my trip will be perceived differently by</v>
<v Speaker 1>different genders because uh,</v>

30
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>for women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>a lot of time not only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>space travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not accessible to everyone,</v>

33
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 1>but this even less accessible to women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a lot more barriers for them,</v>

34
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>especially if they live in countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>where things like space travel</v>

35
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>any science and technology related</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields would be considered a more male</v>

37
00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.310
<v Speaker 1>dominated male appropriate field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to show them that there is</v>

38
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>nothing preventing women or making them</v>
<v Speaker 1>less qualified to be involved in any of</v>

39
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>these fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the equally,</v>

40
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.820
<v Speaker 1>I think men also get very interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>because as I said,</v>

41
00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>the space is not accessible today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too many people.</v>

42
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And one of my goals as my involvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>through and sorry,</v>

43
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 1>x prize was to create the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone equally,</v>

44
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:55.574
<v Speaker 1>men and women.</v>

45
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.930
<v Speaker 1>I say that a woman's right is definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>a key issue because you also see a woman</v>

46
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>actually in a way being very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very active in this movement.</v>

47
00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been an issue,</v>

48
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>over the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and,</v>

51
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation sort of fluctuates.</v>

52
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a little bit easier and it gets</v>

53
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.820
<v Speaker 1>harder again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

54
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>overall I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:30.481
<v Speaker 1>women in Iran are very resilient and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>very proud of all the Iranian woman that</v>

56
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>are sending up for the rights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking out.</v>

57
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:34.730
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I hope that they will succeed and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>glad that the international community is</v>

59
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>paying attention and supporting them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

60
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>At Protea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.900
<v Speaker 1>what do you want it to do is build a</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform to be able to deliver Internet</v>

62
00:03:51.061 --> 00:03:54.800
<v Speaker 1>based application to the users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>in sort of a mass market environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their skill sets or where</v>

64
00:03:59.791 --> 00:04:02.310
<v Speaker 1>they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you want it to do that so they can</v>

65
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:06.750
<v Speaker 1>consume the information or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience or the application to any</v>

66
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that medium that they are used to using,</v>

67
00:04:09.781 --> 00:04:14.781
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a mobile or the TV or their</v>
<v Speaker 1>pc or any other devices that could be</v>

68
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:19.821
<v Speaker 1>created in a ubiquitous manner and</v>
<v Speaker 1>making information and services,</v>

69
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ubiquitously and simply available to</v>

70
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.791
<v Speaker 1>everyone will actually close the digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>gap that exists today between</v>

71
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>generations sometimes and create new</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities actually for current</v>

72
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:38.841
<v Speaker 1>application service providers to address</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit much larger market place and be</v>

73
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>able to design applications that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>more suited for this larger audience.</v>
