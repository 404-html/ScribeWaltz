1
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>But monetary policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that what the Fed has done so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

4
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>which is to provide investment banks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other financial institutions which have</v>

5
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.050
<v Speaker 1>played an important role in the economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an important role in the functioning</v>

6
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:35.471
<v Speaker 1>of the whole credit system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing them with access to liquidity</v>

7
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>with access to the Federal Reserve's</v>
<v Speaker 1>borrowing facility and some of the</v>

8
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>innovations that they have done in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect are very good.</v>

9
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that more cuts in federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds rate,</v>

10
00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are called for.</v>

11
00:00:49.341 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a significant risk of inflation</v>

12
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>in the current situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the Fed's monetary policy</v>

13
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>is not going to continue to cut short</v>
<v Speaker 1>term interest rates.</v>

14
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.250
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>that what the Fed did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

16
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:14.201
<v Speaker 1>in the case of bear stearns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm providing the and in the immediate</v>

17
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of the bear stearns collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed,</v>

18
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>providing access to the discount window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring facility for investment banks.</v>

19
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>That was the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that was an innovation and policy.</v>

20
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>And what I think needs to happen is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be some further thought</v>

21
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>given to the supervisory and regulatory</v>
<v Speaker 1>function of the Fed over institutions</v>

22
00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>like that to go along with this access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

23
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>to the feds credit</v>

24
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.540
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to not see political solutions to</v>

25
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>problems like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the independence of the</v>

26
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.140
<v Speaker 1>Federal Reserve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I do believe is that the next</v>

27
00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:06.141
<v Speaker 1>president ought to take some clues from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proposals that the treasury</v>

28
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:13.251
<v Speaker 1>secretary and this blue ribbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>commission just put forth to revise the</v>

29
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.430
<v Speaker 1>regulatory system for financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions and the economy.</v>

30
00:02:20.401 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that needs a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rethinking,</v>

31
00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>and I think the next president will take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seriously.</v>

32
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>We'll have to take that seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever that that is.</v>
