1
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a difficult challenge to figure out</v>

2
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>now what to do with this information</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mind sciences.</v>

3
00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 1>My prediction is that legal theory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in legal.</v>

4
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Cirrus in the law are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on this and struggling with this</v>

5
00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>and entangled in these difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions going forward for,</v>

6
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>for who knows how long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the,</v>

7
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things to be aware of is that</v>

8
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>in every area of law there exist a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the law and legal decision makers</v>

9
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.640
<v Speaker 1>recognize the power of situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they do the law changes the</v>

10
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 1>outcome of the law changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I teach tort law for example,</v>

11
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.910
<v Speaker 1>and we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>we are in tort law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very prone to say that people assumed</v>

13
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>the risk that they made choices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore they should bear the</v>

14
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 1>and we are also inclined not to allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>there to be liability,</v>

16
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.690
<v Speaker 1>where we think the parties could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

18
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.950
<v Speaker 1>So we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

19
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 1>if if you use someone else's stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have gained consent and you</v>

20
00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to pay.</v>

21
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 1>We may have to put you in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call this sort of property rule</v>

22
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:32.654
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

23
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are times when we say that doesn't</v>

24
00:01:37.671 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>apply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the situation actually played a</v>

25
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:44.780
<v Speaker 1>role that doesn't typically play a role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now we're going to adjust the</v>

26
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an example,</v>

27
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>a famous example in tort law is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>is the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.030
<v Speaker 1>a family out on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a boat,</v>

31
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 1>on a lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a sudden storm comes up and now this</v>

32
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>family is stuck in the middle of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>like and they need to get somewhere for</v>

33
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see a doc and they approached the</v>

34
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>dock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to get on it and they're</v>

35
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>pushed off right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now as a consequence of the person</v>

36
00:02:09.471 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>on the dock pushing them off something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

37
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:16.831
<v Speaker 1>that the person is generally entitled to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do because of it's their property.</v>

38
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 1>So property rule protection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boat slams against the shore,</v>

39
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>it's damaged and some of the people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>injured.</v>

40
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.500
<v Speaker 1>So that's at least a variation of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an actual,</v>

41
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>of an actual case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A tort law,</v>

42
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes that in those situations</v>

43
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:37.190
<v Speaker 1>where a storm comes up and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking to protect their lives,</v>

44
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>that it's not exactly their disposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's leading them.</v>

45
00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.750
<v Speaker 1>It's more their situation to our law</v>
<v Speaker 1>says then that you're permitted to use</v>

46
00:02:44.751 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 1>someone else's doc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.960
<v Speaker 1>and that if they do try to push you off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to have to compensate you</v>

48
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:54.020
<v Speaker 1>for the consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's an example of where the law</v>

49
00:02:54.021 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is adjusted to take situation into</v>

50
00:02:57.231 --> 00:02:59.530
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could take you through every of law.</v>

51
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>I won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>in part because I don't know them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I did,</v>

53
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:05.510
<v Speaker 1>I would take you through all of them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you that in every area of law there</v>

54
00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>is a place where situation comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the law has already struggled</v>

55
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>

56
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It's just particulate picked a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular sort of dividing line.</v>

57
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in contract law we say if someone</v>

58
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>puts a gun to your head and says you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>your money or your life and you give</v>

59
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>your wallet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not an enforceable contract.</v>

60
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't your disposition that led you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it.</v>

61
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>It was your situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we changed the law to reflect it.</v>

62
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>I think one a general way in which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>law is going to have to deal with this.</v>

63
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>It's going to have to slide a slide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sort of the dividing point between</v>

64
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>wind situation matters and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>disposition matters.</v>

65
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be difficult because</v>

66
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>there is some simplicity and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>and there's something affirming about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that if something bad has</v>

68
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 1>happened to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they chose it.</v>

69
00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>So there will be resistance to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the mind sciences are</v>

70
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>going to appeal to those who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to kind of a truth,</v>

71
00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.393
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

72
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to expand those circumstances in which</v>

73
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>we take s situation seriously.</v>

74
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do that and you begin thinking</v>

75
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>about problems like crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean that you're suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

77
00:04:21.611 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because criminal behavior was</v>

78
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>situationally cause we should set all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criminals free.</v>

79
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It's actually much more complicated than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

80
00:04:30.191 --> 00:04:31.930
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but its implications,</v>

81
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be quite concrete.</v>

82
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>So one thing it might do is it might</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest to you that if criminals behaved</v>

83
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a solution to changing that</v>

84
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:49.120
<v Speaker 1>behavior simply to say that those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be put behind bars because if</v>

85
00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>they are indeed moved by situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we might look at a number of</v>

86
00:04:52.781 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>situational factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of the classics that already</v>

87
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:59.530
<v Speaker 1>come to mind are things like poverty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger that might lead people to behave</v>

88
00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:03.040
<v Speaker 1>in criminal ways that we're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>change that behavior if we attribute</v>

89
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 1>what they did simply to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>dispositions and miss the fact that they</v>

90
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>were operating in an environment which</v>
<v Speaker 1>would lead many people,</v>

91
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>including perhaps ourselves to behave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way.</v>

92
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's focus on behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of an instrumentalist view of law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asking how can we change what people do</v>

94
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>that might lead us to change how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to criminal behavior to be sure</v>

95
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>we may put people behind bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but behind bars we may be less likely to</v>

96
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>say they are of a certain character and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore we just make them do their</v>

97
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:35.860
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing we can do.</v>

98
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we can change their situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind bars and maybe we can change the</v>

99
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.150
<v Speaker 1>situation of people who are not behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars to lead,</v>

100
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lead others,</v>

101
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>to engage in less of that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conduct.</v>

102
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:53.220
<v Speaker 1>A commitment to trying to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the actual problem,</v>

103
00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>I think entails a commitment to shedding</v>
<v Speaker 1>the simple just model.</v>

104
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>And one more concrete thing I would add</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is that</v>

105
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.920
<v Speaker 1>our institutions themselves are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are sort of sources of,</v>

106
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.050
<v Speaker 1>of situational influence.</v>

107
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.350
<v Speaker 1>And we have for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been blind to those situational</v>

108
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 1>influences and have assume that the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have operated as a function of</v>

109
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:25.880
<v Speaker 1>their disposition and not their</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions in part for that reason,</v>

110
00:06:25.881 --> 00:06:30.881
<v Speaker 1>I think we don't pay close attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in which there exists a</v>

111
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>competition over our institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A competition that changes our</v>

112
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:41.090
<v Speaker 1>institutions and in turn changes us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this might be everything from our</v>

113
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:44.180
<v Speaker 1>government congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our judiciary,</v>

114
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>whether whether judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>state judges,</v>

115
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:51.461
<v Speaker 1>for example or elected may have real</v>
<v Speaker 1>implications for the outcomes of the</v>

116
00:06:51.501 --> 00:06:53.990
<v Speaker 1>decisions and what the nature of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections are.</v>

117
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Whether money from large corporations or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other groups can influence those</v>

118
00:06:59.541 --> 00:07:02.180
<v Speaker 1>institutions is something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

119
00:07:02.181 --> 00:07:07.181
<v Speaker 1>we've been not inclined to ask very</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully in part because of our faulty</v>

120
00:07:07.461 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>view of the human animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say there are many concrete</v>

121
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 1>ways in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

122
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I sort of a more situationist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

123
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:21.670
<v Speaker 1>perspective might change the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The details of it though,</v>

124
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:26.060
<v Speaker 1>I think require first accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>kind of the nature of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

126
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more general,</v>

127
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.230
<v Speaker 1>a attempt on the part of many of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>best and brightest legal scholars and</v>

128
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:41.231
<v Speaker 1>young law students and indeed our judges</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help sort out exactly what this</v>

129
00:07:41.271 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
