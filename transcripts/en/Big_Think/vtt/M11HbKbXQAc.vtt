1
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>I think architects are more necessary</v>
<v Speaker 1>than ever because technology can</v>

2
00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes create the illusion that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>building can be created without a</v>

3
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>creative hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a creative idea behind it.</v>

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where technology has helped so far is in</v>

5
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>the building of extraordinary shapes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that architects can imagine.</v>

6
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was once possible to imagine strange and</v>

8
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 1>complicated shapes that were almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to build today.</v>

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Technology allows us to build almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything but the computer can't create</v>

10
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't make them up.</v>

11
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm an architect has to make them up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think about frank gary again,</v>

13
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is in many ways a very traditional</v>

14
00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 1>architect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>he designs on paper and with models and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the computer takes over.</v>

16
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Only later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a younger generation of</v>

17
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>architects who were using the computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>more as a design tool up and they're</v>

18
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>comfortable with letting the computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells them what to do a little bit more,</v>

19
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than merely how to make something</v>

20
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:25.641
<v Speaker 1>that their mind has invented a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where that's going to take</v>

21
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

22
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

23
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think of myself as all,</v>

24
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but I think I'm old enough to not sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of naturally feel that that's the way to</v>

25
00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also,</v>

26
00:01:37.141 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I hope smart enough not to rush to</v>
<v Speaker 1>judgment on it.</v>

27
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>So let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>were using the computer as an actual</v>
<v Speaker 1>design tool as opposed to an engineering</v>

29
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>and construction tool or as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitation tool where all that takes</v>

30
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe that in the same way</v>

32
00:02:00.151 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>that computers can be programmed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write music,</v>

33
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>to paint pictures to a write literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that there will be a time</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they will equal the creative genius</v>

35
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>of a human mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they suddenly can facilitate that</v>

36
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:25.521
<v Speaker 1>genius and that we're seeing already</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we can get sort of tired of crazy</v>

37
00:02:25.861 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>shapes all the time and we get numb to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

38
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>and if every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown</v>

40
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>wrote many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years ago,</v>

41
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if every building is extraordinary,</v>

42
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>well then they're really ordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>so that if the new ordinary just becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of frantic,</v>

44
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>frenetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated form a,</v>

45
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that we've achieved much</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

46
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty and the drama in any kind of</v>

47
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>urban environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of urban setting is in the way</v>

48
00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>in which different things play against</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

49
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you had a building like Frank Gary's</v>

50
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Walt Disney Hall in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>next door to another gehry building next</v>
<v Speaker 1>door to another,</v>

52
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the same thing.</v>

53
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or equally a powerful buildings by other</v>

54
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>architects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that you'd have a</v>

55
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>particularly appealing urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

56
00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>but in the same way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 1>a great cathedral in a European city</v>
<v Speaker 1>plays off against the everyday buildings</v>

58
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>that are there and becomes a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>punctuation mark,</v>

59
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

60
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>And the city scape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we should be doing.</v>

61
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>Is Technology going to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation to do too much all the time?</v>

62
00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may,</v>

63
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our,</v>

65
00:03:48.271 --> 00:03:53.271
<v Speaker 1>our growing awareness of urbanism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the idea of the city,</v>

66
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>which I think is better understood</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally today than it was 20 years</v>

67
00:03:58.691 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:00.681
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

69
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:03.260
<v Speaker 1>that sort of helps balance that off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

70
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're much more aware that the</v>

71
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>background building in fact can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that makes a city</v>
<v Speaker 1>really nice to be it.</v>

73
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 1>We think about Paris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:04:13.391 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're great monuments,</v>

75
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but then there's the kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary everyday Parisian building that</v>

76
00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>creates the urban fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the reasons it works</v>

77
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 1>so well is because the great monuments</v>
<v Speaker 1>play off in,</v>

78
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a really beautiful,</v>

79
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>sort of harmonic balance against the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>the background fabric.</v>
