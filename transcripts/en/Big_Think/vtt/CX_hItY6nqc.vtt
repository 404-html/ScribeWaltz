<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown cofounder,</v>

2
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.340
<v Speaker 1>big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I originally from Toronto and I actually</v>

3
00:00:16.341 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>don't think that it shaped me too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think my parents shaped me more than</v>

4
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>where I'm from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents are,</v>

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is our Schwann is American.</v>

6
00:00:25.881 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And so we were always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of us were Canadians growing up in</v>

7
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we always were a little bit of</v>

8
00:00:33.111 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>outsiders and so we kind of have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentality I think.</v>

9
00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.943
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

10
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.783
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>

11
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>my family is pretty creative and both my</v>
<v Speaker 1>siblings are actors and my sister is</v>

12
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 1>also a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of been in the blood and I</v>

13
00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>knew I wanted to do it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a question of having the</v>

15
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:04.011
<v Speaker 1>courage to kind of go and move to La and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start as an unpaid intern and a waitress</v>

16
00:01:05.101 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>and that type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

17
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

18
00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>I've just kind of known that I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

19
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of as precise event that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me this is what you will do that,</v>

20
00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

21
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

22
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>it did was sort of not about business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do something</v>

23
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had wanted to work in the</v>

24
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>entertainment and media field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so after I graduated from</v>

25
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I moved to France for a year.</v>

26
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>And while I was there I decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm really interested in film and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Television and that type of thing.</v>

28
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>So I moved back to Toronto very briefly</v>
<v Speaker 1>before moving to Los Angeles to work in</v>

29
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so while I was there,</v>

30
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't really want one to work my way</v>
<v Speaker 1>up the studio system.</v>

32
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>I'd actually like to be running things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and creating things and having creative</v>

33
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>say and what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I realized that all too often,</v>

34
00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>creative people don't really understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what they're doing is also a</v>

35
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they kind of need to be trained</v>

36
00:02:10.951 --> 00:02:14.760
<v Speaker 1>in that way to operate on the same level</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the business people.</v>

37
00:02:14.761 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>And so I figured I better get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>training in business and so went to</v>

38
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.450
<v Speaker 1>business school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't because I really wanted to</v>

39
00:02:21.451 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>be a business person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just that I wanted to understand</v>

40
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>what business people did so that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>participate.</v>

41
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
