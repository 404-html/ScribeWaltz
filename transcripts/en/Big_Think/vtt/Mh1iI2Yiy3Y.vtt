00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>As a poker player,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't have a consistent style and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful over time.</v>

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your opponents come to know how you play</v>

4
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>and they will devise a strategy to beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>you if there are any good.</v>

5
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>So while you can have over overarching</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendencies,</v>

6
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you really can't stick with one way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play and be successful.</v>

8
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's pretty much the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>for business.</v>

9
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>It's either evolve or die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your strategy at the poker table and in</v>

11
00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>tournaments has to evolve over time</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the circumstances in that</v>

12
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your strategy in business has to</v>

13
00:00:43.581 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>evolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your competitors are always trying to</v>

14
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>get the best of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't,</v>

15
00:00:48.591 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of holes that they open</v>

16
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 1>up or holes that they attempt to close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can be pretty sure that your</v>

17
00:00:55.371 --> 00:00:58.520
<v Speaker 1>business isn't going to last very long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same thing at the poker table.</v>

18
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 1>What a strategy that may be working</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly in the early stages of the</v>

19
00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>tournament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe suicide in the middle stages of</v>

20
00:01:05.511 --> 00:01:07.090
<v Speaker 1>the tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you always have to be both a aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your image at the table and,</v>

22
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's your opponent's think of you</v>

23
00:01:14.931 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then try to constantly rearrange</v>

24
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>your strategy so that they are doing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong thing against you at the right.</v>

25
00:01:21.931 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
