00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anybody should care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gossip.</v>

2
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>It put it on my site.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to read it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great thing about it is it's,</v>

4
00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.320
<v Speaker 1>I like to think of my website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Mcdonald's of the</v>

5
00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people love to criticize</v>

6
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>McDonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

7
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>it's still really popular and I love the</v>
<v Speaker 1>French fries.</v>

8
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I think gossip is</v>

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.690
<v Speaker 1>people's interest in gossip is nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>

10
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>It's been around for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been around for centuries.</v>

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that's changed is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media has become aware that a celebrity</v>

12
00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:55.481
<v Speaker 1>news can be profitable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so gossip or celebrity news is now</v>

13
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 1>mainstream news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

14
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>but I know that celebrity news is</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream news.</v>

15
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>I know that Anderson Cooper has</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed Lindsay Lohan many times and</v>

16
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.620
<v Speaker 1>he probably hates it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

17
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>He will continue to discuss about</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity news and he will continue to</v>

18
00:01:21.691 --> 00:01:26.691
<v Speaker 1>talk about Lindsay Lohan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not insult the mainstream news</v>

19
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>by saying that it's a form of glorified</v>
<v Speaker 1>gossip.</v>

20
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still think that mainstream news is</v>

21
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>very valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Invaluable.</v>

22
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:38.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.000
<v Speaker 1>Mainstream news is just doing their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they weren't making money,</v>

24
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.300
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't be able to provide us with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the news.</v>

25
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So they have to have that celebrity</v>
<v Speaker 1>element there so that they can get</v>

26
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

27
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all the times I,</v>

28
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are those shows that have nothing</v>

29
00:01:56.831 --> 00:02:00.700
<v Speaker 1>to do with politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's been a shift definitely over</v>

30
00:02:00.701 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>the last five or 10 years where there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more celebrity content in</v>

31
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 1>mainstream news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think celebrity news is only a</v>

32
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at it as,</v>

33
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspirational.</v>

34
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.610
<v Speaker 1>It's a great escape for people and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them love to fantasize.</v>

35
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:21.771
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

36
00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be great if I were famous to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

37
00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be great if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>go to that shop and buy that fancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes that Kim Kardashian buys.</v>
