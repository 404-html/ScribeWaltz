1
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had spiritual moments in a bland sense</v>

2
00:00:16.941 --> 00:00:18.290
<v Speaker 1>of that word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I suppose,</v>

3
00:00:18.291 --> 00:00:23.291
<v Speaker 1>but I think the right sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have times when I am just transported</v>

4
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>with awe and joy and a sense of peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>and wonder at whether it's music or art</v>

5
00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:31.784
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

6
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>or just a child playing or some other</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful thing off.</v>

7
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>And my sail boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 1>being amazed at the beauty of the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.760
<v Speaker 1>I think that people make the mistake of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that spirituality in that sense</v>

10
00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>has anything to do with either a</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious doctrines or with</v>

11
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>immateriality or the supernatural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>the world is a stunningly interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>and glorious place and at every scale</v>

13
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>and the are that one can experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>because one understands something about</v>

14
00:01:15.621 --> 00:01:20.621
<v Speaker 1>how the parts are put together is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think far greater than the sort of,</v>

15
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 1>or of incomprehension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just I think,</v>

16
00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the universe is much more wonderful the</v>

17
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>more you know about how it's put</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

18
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can change our brains,</v>

19
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through meditation.</v>

20
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>you can change your brain through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through doing crossword puzzles or,</v>

22
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reading a novel or through meditating</v>

23
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.800
<v Speaker 1>or through running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.420
<v Speaker 1>brains are stunningly adjustable</v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic,</v>

25
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organs and everything you do,</v>

26
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 1>it changes your brain a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you couldn't leave a trace of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do.</v>

28
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>He couldn't have any memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>so meditation is one actually very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of changing your brand.</v>

30
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:14.431
<v Speaker 1>I think meditation plays some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>roles that are played also by sleep of</v>

31
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.470
<v Speaker 1>restoring balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rid of tension and access and</v>

33
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>generally calming the whole system down</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that it can confront the world anew.</v>

34
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>It's a sort of a refreshment.</v>
