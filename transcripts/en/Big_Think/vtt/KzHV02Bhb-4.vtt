1
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>I think Americans obsessed a lot over</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrity.</v>

2
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>But I think the thing that I've written</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to remember is a small</v>

3
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

4
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an expression that they use</v>

5
00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>saying that you punch above your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means you kind of play with the</v>

6
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>big boys when you're not such a big boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Britain,</v>

7
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tries to be more of a kind of world</v>

8
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>figure than it may be is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it kind of wants to do an America</v>

9
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have as many celebrities.</v>

10
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.350
<v Speaker 1>as many serious things to fill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's paper with papers with as America</v>

12
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

13
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has this weird celebrity culture</v>

14
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>filled with not that important</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrities actually a lot of newspapers</v>

15
00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>that it has to sell and a lot of tablets</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are completely,</v>

16
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hollywoodized.</v>

17
00:01:00.781 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're all about kind of crap</v>
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>

18
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:06.471
<v Speaker 1>so you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

20
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>it's in the culture much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

21
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>there is a kind of lack of seriousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and discourse there because of all that.</v>

22
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really brought down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tone of a lot of the papers,</v>

23
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>all this celebrity stuff.</v>

24
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I interviewed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>right before the dark knight was</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapping.</v>

26
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I think he was in his last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>months of filming.</v>

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

28
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

29
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

30
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really good looking.</v>

31
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>A lot of movie actors aren't good</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at all when you meet them,</v>

32
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're much smaller than you would hope</v>

33
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

34
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I've nothing against short people but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

35
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.450
<v Speaker 1>but you're disappointed because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look the same as you want them to</v>

36
00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was like a big strapping,</v>

37
00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian guy.</v>

38
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he clearly was really bright,</v>

39
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>really creative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very restless.</v>

40
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

41
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>but charming and charming and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent and clearly having a tough</v>

42
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:07.240
<v Speaker 1>time with the filming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we talked about</v>

43
00:02:07.241 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>was insomnia because I suffer from</v>
<v Speaker 1>insomnia as well.</v>

44
00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>So we were sort of trading tips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

45
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>what kind of drugs to take and what kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

46
00:02:15.161 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques we used.</v>

47
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of hauntingly said,</v>

48
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been taking ambien and I took one</v>

49
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.630
<v Speaker 1>last night and it didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I took another one and then I only</v>

50
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>slept for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

51
00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mind is fizzing with this role.</v>

52
00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I cannot get my mind to shut up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't seem like he was,</v>

53
00:02:34.331 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on anything.</v>

54
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>He just seemed like he was clearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who was one of those people</v>

55
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who get so into his work that he</v>

56
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:47.341
<v Speaker 1>couldn't comment down those voices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were all excited and fizzy.</v>

57
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And so I felt just so sad at the way he</v>
<v Speaker 1>died because clearly he was talking</v>

58
00:02:53.021 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was clearly was a mistake,</v>

59
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:57.820
<v Speaker 1>I think because he just couldn't get any</v>
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>

60
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>And I know what that feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awful.</v>

61
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>And so it was just shocking because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed,</v>

62
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>he was so full of life and so lovely.</v>

63
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>And we talked about his daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

64
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little baby daughter.</v>

65
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>He just loved her and it was just such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>waste.</v>

66
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>It was so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

67
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had,</v>

68
00:03:13.951 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>would have had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he certainly wasn't suicidal.</v>

69
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>He was really full of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was so poignant.</v>

70
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>He was living in a beautiful rented</v>
<v Speaker 1>house in London,</v>

71
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>and it had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think three or four bedrooms.</v>

72
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>They took me on a tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful place,</v>

73
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and he showed me every single bed had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

74
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it was all messy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>all the sheets were everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

76
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>cause last night I just couldn't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went from bed to bed hoping I could</v>

77
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>fall asleep somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just so sad.</v>

78
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm just so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

79
00:03:41.831 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>you wonder if someone had really kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken him in hand and said,</v>

80
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.484
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

81
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>this movie's hurting your health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's try to work on this.</v>

82
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>If he could have been helped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>

83
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people are,</v>

84
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you can't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have answers,</v>

85
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>you can't really know what makes them</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick.</v>

87
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.861
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

88
00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a tragedy really.</v>
