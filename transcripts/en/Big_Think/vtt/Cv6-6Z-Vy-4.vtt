<v Speaker 1>but I must say today,</v>

50
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>the best advice I ever received is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

51
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I would say I received from myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's based upon my experiences</v>

52
00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and the best advice I received from Maya</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

53
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>if is follow your intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow your mind.</v>

54
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Cause mean many times I have not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen where I should have.</v>

55
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know each individual to each his</v>

56
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sometimes,</v>

57
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>not everybody's intuition is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an thing.</v>

58
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>But where I am today in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my intuition,</v>

59
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>I should follow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

60
00:03:18.401 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>that is the advice I get from that inner</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice inside of me.</v>

61
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

63
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.720
<v Speaker 1>And I must always listen to that device.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I did,</v>

64
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:30.310
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't get money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't be in general.</v>
