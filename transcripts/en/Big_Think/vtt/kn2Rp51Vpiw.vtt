1
00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Everything takes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know very few geniuses,</v>

2
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>very few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>who can just show up and be brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of us,</v>

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 1>we have to work hard there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no magic potion.</v>

5
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>There is no secret sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's work and that's a lot of work.</v>

6
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And not to be afraid of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but indulge in it.</v>

7
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Take it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be confident with it.</v>

8
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.193
<v Speaker 1>Work hard.</v>

9
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:36.783
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

10
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>There are certain things that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come and time,</v>

11
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

12
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.070
<v Speaker 1>experience is one of those things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes after time.</v>

13
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>You need the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can put yourself in a position</v>

14
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:59.761
<v Speaker 1>to gain experience by allowing yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to voluntarily be a beginner at</v>

15
00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I find that to be a very big character</v>
<v Speaker 1>trait,</v>

17
00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.910
<v Speaker 1>very admirable character trait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>when someone purposefully puts them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the selves in a position to be a</v>

19
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>beginner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the CEO of a major corporation says,</v>

20
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to snowboard.</v>

21
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this person,</v>

22
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>man or woman who is a commander of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>legions of people perhaps is now on,</v>

23
00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.840
<v Speaker 1>on the side of a mountain falling on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>or her ass and having a 16 year old kid</v>

24
00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>be the teacher.</v>

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>That's a fantastic position to put</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself in.</v>

26
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>And I think people should constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for ways to voluntarily put</v>

27
00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>themselves in a position of not knowing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being vulnerable,</v>

28
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.390
<v Speaker 1>of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to learn something here.</v>

29
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I want to be open to this and admit I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to snowboard.</v>

30
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.390
<v Speaker 1>Please teach me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have an experience and an empowering</v>

31
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>a millennial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a younger generation person to say,</v>

32
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.750
<v Speaker 1>you are my instructor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are my teacher,</v>

33
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.290
<v Speaker 1>please do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

34
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a beautiful thing for human</v>

35
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>beings to share is to reach out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

36
00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>you're the boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please show me the way.</v>

37
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

38
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.830
<v Speaker 1>there's power and confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I male on the other side of the the</v>

39
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>table now a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I produce and I direct and I,</v>

40
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:51.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>and I can really feel the difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone comes into a room with</v>

42
00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:57.604
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

43
00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

44
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>But I want to draw the distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between confidence and boastfulness.</v>

45
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>Someone who is figuratively pounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>their chest saying how great they are.</v>

46
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That's not confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

47
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.891
<v Speaker 1>that's it's egocentric behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes me push away someone who</v>

48
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>boasts about how great they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm leery about that.</v>

49
00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>But there's a quiet confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I tried to,</v>

50
00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.120
<v Speaker 1>to express to millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to younger generation of actors,</v>

51
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>directors,</v>

52
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>artists of any kind is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to value your talent.</v>

53
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>And I would say to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>

54
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>are you talented?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I hope you say yes.</v>

55
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.060
<v Speaker 1>That's not a boast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

56
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>it's being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you go out and tell everybody on the</v>

57
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:51.191
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

58
00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm talented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really talented.</v>

59
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for yourself.</v>

60
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:56.440
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

61
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>it's internal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can own that and you can value,</v>

62
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>greatly value your own contributions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

63
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>your intellect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination,</v>

64
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.740
<v Speaker 1>your humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever experience you have so far,</v>

65
00:04:14.741 --> 00:04:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll gain more experience.</v>

66
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Confident in that.</v>

67
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I sense confidence,</v>

68
00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.860
<v Speaker 1>I want more from that person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

69
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I do the reaching and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

70
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:36.051
<v Speaker 1>a great lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just came back from a Uso tour and</v>

71
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.090
<v Speaker 1>talking to only millennials and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

72
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>millennials have been maligned a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that,</v>

73
00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've been,</v>

74
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>you've been given the the bullshit line</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

75
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just want the trophy.</v>

76
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>You just want to show up and you'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trophy.</v>

77
00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>You're not really willing to work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

78
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>You're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I just don't buy into that.</v>

79
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Just don't listen to any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

80
00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>I was so impressed with these young men</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women in the military,</v>

81
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commanding great presence,</v>

82
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobility,</v>

83
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>kindness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife and I said,</v>

84
00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truly.</v>

85
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

86
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 1>if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this is the next generation of</v>

87
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:29.050
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be okay.</v>

88
00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>We really are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be fine.</v>

89
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I think every generation looks to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next one and says,</v>

91
00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not like us.</v>

92
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 1>We were better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys are fine,</v>

93
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 1>but there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is definite value in work.</v>

94
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>I knew that when I was starting out as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an actor,</v>

95
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I was all about work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

96
00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and I still am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

97
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>But that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the key.</v>

98
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find something that you love to</v>

99
00:05:57.531 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then when Monday comes along,</v>

100
00:06:00.501 --> 00:06:03.110
<v Speaker 1>you're not going Monday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

101
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get to act.</v>

102
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>That was great for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Mondays.</v>

103
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I love Mondays.</v>

104
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
