1
00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean Google of Rod is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:11.671
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

3
00:00:11.671 --> 00:00:13.200
<v Speaker 1>just recently rolled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.291
<v Speaker 1>integration of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

5
00:00:14.291 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 1>of realtime search and taking twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6
00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and status updates and putting that in</v>

7
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>as one of the options within the web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously,</v>

8
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just not just google news,</v>

9
00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but number different google properties</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all very curious and,</v>

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and beating to think through what does</v>

11
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>it mean for us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we take advantage of that?</v>

12
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I,</v>

13
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>the way I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

14
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>I think about it from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the new side of it,</v>

15
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

16
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>there are two aspects of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is just the content itself.</v>

17
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there value in those tweets,</v>

18
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.790
<v Speaker 1>or is it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is your sort of stream of information</v>

20
00:00:43.791 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 1>that by itself just adds more noise to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

21
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>I think there's probably some of both.</v>

22
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

23
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>that's a key part of what we try and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not just index the world's</v>

24
00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also trying to organize it in some</v>

25
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so applying that to real time</v>

26
00:00:56.751 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>information is very challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>so I think that that's one thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at the other part of is</v>

28
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>just simply as another signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a way of sort of picking up those</v>

30
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>tweets about a certain topic or linking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a certain story.</v>

31
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.450
<v Speaker 1>And is there a signal there that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful for us and trying to pick up</v>

32
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:14.600
<v Speaker 1>information quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to understand people's</v>

33
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>preferences for certain sources are for</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain stories.</v>

34
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so even if you never even surface</v>

35
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>that information that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the real time tweets that are</v>

36
00:01:22.521 --> 00:01:24.470
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you leverage those,</v>

37
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those signals to do a better job of</v>

38
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>presenting what you have on your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>

39
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>So I think both of those are areas that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're actively looking at and trying to</v>

40
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>figure out what's there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sure we'll put something out</v>

41
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.740
<v Speaker 1>there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the first iteration will,</v>

42
00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:37.850
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not work.</v>

43
00:01:37.851 --> 00:01:39.560
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's I think,</v>

44
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:41.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the fun part about trying</v>

45
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>to see how you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can move forward and that's a makes,</v>

46
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>makes things never dull.</v>

47
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.541
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in just a few seconds or minutes or</v>

49
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.881
<v Speaker 1>probably hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could explain what,</v>

50
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:56.714
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>what ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the idea behind wave that</v>

52
00:01:58.761 --> 00:01:59.630
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really interesting.</v>

53
00:01:59.631 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

54
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>if email didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you communicate?</v>

55
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I think that was sort of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

56
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:06.300
<v Speaker 1>the thought that a lot of the engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>started with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

58
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>with Google wave and really trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reimagine how people can communicate.</v>

59
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's part email,</v>

60
00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>it's part chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it's part collaborative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a collaborative documents.</v>

62
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of all these roll together.</v>

63
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of these things you need to</v>

64
00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>play around with it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really even begin to try and</v>

65
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>articulate what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's one of the things is that</v>

66
00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten a lot of interest from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>from journalists saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think this is really fits well with</v>

68
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>how we do our job.</v>

69
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.960
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is potentially a tool that we would</v>

70
00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:37.590
<v Speaker 1>want to take advantage of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>to tell stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create that to,</v>

72
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.740
<v Speaker 1>to create stories in a different way</v>
<v Speaker 1>than how we do it right now.</v>

74
00:02:42.741 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>Even though it sort of fits with the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>we gather facts and information and</v>

75
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>check and check sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>like how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we sort of met,</v>

77
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>migrate that to the web and make it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more of an,</v>

78
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.810
<v Speaker 1>of an open process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

79
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>I think wave is still at the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>stages,</v>

80
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and figure out how it's going to</v>

81
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:59.000
<v Speaker 1>be used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.430
<v Speaker 1>and journalism is just sort of one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that we've,</v>

83
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>we've seen a few different organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to play around with don't know</v>

84
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's ultimately gonna happen with,</v>

85
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>with either wave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

86
00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>the larger discussion and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically around around journalism.</v>

87
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.411
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly,</v>

88
00:03:16.411 --> 00:03:17.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things that I talked about,</v>

89
00:03:17.281 --> 00:03:19.380
<v Speaker 1>some of those trends in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about personalization,</v>

90
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:20.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

91
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.050
<v Speaker 1>and the social nature of news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.421
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.100
<v Speaker 1>I think those are things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.470
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had in bits and pieces,</v>

96
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:30.960
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we've necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten it all together.</v>

97
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tough.</v>

98
00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard when you talk about</v>

99
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:37.440
<v Speaker 1>personalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even explicit personalization is not</v>

100
00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>easy to do well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

101
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>and even if you get those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those signals from users,</v>

102
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to make sure that you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them right and you interpret them in the</v>

103
00:03:43.831 --> 00:03:45.600
<v Speaker 1>right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not an easy,</v>

104
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.330
<v Speaker 1>easy challenge to say nothing of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea of implicit</v>

105
00:03:48.331 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>personalization of just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come to the website,</v>

106
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.760
<v Speaker 1>you should know what I'm supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I want to read?</v>

107
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to say that,</v>

108
00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's even trickier.</v>

109
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:57.750
<v Speaker 1>So those are some of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

110
00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.340
<v Speaker 1>we're really thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how do you,</v>

111
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.560
<v Speaker 1>how do you present that in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

112
00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:02.610
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a meaningful way to our users?</v>

113
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>The balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think you don't want to have</v>

114
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:13.590
<v Speaker 1>the sort of echo chamber where you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting that same news and</v>

115
00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.440
<v Speaker 1>information from the same sources and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you've,</v>

116
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>you've always gotten before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

117
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.490
<v Speaker 1>I think you really want to try and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that balance of,</v>

118
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>of information that's personalized to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

119
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.550
