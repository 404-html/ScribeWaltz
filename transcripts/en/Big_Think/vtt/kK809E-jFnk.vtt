00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny in that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely a huge difference between how</v>

2
00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:17.111
<v Speaker 1>you just explained design in from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>market perspective and how you would</v>

3
00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:22.121
<v Speaker 1>explain design as the curator at Moma in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my world.</v>

4
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Design really is about beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about</v>

5
00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>how does this work fit in with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>collection?</v>

6
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>How does this look next to everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>else in my collection?</v>

7
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>It really has nothing to do with the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>form versus function debate.</v>

8
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ornament can still be crime in the,</v>

9
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the contemporary design movement.</v>

10
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>But the work itself is frequently an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ornament.</v>

11
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not about a work having ornament</v>
<v Speaker 1>applied to it.</v>

12
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>It's about the work itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimicking sculpture,</v>

13
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>mimicking contemporary art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the fundamental basis of</v>

14
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>contemporary design in the market world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other side of the coin,</v>

15
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>if I was to become a full on curator at</v>
<v Speaker 1>an institution,</v>

16
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>I would be far more concerned with good</v>
<v Speaker 1>design that question,</v>

17
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>what is good design and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

18
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>and form and function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thus one of my heroes,</v>

19
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:29.111
<v Speaker 1>one of my personal heroes over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years in terms of who is the most</v>

20
00:01:29.481 --> 00:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartest designer of our times,</v>

21
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.870
<v Speaker 1>to which I would say Jasper Morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison is not much of a presence in</v>

22
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 1>the market because everything he does is</v>
<v Speaker 1>so minimalist and so oriented towards</v>

23
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.890
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Making this piece work.</v>

24
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>You steps.</v>
