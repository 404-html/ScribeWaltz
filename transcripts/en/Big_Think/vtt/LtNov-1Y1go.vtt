00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.210
<v Speaker 1>When I was at Harvard Business School</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 1990,</v>

2
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>there were probably eight people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonprofit club.</v>

3
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we looked at slightly</v>

4
00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.600
<v Speaker 1>askance by the folks because it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>the venture capital club with the</v>

5
00:00:22.601 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>finance club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now today on campus,</v>

6
00:00:25.421 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the largest single club at Harvard</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business School is the social enterprise</v>

7
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 20 years or less than that,</v>

8
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you have had a shift in something pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental in this country around I</v>

9
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 1>think young people wanting to take more</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for those around them,</v>

10
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>seeing their responsibility slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>more broadly defined than just motivated</v>

11
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:52.291
<v Speaker 1>self interest in getting involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have so many more young folks in</v>

12
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:56.770
<v Speaker 1>our colleges and our Grad schools today</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentoring our students,</v>

13
00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 1>volunteering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting involved in service movements</v>

14
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>like Americorps and Vista.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

15
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the pendulum is certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>swinging to a direction where many young</v>

16
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:12.331
<v Speaker 1>people are taking more responsibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those around them and realizing</v>

17
00:01:13.361 --> 00:01:15.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not at odds with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 1>good old motivated self interest in free</v>
<v Speaker 1>market capitalism.</v>

19
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 1>we all remember that and Smith wrote a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book called the wealth of nations.</v>

21
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.400
<v Speaker 1>And talked about free markets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

22
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 1>why they were good ultimately for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

23
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>He also wrote another book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was talking about the theory of moral</v>

24
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.360
<v Speaker 1>essentials in what he said is you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a free market in,</v>

25
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>it's going to work best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

26
00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:45.121
<v Speaker 1>at some point you have to realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting more and more and more is</v>

27
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>actually not in society's best interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even Adam Smith as our free market</v>

28
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>free market economies would say there's</v>

29
00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>a concept of being responsible for</v>
<v Speaker 1>others in wrote a book about that.</v>

30
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Equally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we are.</v>

31
00:02:00.611 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Don't remember he actually wrote a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

32
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:07.201
<v Speaker 1>One of them talked about moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentials in the danger of just seeing</v>

33
00:02:07.421 --> 00:02:12.421
<v Speaker 1>in a creative process without any sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's enough or any sense of</v>

34
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>distribution that I have the opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>now to help others.</v>

35
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:17.891 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 1>that's equally part of keeping a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>

37
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

38
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.800
<v Speaker 1>in well functioning capitalist society</v>
<v Speaker 1>in check.</v>

39
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>Certainly many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more Grad schools are offering loan</v>

40
00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness or loan reduction for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into the nonprofit sector.</v>

41
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do think with the rise of social</v>

42
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of nonprofits hiring better and</v>

43
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>better people growing more quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're attracting incredible talent</v>

44
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.080
<v Speaker 1>into the sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is is people are getting</v>

45
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>paid more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the gap between the nonprofit and</v>

46
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:53.400
<v Speaker 1>private sector is shrinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly the last 10 years it's</v>

47
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 1>shrinking from when I started back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000.</v>

48
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other way I think about the is I'm</v>

49
00:03:01.211 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>not a huge proponent of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of handouts,</v>

50
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>so I have not seen with people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>able bodied enable minded,</v>

51
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.910
<v Speaker 1>they were handouts are producing good</v>
<v Speaker 1>outcomes in a sense of entitlement is a</v>

52
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>very destructive sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you ever want to play the victim,</v>

53
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get a hit.</v>

54
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>So when I think about that pendulum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

55
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of personal accountability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to be invested in any nonprofit</v>

56
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is serving someone who is</v>

57
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>able bodied enabled minded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are needs for charitable acts or</v>

59
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.180
<v Speaker 1>needs for handouts for someone who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cannot provide for themselves or</v>

60
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>we slipped to a place where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally cannot take care of</v>

61
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a majority.</v>

62
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what we're trying to do here,</v>

63
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>especially at Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We believe you've got to combine deep</v>

64
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>personal accountability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking charge of yourself.</v>

65
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Not saying woe is me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but saying I want a chance.</v>

66
00:03:56.981 --> 00:03:58.420
<v Speaker 1>I want an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

67
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>America needs to be an opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

68
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And so the young adults we serve want an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>

69
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>They do not want a handout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want a hand up.</v>

70
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And so my belief is that pendulum in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of maybe reaching out and</v>

71
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>supporting others also has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced by a healthy dose of personal</v>

72
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>accountability for those being helped in</v>
<v Speaker 1>without.</v>

73
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Which I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the system will ever work</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
