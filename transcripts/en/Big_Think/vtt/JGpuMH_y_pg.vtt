<v Speaker 1>Dave chappelle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave's my God brother.</v>

2
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.690
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a bit biased and we came of age</v>
<v Speaker 1>together in New York City,</v>

3
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>being in college and him at the Boston</v>
<v Speaker 1>Comedy Club,</v>

4
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>which is a college of sorts for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I was actually known to some as Dave's</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rican bodyguard because,</v>

6
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

7
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know exactly what to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

8
00:00:28.971 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the guy who didn't smile much and</v>

9
00:00:30.771 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>just sat in the back of the club club</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading books.</v>

10
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't realize that that was at</v>

11
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:36.440
<v Speaker 1>Columbia University.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way I can have the</v>

12
00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 1>privilege hanging out the comedy club as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I actually read books while somebody</v>

13
00:00:40.251 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>else was telling jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So say,</v>

14
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave.</v>

15
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Dave's definitely my favorite comic.</v>

16
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
