1
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>I guess all Americans have a favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>period of American history.</v>

2
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine is the period of the founding</v>

3
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>I've really been quite enchanted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

5
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>We were a very small country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or 5 million people,</v>

6
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>but we produced in a period of a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years a flowering of political changes.</v>

7
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Just remarkable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think unprecedented really in the</v>

8
00:00:39.361 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I like all of them.</v>

9
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess I've read a good bit about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the giants.</v>

10
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>But my particular favorite is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>James Madison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Madison of course did not have all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

13
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>the tenure as president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was the father of the</v>

14
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been a kind of attracted to him</v>

15
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>because I've always felt that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>he could never have gotten elected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress.</v>

17
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 1>He was a small man about five foot tall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had a pockmarked face.</v>

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>He was a lousy speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>on television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd had been a disaster.</v>

20
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a political genius because he</v>

21
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>was able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>put together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you would,</v>

23
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 1>large portions of the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my interest has really been with the</v>

24
00:01:36.031 --> 00:01:37.920
<v Speaker 1>founding fathers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have others.</v>

25
00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:42.000
<v Speaker 1>I admire Lincoln of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all Americans I admire.</v>

26
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the founding fathers,</v>

27
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel a deep,</v>

28
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>deep sense of appreciation for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>because of what they did.</v>

30
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question I would repeatedly get when</v>

31
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.890
<v Speaker 1>I was conducting public meetings in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indiana was where the leaders,</v>

32
00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the question you just asked and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's a hundred minds of an awful</v>

33
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>lot of Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are the Lincolns,</v>

34
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>the Jeffersons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Washingtons?</v>

35
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know that I know the answer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

36
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:20.631
<v Speaker 1>but I think part of the answer may be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the country is just a lot more</v>

37
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:26.550
<v Speaker 1>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more difficult to govern today</v>

38
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>because of its size and because of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversity,</v>

39
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>because of the acceleration if you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>have life,</v>

40
00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the political skill that is most</v>

41
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.370
<v Speaker 1>needed in this presidential election or</v>
<v Speaker 1>any political election from my point of</v>

42
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:49.821
<v Speaker 1>view is the ability to build consensus</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a solution.</v>

43
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 1>It's not very hard really to walk into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>room of people where you're discussing a</v>

44
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.901
<v Speaker 1>difficult issue and blow it apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not very hard because I've</v>

45
00:03:03.701 --> 00:03:08.701
<v Speaker 1>done it on a few occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is really hard is to walk into that</v>

46
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:13.801
<v Speaker 1>room and to build a consensus behind a</v>
<v Speaker 1>solution to the problem that you're</v>

47
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:19.051
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is political skill and that is the</v>

48
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>skill most needed in this great big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diverse,</v>

49
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:27.901
<v Speaker 1>complicated country with all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicting interests that we have</v>

50
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>consensus building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I look for in a politician.</v>

51
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>I think we've got a lot of work to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:47.371
<v Speaker 1>I think we've had quite a setback and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not used that power as wisely and</v>

53
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>prudently and effectively as we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>have used it,</v>

54
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>particularly with regard to the war in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>

55
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>But this is behind us now and we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are where we are.</v>

56
00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't change recent events and recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

57
00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>So I think we have to apply American</v>
<v Speaker 1>power pragmatically.</v>

58
00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistically,</v>

59
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to make sure that</v>

60
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>we do not set goals for ourselves that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot achieve.</v>

61
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>When President Bush said we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>end tyranny in the world,</v>

62
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is idealism beyond reach.</v>

63
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>When President Kennedy said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must bear any burden,</v>

64
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is beyond reach.</v>

65
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.110
<v Speaker 1>It's an ideal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is matching resources to</v>

66
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>achieve your goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Americans I think have tended to</v>

67
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:52.291
<v Speaker 1>overreach in the world and to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our power is so great that we can</v>

68
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.440
<v Speaker 1>achieve all kinds of things.</v>

69
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have become impressed with the</v>

70
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 1>limitations of American power and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of matching our goals with</v>

71
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:13.951
<v Speaker 1>the means to achieve those goals and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply for ourselves pragmatic objectives</v>

72
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.910
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achievable objectives and to,</v>

73
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.320
<v Speaker 1>to think that we can suddenly make</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy bloom in Saudi Arabia and</v>

74
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>is is a stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't do it,</v>

76
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also impressed that American</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideals are good and solid,</v>

77
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>but we cannot accomplish them without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of help.</v>

78
00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.200
<v Speaker 1>If you sit down and try to name the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult problems that bother you.</v>

79
00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A climate change,</v>

80
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.290
<v Speaker 1>conflicts of all kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rising tensions in the world,</v>

82
00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>HIV aids,</v>

83
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear proliferation,</v>

84
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to be impressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think with the fact that you cannot</v>

85
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.770
<v Speaker 1>achieve those goals by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to have held as big as we are,</v>

86
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>as smart as we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as rich as we are.</v>

87
00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>We need help and we have to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work together.</v>

88
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>The great</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius of American diplomacy,</v>

89
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came about it,</v>

90
00:06:26.611 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>at least in my lifetime after World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>II,</v>

91
00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.260
<v Speaker 1>when the idealism of the American people</v>
<v Speaker 1>was captured pragmatically and we</v>

92
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:42.310
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans leading the way of course,</v>

93
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>but with our health and we had this</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowering of diplomacy,</v>

94
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 1>the World Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the IMF,</v>

95
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>what eventually came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became the WTO,</v>

96
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>the World Trade Organization of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United Nations.</v>

97
00:06:56.571 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

98
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:03.730
<v Speaker 1>we advanced American interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did it by cooperating with other</v>

99
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>countries around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did not say this is the way it's</v>

100
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the American model.</v>

101
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do it our way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to impose it upon you.</v>

102
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:20.170
<v Speaker 1>We rejected that and we took the</v>
<v Speaker 1>generosity of the American public.</v>

103
00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Just think for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We defeated Japan and Germany.</v>

104
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They were the great evil at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiddler Tojo.</v>

105
00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Some people were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that the emperor of Japan,</v>

106
00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 1>after the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we immediately turned around immediately</v>

107
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>and gave aid to those countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a remarkable thing to think of that</v>

108
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:51.010
<v Speaker 1>we gave aid to the people we had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting for years.</v>

109
00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you capture that spirit again,</v>

110
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 1>that generosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that pragmatism,</v>

111
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.570
<v Speaker 1>that ability to advance your interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also include the interest of others?</v>

112
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>That's the great challenge for us.</v>

113
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to say leadership.</v>

114
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.820
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to say that.</v>

115
00:08:16.821 --> 00:08:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've lost a little bit of that</v>

116
00:08:18.891 --> 00:08:20.420
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:08:20.421 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.340
<v Speaker 1>predecessors had after World War II.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lack their generosity of spirit</v>

119
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magnanimity uh,</v>

120
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.710
<v Speaker 1>we've got to try to recapture that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we,</v>

121
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 1>if we're really going to be the leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

122
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.890
<v Speaker 1>we can't sit down at the international</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference table and say,</v>

123
00:08:39.891 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the agenda.</v>

124
00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 1>We're going to dictate the agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to sit down at that table and</v>

125
00:08:47.691 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 1>promote our agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be,</v>

126
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:54.260
<v Speaker 1>fighting terrorism or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've also got to sit there and</v>

127
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>listen to what the other side has to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

128
00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Don't necessarily have to agree with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to make a lot of concessions,</v>

129
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.890
<v Speaker 1>but you do have to try to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand it,</v>

130
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>to accommodate it if possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if not defined areas where you can</v>

131
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>agree and work on those where you cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree.</v>
