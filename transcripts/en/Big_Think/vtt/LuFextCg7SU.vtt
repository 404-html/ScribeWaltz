00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
<v Speaker 1>If you talk to a foreign policy expert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military expert,</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>not somebody who spends their time</v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on civil liberties but hardcore</v>

3
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.064
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy,</v>

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 2>very often they'll tell you that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first thing the next president has to do</v>

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 2>is close the facility at Guantanamo Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has done an calculable damage to the</v>

6
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>strength and security of the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States and our reputation all around the</v>

7
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:34.351
<v Speaker 2>world to have torture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have people kidnapped by our</v>

8
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what's called extraordinary</v>

9
00:00:37.481 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 2>rendition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have the president and the people who</v>

10
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 2>worked for the president saying in</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect,</v>

11
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 2>the law doesn't apply to them when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States acts this way,</v>

12
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 2>we lose our moral force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has always been one of our</v>

13
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.690
<v Speaker 2>great sources of strength around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

14
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to protect the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States that don't require trashing the</v>

16
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much the individual rights</v>

17
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 2>of the people who are detained at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guantanamo Bay though that's important.</v>

18
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 2>It's also the whole system of</v>
<v Speaker 2>constitutional checks and balances,</v>

19
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.200
<v Speaker 2>which is the key way we keep our</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy working.</v>

20
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.461
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

21
00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 2>when you have a president and a congress</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the president,</v>

22
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 2>especially who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wants to use their power,</v>

23
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a surprise that after September</v>

24
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>11th power flowed to the executive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that often happens after crisis.</v>

25
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.590
<v Speaker 2>It often happens too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's often an overreaction.</v>

26
00:01:35.591 --> 00:01:38.200
<v Speaker 2>And then we kind of correct it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's happened throughout the</v>

27
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>country's history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not a surprise that there would</v>

28
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:44.290
<v Speaker 2>be that kind of power surge after</v>
<v Speaker 2>September 11th,</v>

29
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.840
<v Speaker 2>and the abuses by Bush and Cheney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or not even necessarily the worst in the</v>

30
00:01:49.841 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 2>country's history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's different and very alarming</v>

31
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.790
<v Speaker 2>and really almost unheard of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is their argument,</v>

32
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 2>which is that this is not power that</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Bush has because of some</v>

33
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 2>emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not temporary.</v>

34
00:02:06.161 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 2>It's not just because of the emergency</v>
<v Speaker 2>of fighting terrorism.</v>

35
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.710
<v Speaker 2>It's inherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They argue in the presidency.</v>

36
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.390
<v Speaker 2>They argued that the presidency has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>power of what Dick Cheney called</v>

37
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 2>monarchical prerogatives of the kings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically the president.</v>

38
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.220
<v Speaker 2>Any president has the power of King</v>
<v Speaker 2>George as if we didn't fight a</v>

39
00:02:27.221 --> 00:02:31.900
<v Speaker 2>revolution precisely to overcome that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

40
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

41
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.040
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing more dangerous that this</v>

42
00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 2>administration has done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the theory of presidential power</v>

43
00:02:39.791 --> 00:02:40.624
<v Speaker 2>that they've pushed,</v>

44
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.920
<v Speaker 1>which left unchecked would change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of life.</v>

45
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
