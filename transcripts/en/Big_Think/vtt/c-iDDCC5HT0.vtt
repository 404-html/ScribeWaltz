1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>One of the most surprising things I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that people learn when you study</v>

2
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>perception and you look at the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we can be influenced,</v>

3
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as perceivers by stereotypes that we</v>

4
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>don't even believe are true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to be racist or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or be a chauvinist or be at any,</v>

6
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>any kind of a bad person to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by stereotypes.</v>

7
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It turns out all you need to do is know</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stereotype to be influenced by it.</v>

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Stereotypes really are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>are an example of categorization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brains are,</v>

10
00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human brains have evolved to be very</v>

11
00:00:40.021 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>rapid categorizes of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what allows us to interact with our</v>

12
00:00:43.921 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>world so smoothly and effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>So you can go into a room and see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair for the first time and you know</v>

14
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>that it's for sitting and not for eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>or climbing because you identify it as a</v>

15
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.760
<v Speaker 1>member of the category.</v>

16
00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stereotypes are categories of people and</v>

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>sometimes they're actually very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have stereotypes of what police</v>

18
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>officers are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Librarians are nurses are like.</v>

19
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And those stereotypes allow us to fill</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the blanks a little bit and know</v>

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>without even talking to a member of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>profession,</v>

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>something about what their job is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how I'm supposed to interact with them,</v>

22
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.710
<v Speaker 1>what it's reasonable to ask of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>how our interaction is probably going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

24
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>The problem of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that every stereotype is a</v>

25
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>generalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the done never applies completely</v>

26
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>accurately to any one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes stereotypes are just flat</v>

27
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>out wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>

29
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>they're just absolutely a unnecessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative and completely untrue.</v>

30
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>And yet we are affected by them because</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

31
00:01:43.681 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>that's one of these phase one perception</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that,</v>

32
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.100
<v Speaker 1>that the activation of stereotypes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mind is odd,</v>

33
00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>relatively automatic.</v>

34
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a female scientist and there are</v>

35
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes about women not being as</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable in science and mathematics.</v>

36
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:01.290
<v Speaker 1>So I like to get right out in front with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you know,</v>

37
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>show them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrate my expertise in science and</v>

38
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:06.270
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that I can counter that</v>

39
00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:09.360
<v Speaker 1>stereotype before it has a chance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>negatively affect their view of me.</v>

40
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Particularly when the perceiver isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>really motivated to be accurate about</v>

41
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>you or is only getting really a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quick glimpse of you when they're</v>

42
00:02:17.281 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>really kind of busy thinking about other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

43
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>That's when all of these things are at</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sort of the highest danger of,</v>

44
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>of influencing and getting in the way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being seen the way you really want to.</v>

45
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>So as as the person who is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived really what you want to be</v>

46
00:02:31.591 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>able to do is get that other person to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to see you accurately.</v>

47
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>The the best ways to do that are to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person to work with you in some way</v>

48
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 1>or to get that person to to to to notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can help them reach their</v>

49
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another really great way to get</v>

50
00:02:49.321 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>people to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of get past the initial</v>

51
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>assumptions and really take a second</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at you.</v>

52
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.320
<v Speaker 1>So be someone who's instrumental in</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping other people reach their goals</v>

53
00:02:58.321 --> 00:03:01.650
<v Speaker 1>and they're going to be much more likely</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to see the real.</v>

54
00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
