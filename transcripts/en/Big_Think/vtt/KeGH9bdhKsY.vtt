00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history has tended to move people toward</v>

2
00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>mutual acceptance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

3
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

4
00:00:17.051 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>the moral compass has expanded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you compare us to the time back when</v>

6
00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>people in one hunter gatherer village</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought the people in the next village</v>

7
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>or subhuman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that continued</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress is,</v>

9
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>is guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is guaranteed?</v>

11
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And this is what's interesting to me and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

12
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>this is what leads me to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

13
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not crazy to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>there's some larger purpose with a moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimension unfolding through human</v>

15
00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:51.761
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

16
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:56.761
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting to me is that the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>history seems seems to kind of be set</v>

17
00:00:56.771 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I know set up is kind of a</v>

18
00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>biased a term because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that any anybody or things</v>

19
00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>set it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

20
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

21
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:09.661
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the system works is that if</v>

22
00:01:09.761 --> 00:01:13.360
<v Speaker 1>people don't make the moral progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay a price.</v>

23
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right now in the history of the</v>

24
00:01:15.281 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people in the different abrahamic</v>

25
00:01:18.101 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>faiths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam,</v>

26
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>Judaism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christianity,</v>

27
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.590
<v Speaker 1>don't get better at accepting one</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

28
00:01:23.591 --> 00:01:27.280
<v Speaker 1>don't get better at tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be really bad for the world on an</v>

29
00:01:27.281 --> 00:01:28.570
<v Speaker 1>epic scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can be talking about the collapse of</v>

31
00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.330
<v Speaker 1>the society and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I think this is built into the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen it time and time and time</v>

33
00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that history forces people to either</v>

34
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>expand their moral compass or pay the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price.</v>

35
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.190
<v Speaker 1>And so all I can say for sure is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 1>for pretty sure is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think the salvation of the world</v>

37
00:01:54.521 --> 00:01:56.620
<v Speaker 1>in the sense of just holding the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

38
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having some degree of peace and order,</v>

39
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on further moral progress.</v>

40
00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that the outcome will</v>

41
00:02:06.671 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>be good.</v>

42
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.220
<v Speaker 1>But it's interesting to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the system drives,</v>

43
00:02:12.221 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>drives us toward this point where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>either make the moral progress or we pay</v>

44
00:02:15.971 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>the price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually reminiscent of</v>

46
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>something that various biblical prophets</v>
<v Speaker 1>were kind of saying in one sense or</v>

47
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not just biblical prophets.</v>

48
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

49
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.301
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed,</v>

50
00:02:28.301 --> 00:02:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I would say abrahamic prophets in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>

51
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.810
<v Speaker 1>A common message is to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>salvation is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So long as you align yourself more</v>

53
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>closely with the moral axis of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

54
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Now usually these profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't use the term moral access to</v>

55
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they use the term God,</v>

56
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but they did think of God as the moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>axis of the universe.</v>

57
00:02:52.541 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're secular,</v>

58
00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

59
00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still that the salvation of the</v>

60
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>world and this concrete sense of holding</v>
<v Speaker 1>it together,</v>

61
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to depend on humanity,</v>

62
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>aligning it self more closely with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral axis,</v>

63
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe.</v>

64
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>If you agree with me that that access</v>
<v Speaker 1>involves things like,</v>

65
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance of people who are different</v>

66
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>from you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and overcoming,</v>

67
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prejudices and biases.</v>

68
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
