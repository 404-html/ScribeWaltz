1
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>What we're thinking about things we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>already seeing.</v>

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>warm air holds more water vapor than</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere is about 5% more moisture</v>

5
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>in it then it had 40 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an astonishingly large change</v>

6
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>in a basic physical parameter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>that means that we're seeing huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>increases in the amount of day and</v>

8
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>downpour and flood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a record rainfall and flood</v>

9
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>event someplace around the world almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>every week.</v>

10
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hundred year storm comes to many</v>

11
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:38.850
<v Speaker 1>places every three or four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.520
<v Speaker 1>it's taking a great toll on</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>

13
00:00:41.521 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>on human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>if this spring we watched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of people killed in Rio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of Rio de Janeiro in mud</v>

16
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>slides after the largest rainstorms</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd ever recorded in that city.</v>

17
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>look at the chemistry of seawater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:00:59.341 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>the ocean is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our metaphor for vastness on this</v>

20
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that hasn't stopped it from changing</v>

21
00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>in profound ways.</v>

22
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.470
<v Speaker 1>See waters 30% more acidic and it was 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 50 years ago because the oceans are</v>

23
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>absorbing so much carbon from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>

24
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>Everything frozen on earth is melting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glaciers are melting with great</v>

25
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>rapidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>all over the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have disappeared in the</v>

27
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.310
<v Speaker 1>western us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Andes.</v>

28
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>you can go on for many days just listing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects we've already seen.</v>

30
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>If we don't do things quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects that are coming as the</v>

31
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>temperature gets hotter and hotter will</v>
<v Speaker 1>be even more dramatic.</v>

32
00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest studies indicate that by the</v>

33
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>mid to latter part of the century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could be seeing grain yields for corn</v>

34
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>and soybean and wheat fall 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

35
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:55.450
<v Speaker 1>40%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>that would be trouble of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>a all encompassing sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new planet.</v>

38
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>We need new habits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ways of going about things.</v>

39
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.050
<v Speaker 1>The biggest habit on our planet at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment is a kind of,</v>

40
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction to economic growth and to the</v>

41
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 1>idea that growth will solve every</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that we face.</v>

42
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a habit we're going to have to</v>

43
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>habit of mind really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going to have to get out of.</v>

44
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've reached those limits to growth</v>

45
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>that people started talking about it in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1970s when you melt the Arctic,</v>

46
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty good sign that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone too far.</v>

47
00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to need to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead how to build a world that is</v>

48
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secure,</v>

49
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 1>kinda hunker down that's built for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>built for endurance,</v>

51
00:02:50.991 --> 00:02:53.060
<v Speaker 1>not for speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a con.</v>

52
00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that means more and more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>our economies will need to become more</v>

53
00:02:57.111 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 1>localized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less sprawling,</v>

54
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less vulnerable,</v>

55
00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>more resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see that starting slowly to</v>

56
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of farms in the United States</v>

57
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>increased last five years for the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in a century and a half.</v>

58
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And it's because there's this local food</v>
<v Speaker 1>movement that's building up that kind of</v>

59
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>resilience in place after place.</v>
