1
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>I had been a journalist for about eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half years.</v>

2
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of an accidental journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never really intended to be a</v>

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>journalist side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>was fortunate enough to fall into a job</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the New York times when I got out of</v>

5
00:00:13.471 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a great experience when</v>

6
00:00:15.961 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>you're in your twenties to see the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and meet interesting people and be</v>

7
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>involved with interesting issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as time went on,</v>

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I never really thought about what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do with my life.</v>

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see what it's like in effect</v>

11
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the curtain to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to actually be the one</v>

12
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>doing the deals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just writing about the deals.</v>

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided as kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment to go try it,</v>

14
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 1>thinking I would do it for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and if it didn't work out,</v>

15
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>if I wasn't any good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

16
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>if I didn't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could come back to journalism and I</v>

17
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.880
<v Speaker 1>ended up staying 25 years.</v>

18
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I think journalism today is in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting place.</v>

19
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote in my book about some of my</v>

20
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:02.370
<v Speaker 1>grievances being on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the line from the</v>

21
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>journalist in terms of how I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism has changed in the 30 years,</v>

22
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>roughly since I was in Washington as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>

23
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I think it has become much more</v>

24
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>game of spinning and being spun much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more game of.</v>

25
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>and I think all of that is part of why</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tonality in our society is pretty</v>

27
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>rough at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

28
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame journalists for all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't blame the government for all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

30
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>but I think there is a shared</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that right now isn't</v>

31
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>being discharged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's been a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dumbing down of journalism.</v>

33
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>I think the whole sound byte journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>the blogosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cable,</v>

35
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>the hyperventilated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable TV journalism,</v>

36
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how great any of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was just a few minutes ago having</v>

37
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>a conversation with someone about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side of the coin,</v>

38
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>which is you had this enormous pro</v>
<v Speaker 1>proliferation of journalistic outlets,</v>

39
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>like big thing that didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't exist a few years ago.</v>

40
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>And so in the course of trying to sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book,</v>

41
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been interviewed by all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>media outlets that didn't exist and as I</v>

42
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't have existed a few years ago</v>

43
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's a kind of golden age of</v>

44
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>journalism that there are so many more</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways now to communicate and learn</v>

45
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I certainly wouldn't hesitate to tell</v>

46
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:18.240
<v Speaker 1>a friend or a child to go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism,</v>

47
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>but I think you really have to pick your</v>
<v Speaker 1>spots and know what you're in for.</v>

48
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.510
<v Speaker 1>My whole career in finance was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>from bigger firms to smaller firms and</v>

49
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>at each step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step of the way,</v>

50
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:36.420
<v Speaker 1>all I wanted was to be part of a small</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of very talented people on every</v>

51
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.720
<v Speaker 1>firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I joined got bigger and so finally I</v>

52
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.170
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 1>starting our own firm would be the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>great thing to do.</v>

54
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>It was a point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was in the year 2000 when it was</v>

55
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>relatively easy to start a firm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of capital,</v>

56
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of investors around and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

57
00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no sense of accomplishment like</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting a firm or a business as I'm</v>

58
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 1>sure you're finding a from scratch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching it succeed and grow and thrive.</v>

59
00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>If you want to be an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a wonderful thing to aspire to,</v>

60
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are several things you have to</v>

61
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

62
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>you have to be completely committed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted to that enterprise or project or</v>

63
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>whenever you take on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something to do in your spare</v>

64
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something to do while you have</v>

65
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>a couple of other careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something to do.</v>

66
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>While you write your first novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something you've just got to do.</v>

67
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is you've got to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong constitution.</v>

68
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>There will be bumps in the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be ups and downs,</v>

69
00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may well be complete failure.</v>

70
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Many entrepreneurial ventures fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>you have to accept that that is part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>

72
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 1>And failure is not the end of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the end of the world.</v>

73
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you just have to be willing to roll</v>

74
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>with the punches and take risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to basically be a risk taker.</v>

75
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Many people spend their entire careers</v>
<v Speaker 1>happily in established organizations</v>

76
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have the tolerance</v>
<v Speaker 1>for risk.</v>

77
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>I frankly never thought I would have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance for risk.</v>

78
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I've always been part until we started</v>
<v Speaker 1>our firm of,</v>

79
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an established large organization.</v>

80
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>But having been part of now one startup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's nothing else quite like</v>

81
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.801
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it works,</v>

82
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>and I could easily imagine doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
