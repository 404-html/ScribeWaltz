1
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.260
<v Speaker 1>All the experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by that I mean the NYP dea and the FBI</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>agree I should be dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somehow I managed to get through</v>

3
00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:17.260
<v Speaker 1>this horrendous experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>I stayed very calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I stopped,</v>

5
00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 1>I thought I listened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do anything without calculating</v>

6
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power and the impact of my words.</v>

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.070
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley,</v>

8
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.420
<v Speaker 1>it's your birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

9
00:00:31.421 --> 00:00:33.370
<v Speaker 1>You deserve something nice for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday.</v>

10
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>How about a sexual favor for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday?</v>

11
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they didn't use those words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I won't say them on camera here.</v>

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>going slow and being calm and thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

14
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>I realized that if I said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be very offensive.</v>

15
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't this lawyer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that our girls are good enough</v>

16
00:00:57.041 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was very careful to answer in a way</v>

17
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>to not offend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

18
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure the girls are lovely,</v>

19
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>but considering my circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd really rather not made it seem</v>

20
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yet very respectful.</v>

21
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>And actually many hours later I had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite problem because they were</v>

22
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>smoking marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were in a good mood and I'm</v>

23
00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 1>blindfolded with my own scarf covering</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of my face and one of the men said,</v>

24
00:01:24.821 --> 00:01:25.654
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

25
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley,</v>

26
00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think these girls are starting to like</v>

27
00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at your lips.</v>

28
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 1>And that gave me the opposite problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if we went down that path and</v>

29
00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their girlfriends liked me,</v>

30
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.650
<v Speaker 1>they could get angry at me for the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that their girlfriends like me.</v>

31
00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.850
<v Speaker 1>So I had to deflect it in the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 1>And I and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in that instance I used humor,</v>

33
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>which I think you have to use very</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully in these situations,</v>

34
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>but humor is another thing in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal of,</v>

35
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>of a hostage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only to be used sparingly and with</v>

36
00:02:01.661 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>great care.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

37
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:07.420
<v Speaker 1>really the only reason these girls like</v>
<v Speaker 1>me is because most of my faces covered.</v>

38
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 1>And they thought that was hysterical and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they burst out laughing.</v>

39
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.121
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is,</v>

40
00:02:13.121 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>if you use humor the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can twist against you.</v>

41
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a point at which they,</v>

42
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are high on weed.</v>

43
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>They've had sex with the girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the second time around.</v>

44
00:02:23.711 --> 00:02:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I was there for 25 hours and and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

45
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:30.640
<v Speaker 1>one of them started imitating a Jamaican</v>
<v Speaker 1>accent.</v>

46
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very good at doing all sorts of</v>

47
00:02:32.711 --> 00:02:37.711
<v Speaker 1>different accents and I pondered very</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully whether to go with it and go</v>

48
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>where they were and I made a decision to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it so I imitated my Jamaican accent</v>

49
00:02:43.931 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 1>for them and they loved that.</v>

50
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was hysterical to them.</v>

51
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 1>The thought that this polished pressed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Caucasian attorney could be imitating a</v>

52
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Jamaican accent was was hysterical to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

53
00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>but then they were talking about a store</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was owned by Indians and I thought,</v>

54
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I do another kind of accent just</v>

55
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>to have some fun and keep things light?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

56
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:07.130
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me stop because I didn't know it and</v>

57
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as I was doing an accident that</v>

58
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>they were doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

59
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's far enough,</v>

60
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>but don't take it any further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't know when they might</v>

61
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>twist against you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think survival skills stay very</v>

62
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

63
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>observe,</v>

64
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.850
<v Speaker 1>understand your circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

65
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>give up your ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give up who you are.</v>

66
00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>I was a federal prosecutor in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

67
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>I had considerable power in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>position that I was in.</v>

68
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>I had no power at all except the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my wits,</v>

69
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>which I tried to get by with a but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

70
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.550
<v Speaker 1>but understand that you're no longer who</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are.</v>

71
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the situation and adjust to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another principle I would say</v>

72
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>for survival is to be very flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

73
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>getting the car guns pointed at me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>if I was inflexible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might've started,</v>

75
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yelling,</v>

76
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>all the detectives I spoke to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

78
00:04:06.941 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you can't second guess yourself Stanley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you managed to survive.</v>

79
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.660
<v Speaker 1>And I think because I was flexible I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to go with the situation that</v>

80
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>helped me a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And another thing you need to do is feel</v>

81
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:22.080
<v Speaker 1>some sense of empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

82
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.730
<v Speaker 1>let's look at my thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much control that I have.</v>

83
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I had seven people with automatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons on me who could have killed me</v>

84
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>at any moment and who might have killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>me at any moment.</v>

85
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.270
<v Speaker 1>And I have no doubt in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor does the Myp dea or the FBI,</v>

86
00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>that they were perfectly capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

87
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Yet there were certain things where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt I needed to keep control.</v>

88
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.890
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I first went in,</v>

89
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Speaker 1>they invited me to take off my shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said they put me down in a mattress.</v>

90
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>They took off my trench coat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept my sport jacket on,</v>

91
00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but they invited me to take off my</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes.</v>

92
00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.520
<v Speaker 1>And you know what I thought in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought a guy with his shoes off isn't</v>

93
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>walking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very powerful symbolism.</v>

94
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no thanks.</v>

95
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave them on because in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think in the psychology of the</v>

96
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man with his shoes on could walk out,</v>

97
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.510
<v Speaker 1>a man with his shoes off might not get</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance to walk out.</v>

98
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Or for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.300
<v Speaker 1>there was the point in time I purposely</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't ask to go to the bathroom.</v>

100
00:05:28.301 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to ask for anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't offered to me.</v>

101
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.520
<v Speaker 1>But they eventually asked me if I needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the bathroom.</v>

102
00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>I said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as I said just,</v>

103
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>they jumped up and sort of military</v>
<v Speaker 1>alert cocking the guns,</v>

104
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>pointing them at me and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were nervous that on the way to the</v>

105
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>bathroom I might pull something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

106
00:05:45.071 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>there I felt the need to maintain some</v>
<v Speaker 1>control even though they've got the guns</v>

107
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in control still.</v>

108
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.530
<v Speaker 1>I wanted some small bit and I stopped</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

109
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.311
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

110
00:05:54.311 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even get up.</v>

111
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

112
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>hang on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>

113
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I'm going to do is go to the</v>

114
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.500
<v Speaker 1>bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they calm down.</v>

115
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>And then we went to the bathroom and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't get shot.</v>

116
00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Another example of maintaining some</v>
<v Speaker 1>control was when I first got in there,</v>

117
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>they kept calling me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stephen</v>

118
00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and I kept saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Steven Stanley.</v>

119
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.210
<v Speaker 1>They thought this was really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

120
00:06:22.211 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanley Stevens,</v>

121
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.640
<v Speaker 1>the guy we did this to the other night</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turns out later they had actually</v>

122
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.510
<v Speaker 1>taken him to the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that the apartment gotten his money</v>

123
00:06:31.511 --> 00:06:35.350
<v Speaker 1>and then and then and then left him in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the backseat of his own car.</v>

124
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 1>I felt that it was very important not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be called Steven.</v>

125
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.030
<v Speaker 1>I felt that it was important to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>called by my correct name.</v>

126
00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.290
<v Speaker 1>My name is Stanley because my identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>was my life.</v>

127
00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.000
<v Speaker 1>If I'm a real person with a real name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're less likely to kill me.</v>

128
00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I maintained that bit of control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's also to feel a sense</v>

129
00:07:01.481 --> 00:07:03.010
<v Speaker 1>of some empowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you.</v>

130
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:06.250
<v Speaker 1>If you read the studies of posttraumatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress disorder,</v>

131
00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.520
<v Speaker 1>what they say is that people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder because</v>

132
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:15.280
<v Speaker 1>they felt the complete disempowerment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They felt the complete lack of control.</v>

133
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I was in a situation that was out of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>control for the most part,</v>

134
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:23.281
<v Speaker 1>but where I could find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used it and also I gathered clues the</v>

135
00:07:24.731 --> 00:07:26.860
<v Speaker 1>whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that to me,</v>

136
00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:31.861
<v Speaker 1>although purely psychological was a form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of control for me to have.</v>

137
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think all those things helped me</v>

138
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 2>survive.</v>
