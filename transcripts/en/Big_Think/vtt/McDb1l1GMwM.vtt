1
00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are elements of the game</v>

2
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>that you should teach in terms of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching because what poker really does</v>

3
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 1>is teach you how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>probabilities and uncertainties.</v>

4
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's so integral to life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>with everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything we tried to do,</v>

6
00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we take this route or that route?</v>

7
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>Should I go here on vacation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they're,</v>

8
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>it's all about dealing with w with</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncertainties and probabilities of</v>

9
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:34.730
<v Speaker 1>things happening and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and poker is a very fun and easy way to</v>

10
00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>teach someone how to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>it's a shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People often put poker in the same</v>

12
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.130
<v Speaker 1>ballpark as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as just general gambling.</v>

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because some people choose to play</v>

14
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>it for money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to play it for money.</v>

15
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>It's just about about winning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can win anything.</v>

16
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>He can win prizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can win match six or money.</v>

17
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that there are so many like core</v>

18
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>fundamentals of the game that I wish I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no age,</v>

19
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>age 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The these idea that these sort of ways</v>

20
00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:12.320
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected value and um,</v>

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>what probabilistic thinking in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have sped up a lot of things</v>

22
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>in my life had I been more aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also learning how to evaluate</v>

23
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:22.790
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>that's something that is not taught in</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

25
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Very rarely taught in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learning how to change our minds,</v>

26
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>update our beliefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>when we get new information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to wait is that inflammation</v>

29
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:37.940
<v Speaker 1>or reliable or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And playing poker has taught me how to</v>

30
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>do those much more accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>so if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

32
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>if there's a way to teach children's for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a game and children love to learn</v>

33
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>through games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poker could be that one of those</v>

34
00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:50.174
<v Speaker 1>methods.</v>

35
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I think something like being</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematically minded is,</v>

36
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

37
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>there's probably some aptitude involved</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

38
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I still think it's,</v>

39
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of it is down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>determination and practice.</v>

40
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take someone,</v>

41
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can just understand the concept</v>

42
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>of numbers in the first place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think the vast majority of</v>

43
00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>humans can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you can train someone to be more</v>

44
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>mathematically capable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like learning a language.</v>

45
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:23.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start off,</v>

46
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.900
<v Speaker 1>as long as you have that initial passion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and desire to get better,</v>

47
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>then there's those little incremental</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumps.</v>

48
00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 1>And it makes me so sad when I meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are like,</v>

49
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm no good at math and I'm good at</v>

50
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you actually keep asking them why</v>

51
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and go back in their history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it almost always comes down to some bad</v>

52
00:02:40.761 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>experience they had when they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably seven years old.</v>

53
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And the teacher asked them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 1>what's five times five?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they screwed up and their friends</v>

55
00:02:47.961 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 1>laughed at them and then they just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>these barriers get built and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

57
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not my thing.</v>

58
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's just a huge tragedy</v>

59
00:02:57.111 --> 00:03:02.111
<v Speaker 1>because most humans can learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be at least competent at,</v>

60
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>at basic mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the mathematics in involved</v>

61
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>in poker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not that complicated.</v>

62
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of approximations you can</v>

63
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:12.720
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

64
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>I found that I used to actually not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good at mental arithmetic.</v>

65
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine if I had a pen and paper and</v>

66
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Algebra that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked that,</v>

67
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>but in the moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men's,</v>

68
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>mental arithmetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never do.</v>

69
00:03:24.551 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>But I started playing poker inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>just practicing these things.</v>

70
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And now I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a skill I'm proud of.</v>

71
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

72
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:37.510
<v Speaker 1>it's just a willingness to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep plugging away at it.</v>
