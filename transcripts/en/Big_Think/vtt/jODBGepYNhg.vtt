1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example and I don't</v>

3
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:14.620
<v Speaker 1>really have the numbers memorized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can get the gist.</v>

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.030
<v Speaker 1>There is an example of pretty common</v>
<v Speaker 1>example that's used that you have a</v>

5
00:00:19.031 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>sister that's 22 twin sisters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're both 25 years old.</v>

6
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>One sister at 25 saved $2,000 a year for</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years until she's 35.</v>

7
00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she stops at 35 and she just</v>

8
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:36.391
<v Speaker 1>lets that $20,000 grow until she's 65.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile her twin sister did not save</v>

9
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 1>that whole 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She starts when she's 35 years old at</v>

10
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.001
<v Speaker 1>the time when her other sister quit</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving and she saves $2,000 a year for</v>

11
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>the next 30 years until she's 65 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

12
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>which she saved a total of $60,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who ends up with more money?</v>

13
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>Sr One who only saved $20,000 compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to her sister who saved for 30 years a</v>

14
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>total of $60,000 and fact sr one who</v>
<v Speaker 1>again only say for 10 years almost has</v>

15
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>double the amount of money of the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister who saved more but waited longer.</v>

16
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waited 10 years before she started</v>

17
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:23.920
<v Speaker 1>saving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the power of compound growth.</v>
