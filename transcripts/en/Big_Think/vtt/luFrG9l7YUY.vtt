1
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:02.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.110
<v Speaker 2>first off just money and where you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to pay teachers' salaries so that</v>

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 2>low income districts are able to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>adequate education,</v>

4
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 2>a more financial support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 2>for uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for college I did a comparison in</v>

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 2>conscience of a liberal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

7
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 2>with France and we know everybody knows</v>
<v Speaker 2>French do have real problems,</v>

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 2>but everybody knows that young French</v>
<v Speaker 2>are much less likely to be working than</v>

9
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 2>young Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of that is actually because the</v>

10
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 2>French do things better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Students are much less likely to be</v>

11
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 2>forced to drop out of school for</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial reasons because there are good</v>

12
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 2>government stipends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 2>students from lower income families are</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to be full time students,</v>

14
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 2>whereas in the United States they</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually have to work their way through</v>

15
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is all good stuff.</v>

16
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>There is a striking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a statistical comparison I put in the</v>

17
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:09.051
<v Speaker 2>book that if you look at bright students</v>
<v Speaker 2>as measured by tests they took in the</v>

18
00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:14.931
<v Speaker 2>eighth grade from low income families,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually less likely to get</v>

19
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 2>through college.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then really not very bright bottom</v>

20
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 2>cortel students from high income</v>
<v Speaker 2>families.</v>

21
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are a society in which the starting</v>

22
00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 2>in the wrong class makes it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to get through college and</v>

23
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.270
<v Speaker 2>that should not be the case.</v>
