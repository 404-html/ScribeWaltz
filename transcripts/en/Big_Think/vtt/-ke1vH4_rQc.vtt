1
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>If you look at our current technological</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems near our minds are they are very</v>

2
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the biggest questions for me</v>

3
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>is what's the difference between where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now and where we need to be.</v>

4
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>If you want to build mines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to build systems that are</v>

5
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 1>generally intelligent and self motivated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe self aware.</v>

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>And of course the answer to this we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know because if you knew we</v>

7
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>already done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>there are basically several perspectives</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this.</v>

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>One is our minds as general learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are able to waddle</v>

10
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary things including themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they are this,</v>

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>they probably need a very distinct set</v>
<v Speaker 1>of motivations,</v>

12
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>things that they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that humans get their</v>

14
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>specifics due to their particular needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have cognitive and social and</v>

15
00:00:51.481 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>physiological needs and they turn us on</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are.</v>

16
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Our motivations determine what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we put our attention to and what</v>

17
00:00:58.021 --> 00:00:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you learned and what we actually do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>But you model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about we perceive what are your</v>

19
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>conscious of in a similar sense it might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that it's sufficient to build a</v>

20
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>genuine learning architecture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>combined this is a good motivational</v>

21
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>system in beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not there yet that we have built a</v>

22
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>genuine learning architecture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

23
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>our minds can learn and create new</v>
<v Speaker 1>algorithms.</v>

24
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:21.330
<v Speaker 1>They can be used to write code and</v>
<v Speaker 1>invent code programming code for</v>

25
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the rules that you need to build the</v>

26
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>shop and ran their chop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were a shopkeeper,</v>

27
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>which is some kind of programming task</v>
<v Speaker 1>in its own right.</v>

28
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to build a system that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is able to do this yet.</v>

29
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It involves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

30
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>that we have systems that are able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn loops and you have some techniques</v>

31
00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>

32
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long short term memory and a few other</v>

33
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are nowhere near of what people</v>

34
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>can do so far and it's not quite clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much work needs to be done to extend</v>

35
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>these systems into what people can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that it's very simple.</v>

36
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>It could be that it's going to take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of research,</v>

37
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>the dire view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was more the traditional view</v>

38
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>is that human minds have a lot of also</v>
<v Speaker 1>going our complexity that you need to</v>

39
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:06.501
<v Speaker 1>build a lot of functionality into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Minsky Society of mind to get to</v>

40
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>all the tricks that people are up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that is the case then it might</v>

41
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>take a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to do,</v>

42
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we created all these different financial</v>

43
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that it's going to be</v>

44
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>so dire because our genome is very short</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of that codes for the single</v>

45
00:02:22.021 --> 00:02:24.300
<v Speaker 1>cell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very little of it codes for the brain.</v>

46
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>And I think a sale is much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than a brain.</v>

47
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>A brain is probably largely self</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizing and build,</v>

48
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>not like clockwork,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like a couple of Chino.</v>

49
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>So you'll mix the right ingredients and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you let it percolate and then forms</v>

50
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:40.230
<v Speaker 1>a particular kind of structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do think because nature of pulls it</v>

51
00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>off pretty well in most of the cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

52
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though brain probably needs more</v>

53
00:02:45.871 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>complexity than a Cappuccino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically more,</v>

54
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.650
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be much simpler than</v>
<v Speaker 1>building a very complicated machine like</v>

55
00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>a cell.</v>
