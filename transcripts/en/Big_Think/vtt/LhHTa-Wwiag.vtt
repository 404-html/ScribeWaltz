1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.540
<v Speaker 2>sick one hero I would mention</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Galileo and the reason,</v>

3
00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>the reason for that and the reason I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 2>at least to my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 2>he's the greatest scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it the way we do science now is to</v>

6
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:32.501
<v Speaker 2>actually have ideas that we can test</v>
<v Speaker 2>with experiments and it's this,</v>

7
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>it's called the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So critical to making science more than</v>

8
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think in earlier civilizations,</v>

9
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>the Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Romans,</v>

10
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Speaker 2>the greatest minds of philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.120
<v Speaker 2>like just sort of intuitive things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

12
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 2>here's the way things must be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 2>and of course that's a recipe for making</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of mistakes and for having a,</v>

14
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 2>a false impression of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what Galileo did was to say,</v>

15
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.010
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an idea,</v>

16
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:14.360
<v Speaker 2>but I think the way to go is to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiments and,</v>

17
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to test the ideas.</v>

18
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:21.011
<v Speaker 2>And that I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the bedrock upon which a modern</v>

19
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>science is built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also.</v>

20
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

21
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>he took a lot of heat for what he did in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lifetime,</v>

22
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Catholic Church and uh,</v>

23
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 2>and he was operating under a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme circumstances.</v>

24
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 2>And given those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you performed pretty darn well.</v>
