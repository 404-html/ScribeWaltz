00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book is not played out,</v>

2
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>the idea of what a book can be is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>played out in its form as it is with</v>

3
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>paper and covers and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are things that can be,</v>

4
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>that digital will never touch and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I wanted to do with</v>

5
00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>this and comparing it to a cassette</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape,</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.430
<v Speaker 1>the old fashioned way of making a mix</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape,</v>

7
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:30.264
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>I love burning cds too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something far more</v>

9
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>passionate and hands on and hard work</v>
<v Speaker 1>about making a mix tape on a cassette.</v>

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.370
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too easy to revise with a CD and</v>

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 1>today's technology makes it too easy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

12
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>to change immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you can cover your mistakes quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

14
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:53.911
<v Speaker 1>th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

15
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it allows you to have the sheen</v>

16
00:00:56.641 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>of perfection around yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 1>and with a old fashioned book or an old</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashioned cassette tape,</v>

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see all the flaws and</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfections and the bad choices.</v>

19
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's something we lose</v>

20
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>with technology when you talk about bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices</v>

21
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>like costs $300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>

22
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything that costs $300</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be called egalitarian.</v>

23
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of the world can afford a $300</v>

24
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>reading device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a one percent of one percent of one</v>

25
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>percent that automatically qualifies for</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically elite status.</v>

26
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.340
<v Speaker 1>But what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really going on here,</v>

27
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the reading public doesn't really know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all they're concerned about and</v>

28
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:43.590
<v Speaker 1>all their defending is they're reading</v>
<v Speaker 1>convenience,</v>

29
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.400
<v Speaker 1>which I completely understand whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of physical disability or</v>

30
00:01:47.401 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>because of personal preference or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newness of it,</v>

31
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.880
<v Speaker 1>why they love a digital book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't understand the economic</v>

32
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>corporate pressures going on in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing world and what's going to</v>

33
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is going to happen on the</v>

34
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Internet to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>we liked to pretend that the internet is</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

36
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.021
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>we like to pretend it's an opensource</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

38
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>But as culture changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as corporate,</v>

39
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 1>old corporate models of distributing</v>
<v Speaker 1>information are changing,</v>

40
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people assume that</v>

41
00:02:14.641 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>corporations aren't going to take over</v>
<v Speaker 1>this medium as well because they can.</v>

42
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:19.771
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

43
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening in the book world</v>
<v Speaker 1>digital books is that these ebook</v>

45
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barnes and noble,</v>

47
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>others that are rising a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't seek to publish books.</v>

48
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.710
<v Speaker 1>They're going to end up seeking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>books to be chosen to be published.</v>

49
00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>this economic model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's set up now is going to</v>

51
00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:47.361
<v Speaker 1>favor a certain kind of book a and</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishers and being economically</v>

52
00:02:49.171 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>motivated companies are only going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing those kinds of books and the</v>

53
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:58.761
<v Speaker 1>divide between pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop writing and literary writing.</v>

54
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Is this going to increase and increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>and increase?</v>

55
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to make it harder and</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder and harder for first time writers</v>

56
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>to get published in any form whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they'll get attention,</v>

57
00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.940
<v Speaker 1>who can find you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.410
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to find anybody.</v>

59
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's really arisen out of the</v>

60
00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Internet to become a major voice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.740
<v Speaker 1>they always end up getting a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>published and then the book makes them a</v>

62
00:03:24.741 --> 00:03:27.320
<v Speaker 1>major voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody has.</v>

63
00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Internet averse at all.</v>

66
00:03:31.911 --> 00:03:33.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:33.261 --> 00:03:35.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is,</v>

68
00:03:35.461 --> 00:03:37.460
<v Speaker 1>is that it's a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>

69
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.660
<v Speaker 1>unfiltered library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

70
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.630
<v Speaker 1>which has the strength and beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's impossible to find people.</v>

71
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.430
<v Speaker 1>And you what we ended up doing anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to about five sites,</v>

72
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.540
<v Speaker 1>and I think most people probably do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

74
00:03:53.541 --> 00:03:58.380
<v Speaker 1>You create this little small town inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and we end up in all of</v>

75
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:00.560
<v Speaker 1>these little tiny separate communities.</v>

76
00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan Jett and interview with Joan Jett,</v>

77
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:06.530
<v Speaker 1>she said about the music industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said the thing that's missing now is</v>

78
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.740
<v Speaker 1>anticipation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see said that nobody gets in a big</v>

79
00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:13.190
<v Speaker 1>line outside of tower records anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for that new stones album to</v>

80
00:04:13.191 --> 00:04:16.430
<v Speaker 1>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody stands in line outside or a</v>

81
00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.250
<v Speaker 1>record store waiting to buy the tickets</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the WHO concert.</v>

82
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real lack of community on the,</v>

83
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.381
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:23.381 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>in the Internet experience when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to art and you can't tell me and it's</v>

85
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>not true that communicating strictly</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the Internet forums community</v>

86
00:04:32.091 --> 00:04:37.091
<v Speaker 1>and the way that being together does a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're missing all but one sense.</v>

87
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't smell people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really hear him,</v>

88
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you don't see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>and we're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're creatures of senses and the</v>

90
00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:48.050
<v Speaker 1>Internet deprives you of many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

91
00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.913
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.840
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's new art coming based on</v>

94
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>this technology and some of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and it's exciting and</v>

95
00:04:56.121 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing wrong with the old</v>

96
00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:02.570
<v Speaker 1>art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always worry and you see it with</v>

97
00:05:02.571 --> 00:05:05.060
<v Speaker 1>certain Internet folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way in which they're completely</v>

98
00:05:05.061 --> 00:05:09.380
<v Speaker 1>willing to jettison their past and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of something new.</v>

99
00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I'm worried about.</v>
