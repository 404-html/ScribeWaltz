1
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Modest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one thing we've learned over the</v>

2
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:12.914
<v Speaker 1>last eight,</v>

3
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>the obvious one is you can't bring</v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy at the barrel of a gun.</v>

4
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think people would have known</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in the first place that even the</v>

5
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 2>Bush people don't say that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

6
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 2>that's what they sought to do though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's sure it looks like that's what they</v>

7
00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 2>sought to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The point is what can you do?</v>

8
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.800
<v Speaker 2>What can any outside act or including</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States do to try to bring</v>

9
00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 2>more democratic outcomes in countries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think there's,</v>

10
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tend to talk about it as a kind of</v>

11
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 2>high thing in a low thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The low thing which happens with nobody</v>

12
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 2>particularly noticing it is the slow</v>
<v Speaker 2>effort at building up institutions.</v>

13
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 2>The state building part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

14
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.570
<v Speaker 2>and this is a key aspect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a,</v>

15
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.571
<v Speaker 2>a very gradual listic one where you try</v>
<v Speaker 2>to help countries with issues of rule of</v>

16
00:00:56.111 --> 00:01:00.130
<v Speaker 2>law and transparency and limiting</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption as well as helping to build</v>

17
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure and so forth.</v>

18
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 2>That's the low thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high thing and the dramatic thing.</v>

19
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are public diplomatic acts.</v>

20
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 2>So how can the United States make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference there?</v>

21
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some times when elections are</v>

22
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 2>enormously consequential and it really</v>
<v Speaker 2>matters a lot for the United States to</v>

23
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 2>come down on the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.570
<v Speaker 2>we saw recently in Pakistan and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States was on the wrong side and</v>

25
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>the democratic civilian secular parties</v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeded anyway.</v>

26
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 2>So it shows the limits of our power for</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad as well as for good.</v>

27
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 2>But there are moments when are these</v>
<v Speaker 2>enormously important for the United</v>

28
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 2>States to say there was a democratic</v>
<v Speaker 2>side and there is a not democratic side,</v>

29
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less democratic.</v>

30
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.680
<v Speaker 1>And we stand with the devil</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take eight an example,</v>

31
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:52.420
<v Speaker 1>which I think is not the space you hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

32
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Middle East we have a tradition</v>

33
00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:56.620
<v Speaker 1>of Islamic democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it the shoe off,</v>

34
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.720
<v Speaker 2>which is to say a council of elders who</v>
<v Speaker 2>together reach a consensual conclusion.</v>

35
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not a democracy.</v>

36
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 2>That does not represent the will of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

37
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 2>And especially in a complex society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.090
<v Speaker 2>as opposed to a tribal society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

39
00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Art will not be a,</v>

40
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.250
<v Speaker 2>a useful reflection of people's will and</v>
<v Speaker 2>will not be sufficiently accountable to</v>

41
00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>them and will not be counterbalanced by</v>
<v Speaker 2>other powers as well.</v>

42
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.070
<v Speaker 2>So there's an example where I would say</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local customs don't get you there,</v>

43
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:31.610
<v Speaker 2>or the lawyer Jirga in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very important transitional</v>

44
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 2>devices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're not the thing itself.</v>

45
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of elements of things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how power is divided between the</v>

47
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 2>center and the locality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the United States has a particular</v>

48
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>way of doing it that's very different</v>
<v Speaker 2>from our western other Western</v>

49
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 2>democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much less in other African countries.</v>

50
00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.620
<v Speaker 2>They are systems of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of adjudicating a more traditional</v>

51
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:55.431
<v Speaker 2>systems of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

52
00:02:55.431 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of justice,</v>

53
00:02:56.361 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which can waive alongside more western</v>

54
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:02.690
<v Speaker 2>systems of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So incredibly,</v>

55
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>there is not a one size fits all aspect</v>
<v Speaker 2>of democracy,</v>

56
00:03:06.431 --> 00:03:11.431
<v Speaker 2>but it's a big mistake to think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so variable that there are not a</v>

57
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>series of quite fundamental practices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>values institutions,</v>

58
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.490
<v Speaker 2>which aren't as essential for anybody.</v>
