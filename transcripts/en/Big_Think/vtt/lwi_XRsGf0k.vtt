1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>We learned from a very early age to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sense of self worth conditional upon</v>

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>some kind of external criteria which can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be judged by others because of this,</v>

3
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>self compassionate becomes a challenge</v>
<v Speaker 1>because self compassion requires a</v>

4
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:22.251
<v Speaker 1>natural ability on your part to be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deal with your failures as well as</v>

5
00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>success with understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceptance and kindness.</v>

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>The problem that I see with the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem movement particularly is that</v>

7
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>self esteem movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of plays into this tendency to make</v>

9
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.100
<v Speaker 1>your sense of worth conditional upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you achieve.</v>

10
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inevitably that involves comparison</v>

12
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

13
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also a moral problem there</v>

14
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>because in order to boost yourself as</v>
<v Speaker 1>team,</v>

15
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you need to put down in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind the self compassion doesn't require</v>

16
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What self compassion is suggesting is</v>

17
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 1>that you should be able to do the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you normally do to someone</v>

18
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>that you can towards yourself.</v>

19
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>And the beauty of that is that once you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have that kind of ability to relate to</v>

20
00:01:13.141 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>your own situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with kindness,</v>

21
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>it creates a kind of a reservoir of</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and resilience so that you have</v>

22
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>planted to draw from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise,</v>

23
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:29.121
<v Speaker 1>if your compassion has always other</v>
<v Speaker 1>directed and you do not take care of</v>

24
00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>your own needs and your own wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at some point,</v>

25
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>this kind of leads to compassion</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatigue.</v>

26
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>And even in some cases when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship does not work and when</v>

27
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>there is not enough recognition from</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from the other,</v>

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the recipient side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might even feel betrayed and let</v>

29
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:52.080
<v Speaker 1>down and used and ultimately even</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling bitterness.</v>

30
00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So having a greater base of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>compassion really buffers against all of</v>

31
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:03.891
<v Speaker 1>these potentially negative consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being always too much other focused.</v>
