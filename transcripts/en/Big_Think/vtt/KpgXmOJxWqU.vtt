1
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very fun.</v>

2
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like terminator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terminator.</v>

3
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just liked the scan things and then</v>

4
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:16.220
<v Speaker 1>something or wonder woman in a bionic</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>

5
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something attracts the attention and</v>

6
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I zero in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's funny because it can be</v>

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>millions of objects and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>so at that point it's almost irrational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What attracts me about that object?</v>

9
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>But usually there's something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:32.360
<v Speaker 1>I go in and dig deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>so it's not a first impression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not superficial.</v>

12
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 1>It's almost as if the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>

13
00:00:36.671 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>Sorry if I sound a little new agey here</v>
<v Speaker 1>at animistic,</v>

14
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>but it really works that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.470
<v Speaker 1>what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spend my day without thinking scanning</v>

16
00:00:46.471 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>things and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

17
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>I already noticed your shirt and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>already noticed,</v>

18
00:00:51.091 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I already noticed everything about you</v>

19
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>without even thinking it could be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>detective perhaps,</v>

20
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:58.281 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>and what attracts me in an object is</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of communication that the</v>

23
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>designer already instilled in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>object.</v>

24
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.933
<v Speaker 1>Because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

25
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 1>if you notice today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objects that are considered most</v>

26
00:01:09.241 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>interesting are the ones that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt by the designer with some sort of</v>

27
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I say,</v>

28
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>some sort of grabbing a element that</v>
<v Speaker 1>attracts more than your attention,</v>

29
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attracts really your interest.</v>

30
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>And this happens with all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>

31
00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I was doing an interview once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was interviewing Johnny Ive,</v>

33
00:01:30.661 --> 00:01:35.130
<v Speaker 1>who's the head designer for apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hardly ever gives interviews and I</v>

34
00:01:35.131 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 1>was really lucky that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>we're friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

36
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I convinced him to give an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we started talking about this,</v>

37
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 1>about the communication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.070
<v Speaker 1>that objects have with people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because to me one of the most stunning</v>

39
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>features of apple computers is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>little breathing light.</v>

40
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the little breathing light that tells</v>

41
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you that the computer is leaping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is asleep and not turned off.</v>

42
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's amazing.</v>

43
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think that the computer has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a heart,</v>

44
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this little touches that people</v>

45
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>noticed subliminally that differentiate</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain objects from others.</v>
