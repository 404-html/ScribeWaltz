1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So every profession has a code of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethics.</v>

2
00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Doctors have a code of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hippocratic oath,</v>

3
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountants,</v>

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:12.564
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of a profession is that there is a </v>

6
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:15.294
<v Speaker 1>code of ethics and museums and museum </v>
<v Speaker 1>directors have an association and the </v>

7
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>code and that code says among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

8
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:24.174
<v Speaker 1>that you can't sell a work of art from </v>
<v Speaker 1>your collection and use that money to </v>

9
00:00:29.761 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>use to do something else with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

10
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.653
<v Speaker 1>right now the Detroit Institute of art </v>
<v Speaker 1>is battling the city because the city </v>

11
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>wants to sell the art so that it can pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>pensions.</v>

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>How does the director defend himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does,</v>

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>how does he make a case for this not to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen?</v>

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And Who protects him along with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>board?</v>

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's where a code of ethics comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

16
00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Code of ethics that is developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked on by a group of professionals,</v>

17
00:01:01.831 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>changes over time.</v>

18
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>So now we turn to the performing arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

19
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:07.164
<v Speaker 1>it was a big surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a shock actually to hear and to </v>

20
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:11.244
<v Speaker 1>think about the fact that there really </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a code of ethics for the </v>

21
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>performing arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some research just to make sure,</v>

23
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>let me give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a mundane example,</v>

24
00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>being a former pianist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it struck me,</v>

26
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>I was at a concert and a string quartet </v>
<v Speaker 1>was playing a Schubert Quartet.</v>

28
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>And in the fourth movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first violin is turned to the second</v>

29
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:37.374
<v Speaker 1>violinist and gave a kind of a nod and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second violinist gave a kind of a </v>

30
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>nod to the cellist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get the idea.</v>

31
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>And I was thinking to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing?</v>

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.793
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they played the piece and what they </v>

33
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>did or what they didn't do was they </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't play the repeat of the first part</v>

34
00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 1>of this Schubert Quartet.</v>

35
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general audience,</v>

36
00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>they probably didn't know as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a musician,</v>

37
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:05.040
<v Speaker 1>I knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it a big deal?</v>

38
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not what Schubert intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.023
<v Speaker 1>so is there some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something that we can use to </v>

40
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>guide to help us understand what's right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's not?</v>

41
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.333
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a mundane example in lots of </v>

42
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.980
<v Speaker 1>people break that or bruits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So code of ethics about playing repeats.</v>

43
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>When I play the piano now of course I </v>
<v Speaker 1>play all the repeats that are necessary.</v>

44
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take that a little further though,</v>

45
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the realm of what does a producer </v>

46
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>do when thinking about what can be and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what can't be done.</v>

47
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years ago,</v>

48
00:02:45.121 --> 00:02:45.954
<v Speaker 1>Diane Paulus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a wonderful director and producer </v>

49
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a version of porgy and bess,</v>

50
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the classic American operas.</v>

51
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knows porgy and bess and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is sad and some of it is,</v>

52
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some people a little boring.</v>

53
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.483
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Diane Paulus decided to do a </v>

54
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:07.660
<v Speaker 1>completely different version of porgy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bess.</v>

55
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.880
<v Speaker 1>She decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 1>make it more modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine.</v>

57
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>She decided to change the ending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is questionable.</v>

58
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>She decided to change some of the music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

59
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a purist.</v>

60
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>This really bothered me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

61
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can Diane Paulus do that?</v>

62
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Of course she can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can she call it porgy and bess?</v>

63
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>It's now it played on Broadway for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>season as a cast recording.</v>

64
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.013
<v Speaker 1>And in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will there be an understanding by a </v>

65
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>generation who thinks that this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>porgy and bess is?</v>

66
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't want to be pedantic about </v>

67
00:03:49.481 --> 00:03:50.314
<v Speaker 1>this but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my point is that over and over </v>

68
00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:53.824
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are questions that every </v>

69
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 1>profession has that the members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profession have not discussed to say </v>

70
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>what's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong and argue about sure.</v>

71
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>But there's no basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no moral basis.</v>

72
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:12.490
<v Speaker 1>It gets a little more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a production in Berlin,</v>

73
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:17.491
<v Speaker 1>in Berlin Opera House of a Mozart opera </v>
<v Speaker 1>called in dominium and this producer,</v>

74
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>opera director in Berlin and in Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>they do kind of outlandish kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opera,</v>

76
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.050
<v Speaker 1>decided to do a very outlandish </v>
<v Speaker 1>production in which among other things,</v>

77
00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.590
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed was inserted into the opera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't in the opera and uh,</v>

78
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>took the place of another character.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for some people,</v>

79
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>for some Muslims it seemed like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sacrilegious thing to do and there was a</v>

80
00:04:47.261 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>big protest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

81
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.063
<v Speaker 1>does the head of the opera company say </v>
<v Speaker 1>the director has the right and the </v>

82
00:04:57.281 --> 00:04:58.114
<v Speaker 1>ethical right to do what he thinks is </v>
<v Speaker 1>right or does that person give into </v>

83
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.610
<v Speaker 1>public appeal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the answer is who knows?</v>

84
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.663
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is also we don't know </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there isn't this kind of set </v>

85
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:14.104
<v Speaker 1>rule.</v>

86
00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>If a doctor is faced with an ethical </v>
<v Speaker 1>choice,</v>

87
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.753
<v Speaker 1>they turned to their code of ethics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a museum director is faced with an </v>

88
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>ethical choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn to a code of ethics.</v>

89
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.483
<v Speaker 1>If a performing arts director or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>string quartet leader or a producer on </v>

90
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:37.741
<v Speaker 1>Broadway is faced with what might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered by some an ethical choice,</v>

91
00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>they have nothing to fall back on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

92
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>What we need are a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals who are in the theater who</v>

93
00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:47.194
<v Speaker 1>can at least discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can set the beginnings of a </v>

94
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 1>fundamental of unethical decision or </v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical philosophy.</v>
