00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Today</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to overcome American</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance in the world,</v>

3
00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>are trying to overcome the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>

4
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying that's taking place here and</v>

5
00:00:28.671 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>there in the world in Iraq and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan and,</v>

6
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military bases in 100 countries.</v>

7
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think people are trying to work</v>
<v Speaker 1>their way towards a more democratic</v>

8
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.281
<v Speaker 1>society wherever possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to do it without war.</v>

9
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this movement towards a more</v>

10
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>democratic society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>society is more concerned with human</v>

11
00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

12
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Speaker 1>we've already seen it begin to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America with movements from</v>

13
00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 1>autocratic and elitist states to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>populous states.</v>

14
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.440
<v Speaker 1>And it may be that the European Union</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents this in some way.</v>

15
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a longterm process.</v>

17
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>what is going on is an attempt to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world which is different than the</v>

19
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>world of the past hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a world of an incessant war</v>

20
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>and domination of the world by</v>
<v Speaker 1>superpowers.</v>

21
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>First two superpowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now one superpower.</v>
