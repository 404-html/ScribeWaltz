1
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:06.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is,</v>

2
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>has a wonderfully rich artistic legacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>it's predominantly European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>even though it's unfashionable to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>but it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mix of European cultures that doesn't</v>

6
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>happen in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then by the time they got to the</v>

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:24.150
<v Speaker 1>west coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were suddenly being hit with,</v>

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>with native American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>with Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Latin American and oceanic</v>

10
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>traditions too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the American arts are in a funny</v>

11
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meeting place,</v>

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of world culture onto which are the kind</v>

13
00:00:40.231 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>of a European DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything else has been grafted.</v>

14
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Perfect example of this is jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>which takes this s four square European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>kind of music and then begins to</v>
<v Speaker 1>syncopate it to African poly rhythms.</v>

17
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:54.870
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

18
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>and if you look at the way that the AF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the African arts largely as they came</v>

20
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.710
<v Speaker 1>through the Caribbean and through</v>
<v Speaker 1>American slave culture,</v>

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>completely transformed with the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>European arts are,</v>

22
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we are here as a</v>

23
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>meeting place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of laboratory of,</v>

24
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:10.500
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human existence.</v>

25
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a really interesting thing,</v>

26
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>and I've really never heard anybody say</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

27
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the last hundred years of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arts,</v>

28
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>there has never been a place it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of human history that has had as</v>

29
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>much happen as the United States has</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the last hundred years.</v>

30
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And it's ranged from classical music to</v>
<v Speaker 1>jazz,</v>

31
00:01:31.741 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>to rock and roll to hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from abstract expressionist painting to</v>

32
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to comic books.</v>

33
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:39.571
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:39.571 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>to a newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cartooning,</v>

36
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novels,</v>

37
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama,</v>

38
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

39
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't even begun to exhaust the</v>

40
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:48.501
<v Speaker 1>arts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:53.501
<v Speaker 1>just in music loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do believe that in some funny way,</v>

42
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Speaker 1>this unbelievable diversity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression has come out of the fact that</v>

43
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>we were the first big society in</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

44
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which let the individual be free to</v>

45
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>pursue with the individual wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's good not to have a</v>

46
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>cultural policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people should create their own art</v>

47
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.110
<v Speaker 1>in that ways that they want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

48
00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of American art,</v>

49
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>even though I have often criticize</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of American culture.</v>

50
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.430
<v Speaker 1>There's something happening in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

51
00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>It's never happened before in all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>

52
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and it's exciting.</v>
