00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>The war is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>most of us have given up most of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>privacy already.</v>

3
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>If you are giving your all of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial disclosures online,</v>

4
00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.020
<v Speaker 1>your credit card,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your social security and so forth,</v>

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.880
<v Speaker 1>I think the way we protect those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>can afford us the ability to protect our</v>

6
00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:24.820
<v Speaker 1>medical records as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's moving in this direction.</v>

7
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.340
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a one would say there is almost a moral</v>

8
00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:30.820
<v Speaker 1>obligation for people to begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>disclose at least a portion of their</v>

9
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>medical records online because it's only</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that disclosure on a large</v>

10
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:36.160
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>you're not your necessarily your name</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your identity,</v>

13
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but at least you're finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're phenotypical data and your</v>

14
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:49.171
<v Speaker 1>genomic data will allow us to create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole revolution in personalized and</v>

15
00:00:49.421 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>preventative medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a,</v>

16
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>which is extraordinarily important for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next few decades.</v>

17
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 2>We are testing what it is like to lose</v>
<v Speaker 2>privacy.</v>

18
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:04.461
<v Speaker 2>Now the loss of privacy inherent in</v>
<v Speaker 2>these technologies is a precursor to an</v>

19
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 2>almost biological or extra sensory loss</v>
<v Speaker 2>of privacy that will come as the species</v>

20
00:01:11.251 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shame that could be used to control us,</v>

21
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 2>will no longer be able to control us</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we'll find out that everybody</v>

22
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 2>masturbates or everybody has this kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sex with their,</v>

23
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 2>with their spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or eat this kind of food or picks their</v>

24
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 2>nose or does whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of taboo won't be taboo anymore.</v>

25
00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is truly taboo will</v>

26
00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 2>kind of rise to the surface in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we'll see what we all can kind of</v>

27
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 2>agree that we don't want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the species survives,</v>

28
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

29
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 2>we'll develop that sort of organismic</v>
<v Speaker 2>capability and we won't be able to be</v>

30
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed by that stuff anymore.</v>
