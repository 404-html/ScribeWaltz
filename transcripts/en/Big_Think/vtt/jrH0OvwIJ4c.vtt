00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I think religious communities are</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely important as ways of</v>

3
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commitments and identities and that</v>

4
00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that continues to be the case and,</v>

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>and will continue to be the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>whether there is a rising tide of</v>
<v Speaker 1>secularism as some argue or a rising</v>

7
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:34.470
<v Speaker 1>tide of a resurgence of religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>worldwide,</v>

8
00:00:34.471 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as others argue,</v>

9
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I think depends very much on which</v>
<v Speaker 1>country we look at.</v>

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.920
<v Speaker 1>I think if we look at the broader sweep</v>
<v Speaker 1>of human history,</v>

11
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear the outlier is Europe and</v>

12
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>America in so far as it had western</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe from the enlightenment on and the</v>

13
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>United States in so far as it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>followed that pattern and it was only in</v>

14
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>perfectly and perfectly followed it for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of human history.</v>

15
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Religion has always been a dimension of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's finding,</v>

16
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>their identity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the affirming values and I think</v>

17
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>into a significant degree that is again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening worldwide.</v>

18
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most visible form of it is Islam in</v>

19
00:01:19.801 --> 00:01:24.801
<v Speaker 1>which it's clear Islam is playing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major geopolitical role that it hasn't</v>

20
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some centuries,</v>

21
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's not only Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also clear that religious,</v>

22
00:01:29.581 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>a resurgence a is evident in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities as well.</v>

23
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally am A.</v>

24
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Christian who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's Christian identity is,</v>

25
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>would be disputed by a great many</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christians.</v>

26
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I could tell you a story</v>

27
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

28
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>in 1969,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1970,</v>

29
00:01:51.901 --> 00:01:56.901
<v Speaker 1>I spent a year in Sri Lanka studying</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism and my Buddhist conversation</v>

30
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.200
<v Speaker 1>we're convinced that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what defined a Christian was that a</v>

32
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:09.201
<v Speaker 1>Christian believed in God is a being</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside the world who created the world,</v>

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And number two,</v>

34
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that a Christian believed in that every</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual what had an immortal soul.</v>

35
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>And when I told him that I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe either of those propositions,</v>

36
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but considered myself a Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

37
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible.</v>

38
00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a Christian unless you</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in a god outside the world who</v>

39
00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>created the world in an immortal soul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

40
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>now many Christians would agree those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very important for defining</v>

41
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my kind of Buddhist Christianity or</v>

42
00:02:41.131 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>Buddhist influence Christianity is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

43
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

44
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>an od,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a combination of affirmations,</v>

45
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>but one in which I feel quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and in which both some</v>

46
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Christians and some Buddhists would</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider me suspect.</v>
