00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Without even knowing the world because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have any of the other chemical</v>

2
00:00:21.831 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know how to do it.</v>

3
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>We know what sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew how to very crap so that the,</v>

4
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diminish the quality of the earth and so</v>

6
00:00:33.531 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know how to do that.</v>

7
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>We know how to use a natural fertilizer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all that.</v>

8
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that we don't know it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more work and the food is ship.</v>

9
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>The food is to ship in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was a little more expensive and</v>

10
00:00:47.541 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>people will come in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drove.</v>

11
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And apparently the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

12
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:51.494
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organic market is working 20% up</v>

14
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.550
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's been moving and incredible</v>

15
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still very expensive for</v>

16
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>certain people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time that it will be only 30 or</v>

17
00:01:05.691 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>40% more than regular product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are going to move in,</v>

18
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 1>drove,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:12.020
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to organic product.</v>

20
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.913
<v Speaker 1>And we should,</v>

21
00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>I believe so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the,</v>

22
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>even when I was at Howard Johnson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that you can,</v>

23
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can produce well,</v>

24
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>especially now with new technique of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviets and other innovation in</v>

25
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:32.050
<v Speaker 1>technology that come about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's done with the best product to</v>

26
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will cost money.</v>

27
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is great product now which come</v>

28
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>from Spain for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can product with new way of canning,</v>

29
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.460
<v Speaker 1>don't have to be retarded that is cooked</v>
<v Speaker 1>so long so that it diminish a great deal</v>

31
00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>of the taste in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is all kinds of new innovation.</v>

32
00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.250

<v Speaker 1>I absolutely believe that technically we</v>

33
00:01:51.251 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>will be able,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already able to do food which tastes</v>
