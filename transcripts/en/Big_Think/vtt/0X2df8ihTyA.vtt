1
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>it is interesting that it never started </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

3
00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>a pure business plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 20 or 30 page business plan.</v>

4
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>It really came about through </v>
<v Speaker 1>happenstance when I was taking a trip to</v>

5
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>go to whistler ski week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:23.694
<v Speaker 1>and I had booked the ticket,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the air flight on orbits and orbits did </v>

7
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>not send me any information on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>

8
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much a travel enthusiast.</v>

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I've traveled all my life having lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>or worked overseas,</v>

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

11
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.603
<v Speaker 1>on many different occasions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that it was strange that </v>

12
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>there was no information provided by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>online travel agency.</v>

13
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:43.064
<v Speaker 1>So I actually decided to get into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>business initially by publishing a </v>

14
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:52.581
<v Speaker 1>series of online travel guides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we started out by partnering with an</v>

15
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>airline America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>West Airlines with the thought of,</v>

16
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adding on additional partnerships over </v>

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eventually by stepping in a,</v>

18
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.033
<v Speaker 1>with the online guides that led to my </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring other areas of opportunity in </v>

19
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.774
<v Speaker 1>the travel industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly with travel deals </v>

20
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:10.284
<v Speaker 1>publishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really is our core business these </v>

21
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.871
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:13.704
<v Speaker 1>so we migrated from being a publisher of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure online travel guides to being one </v>

23
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>of being a rather large publisher of </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel deals today.</v>

24
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shermans travel.com</v>

25
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>is a publisher of travel deals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination advice.</v>

26
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're very different from the Ota,</v>

27
00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>the online travel agencies like Expedia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>priceline,</v>

28
00:01:34.311 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>and travelocity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Orbitz,</v>

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of those are our clients of ours,</v>

30
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are a pure publisher,</v>

31
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.874
<v Speaker 1>so we're advertising supported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We published thousands of deals and </v>

32
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:49.991
<v Speaker 1>they're handpicked by our editors every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and published on the website as well</v>

33
00:01:50.031 --> 00:01:50.864
<v Speaker 1>as through our email products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have are a Sherman's top 25 travel </v>

34
00:01:53.751 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>deals newsletter that comes out every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wednesday,</v>

35
00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is received by over 4 million </v>

36
00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>subscribers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.600
<v Speaker 1>the website has a host of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

38
00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>including over 300 travel guides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>

39
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>one-on-ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slide shows,</v>

40
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.100
<v Speaker 1>a lot of great resources there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hotel reviews,</v>

41
00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>and a travel search tool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.023
<v Speaker 1>we also publish a magazine which is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>upscale while the website is more mass </v>

44
00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>market reaching the broad audience of </v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure travelers.</v>

45
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magazine's skews more upscale and </v>

46
00:02:24.651 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>it's positioned around what we call </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart luxury.</v>

47
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>So it's a combination of luxury but </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a good value.</v>

48
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 1>And our brand positioning overall is </v>
<v Speaker 1>about value,</v>

49
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>whether it's on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.883
<v Speaker 1>on the lower end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call a smart bargain or the </v>

51
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>higher end in terms of a smart luxury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The magazine,</v>

52
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does cover some deals.</v>

53
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:46.160
<v Speaker 1>We have a section there called the Lux </v>
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>

54
00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:47.121 --> 00:02:47.954
<v Speaker 1>the best values of the season that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best and foreign five star </v>

56
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>vacations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 1>but the magazine is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 1>always looking for a deal per se.</v>

58
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>The magazine will cover destinations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>

59
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>places to stay that are upscale but </v>
<v Speaker 1>still work but are worth the money.</v>

61
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.563
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we may talk about an $800 a night </v>

62
00:03:07.271 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>resort in St Barts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time we'll highlight one</v>

63
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>that's three or $400.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's less expensive.</v>

64
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.374
<v Speaker 1>It's still luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to be a little more </v>

65
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>affordable for what we view as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant portion of the population.</v>

66
00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:22.400
<v Speaker 1>That is those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.253
<v Speaker 1>that we call the mass affluent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not necessarily the ultra rich that are </v>

68
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>willing to pay any price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may be point,</v>

69
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.380
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one percent of the population,</v>

70
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.453
<v Speaker 1>but rather a larger segment that want a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more affordable but still a luxurious </v>

71
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.683
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

72
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly anyone that is in the deals </v>

73
00:03:42.781 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>business is in a good position these </v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

74
00:03:45.151 --> 00:03:49.620
<v Speaker 1>given the recession that we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is true both on the high end in</v>

75
00:03:49.621 --> 00:03:50.454
<v Speaker 1>terms of our luxury value positioning </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the magazine as well as for the </v>

76
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:56.490
<v Speaker 1>website and our email products that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

77
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.463
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide great overall deals and </v>

78
00:03:59.431 --> 00:04:00.570
<v Speaker 1>bargains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

79
00:04:00.571 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>so we do find that a lot of suppliers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are price cutting.</v>

80
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:05.280
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt about that.</v>

81
00:04:05.281 --> 00:04:06.114
<v Speaker 1>Hotels need to do that to fill up their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms and to decrease their vacancy </v>

82
00:04:11.221 --> 00:04:12.960
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same with the airlines.</v>

83
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:14.053
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a great time as a traveler to </v>

84
00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:16.704
<v Speaker 1>find amazing deals out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately for us as a business </v>

85
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:21.533
<v Speaker 1>the suppliers and the agencies because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making less money means they </v>

87
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:28.860
<v Speaker 1>have less money to spend on advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ad budgets,</v>

88
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:29.694
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>

89
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly very tight this year,</v>

90
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:35.563
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of hotspot vacations certainly </v>

91
00:04:37.621 --> 00:04:39.120
<v Speaker 1>for American travelers.</v>

92
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Caribbean is doing incredibly well.</v>

93
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that may be because people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a little bit scared off of Mexico,</v>

94
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given uh,</v>

95
00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>the flu and then crime and some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues there.</v>

96
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 1>So I know a number of travelers have </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

97
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Plans have shifted perhaps to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean.</v>

98
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of other,</v>

99
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.703
<v Speaker 1>a hotspot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly Americans are going to any </v>

100
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.690
<v Speaker 1>value destinations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a London for example,</v>

101
00:05:03.691 --> 00:05:04.524
<v Speaker 1>visit Britain's been doing an amazing </v>
<v Speaker 1>job in promoting London as a </v>

102
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:07.764
<v Speaker 1>destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been relatively low cost to </v>

103
00:05:10.141 --> 00:05:10.974
<v Speaker 1>get to in terms of the airfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the hotels are quite affordable </v>

104
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:14.784
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of price competition </v>

105
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

106
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.780
<v Speaker 1>there are also great values in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of second tier destinations,</v>

107
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.310
<v Speaker 1>places like a Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>budapest,</v>

108
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.580
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even Luganda,</v>

109
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.423
<v Speaker 1>some other destinations in central and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Europe that are very affordable </v>

110
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 1>for travelers these days.</v>
