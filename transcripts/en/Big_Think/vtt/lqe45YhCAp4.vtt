1
00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>So Moore's laws or the law of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer industry that says compute</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>power doubles every 24 months or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 1>that sort of put out there by experts in</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology development is sort of,</v>

4
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prototype,</v>

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that it really shoot</v>

6
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>for more as law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody ever keeps up with Moore's</v>

7
00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:19.950
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's up the computer industry.</v>

8
00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So it's saying we actually track and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been tracking really,</v>

9
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past 15 years in terms of the costs</v>

10
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>for Dna sequencing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying our best to keep up with Moore's</v>

11
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:32.791
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we actually,</v>

12
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>we actually did keep up with Moore's law</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quite effectively,</v>

13
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>near the end of the genome project.</v>

14
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>And even in a number of years for about</v>
<v Speaker 1>four or five years after the genome</v>

15
00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>project using the old fashion method</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we used to use,</v>

16
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for DNA sequencing.</v>

17
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>But we had sufficiently industrialized</v>
<v Speaker 1>those methods and it actually allowed us</v>

18
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:56.940
<v Speaker 1>to keep up with Moore's law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened about 2007 our</v>

19
00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>major groups switched over to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fancy new methods.</v>

20
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 1>They're called next generation DNA</v>
<v Speaker 1>sequencing methods and almost overnight</v>

21
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.440
<v Speaker 1>and has just continued to do it up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present time.</v>

22
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>They outstrip Moore's law by far and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really been truly remarkable.</v>

23
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>They'll cost of DNA sequencing have</v>
<v Speaker 1>plummeted tremendously so that that</v>

24
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 1>first human genome sequence that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>completed 10 years ago cost $1 billion.</v>

25
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And now we can sequence a human genome</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in a matter of a day or two.</v>

26
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And it costs well under $10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really just a few thousand dollars.</v>

27
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you follow the curves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've been following,</v>

28
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>you can see particularly over the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years,</v>

29
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:38.061
<v Speaker 1>we have outpaced Moore's law by far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So among the many exciting developments</v>

30
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>in genomics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 1>really continues to be new technologies</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sequencing DNA.</v>

32
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>We've come along way and have incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful methods today,</v>

33
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's new ones coming and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to invest in the development of</v>

34
00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>new technologies because we see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of it.</v>

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a particular new methodology</v>

36
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>that's getting a lot of attention in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genomics community these days called</v>

37
00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>nanopore sequencing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is just these molecules that</v>

38
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>sit and lip ud by layers and the strands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of DNA sort of get pulled through it and</v>

39
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>literally are able to detect every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single base on that DNA ladder.</v>

40
00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>One at a time as it gets pulled through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The nanopore is just way cool.</v>

41
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 1>But what's particularly cool about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the technologies are,</v>

42
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>can be reduced to really small form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the companies that's</v>

43
00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing is releasing an instrument</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year that um,</v>

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically looks like a USB device.</v>

45
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a USB device a little bit bigger</v>

46
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:39.171
<v Speaker 1>than a thumb drive and literally it</v>
<v Speaker 1>plugs into the USB port of a laptop</v>

47
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:40.554
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

48
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it,</v>

49
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I haven't seen it operate yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm told it can sequence a human</v>

50
00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>genome and something like a day we'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to see when it's released.</v>

51
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I'll how it really performs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the notion,</v>

52
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whether it's that company,</v>

53
00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.080
<v Speaker 1>whether it's this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's another company that's</v>

54
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.070
<v Speaker 1>another year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not science fiction to believe that</v>

55
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>we will have these little USB devices</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in our laptop that can read out</v>

56
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>human genome sequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next year or two or three.</v>

57
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly cool with this first</v>

58
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>company that's launching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these USB devices is that the company</v>

60
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:19.081
<v Speaker 1>tells me that the USB device that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will sequence a human genome will work</v>

61
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>equally well in a pc or a macintosh</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer,</v>

62
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.840
<v Speaker 1>which makes me think everything.</v>
