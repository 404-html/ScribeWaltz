1
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this person does exist,</v>

2
00:00:06.551 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's really confined primarily to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposition party,</v>

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>to the supporters of the opposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

4
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we saw the same thing really,</v>

5
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Bush administration,</v>

6
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the last two years of the</v>

7
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of angry voters out</v>

8
00:00:22.631 --> 00:00:23.051
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

9
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>

10
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>they were almost all democrats who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about things like the war in Iraq,</v>

11
00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

12
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration's,</v>

13
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and environmental policies and</v>

14
00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with a Democratic president and</v>

15
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Republicans,</v>

16
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the more engaged Republicans</v>

17
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:44.920
<v Speaker 1>who are angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're angry because they disagree,</v>

18
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Democrats on issues like</v>

19
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.030
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and budgetary priorities and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

21
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:54.641
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:54.641 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>I think there are angry voters that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

23
00:00:56.471 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes it gets a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>overblown,</v>

24
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not sure that,</v>

25
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>voters are really angry or overall now</v>

26
00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.930
<v Speaker 1>than they have been in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just that we're seeing more</v>
<v Speaker 1>visible manifestations of that with</v>

28
00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>these tea party demonstrations.</v>

29
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not angry anymore because now,</v>

30
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part pick because you have</v>

31
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>a democratic president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>now they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>some of them might still not be thrilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of the things the Obama</v>

34
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>administration has done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by and large,</v>

35
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 1>I think what you find is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a reversal,</v>

36
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

37
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.940
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anger is gone over from one side to</v>

39
00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other,</v>

40
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>not right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's harder I think for people to get</v>

42
00:01:49.921 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>worked up when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>they're in the majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>that especially in midterm elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to see that it's the disgruntled</v>

45
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>people who are the most active.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw that in 2006 where it was really</v>

46
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the most enthusiastic,</v>

47
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 1>most engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.010
<v Speaker 1>and now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>with a Democrat in the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 1>so it's sort of part of the normal cycle</v>
<v Speaker 1>of American politics.</v>

52
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what tends to happen in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these midterm elections.</v>

53
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just that with increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>

54
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens now is that these</v>

55
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>swings become greater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>and the reaction becomes even stronger.</v>

57
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
