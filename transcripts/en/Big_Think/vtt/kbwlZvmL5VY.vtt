00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Is to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge is to sit there basically</v>

2
00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many times when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just want to flee.</v>

3
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not the life that I would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>

5
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more difficult in some ways.</v>

6
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>The actual act of writing is both more</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult and more rewarding.</v>

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.140
<v Speaker 1>The re you have searched states of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like ecstasy in your writing,</v>

8
00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it goes well,</v>

9
00:00:41.751 --> 00:00:45.920
<v Speaker 1>when it goes specially well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not something you can imagine</v>

10
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>when you're first starting out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It certainly wasn't what happened to me</v>

11
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>those first few times I wrote poems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 1>but then the going on with it is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard.</v>

13
00:00:56.331 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>There was a period when I renounced it</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was,</v>

14
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how old was there?</v>

15
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Right after I published my first book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life was a mess.</v>

16
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:11.801
<v Speaker 1>I was separating from my then wife and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just decided let this life of a poet is</v>

17
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Kelly.</v>

18
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>May I have to do something else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I couldn't.</v>

19
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought of writing screenplays.</v>

20
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was a director in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood and I said,</v>

21
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a director.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

22
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>that's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but try writing some screenplays.</v>

23
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>So I sat that and I started and I found</v>
<v Speaker 1>it very boring.</v>

24
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>So I just sat at my desk for a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

25
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 1>really doing nothing but keeping the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same hours I did when I was writing</v>

26
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I started writing again and I</v>

27
00:01:43.971 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>started writing in a new way and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very exciting.</v>

28
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>It was actually after my second book,</v>

29
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>it's always difficult question for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

30
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>What's next?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you never know whether you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write another poem.</v>

32
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

33
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>you have faith that you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you never know for sure.</v>

34
00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 1>You never know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the light will come with the force,</v>

35
00:02:14.861 --> 00:02:19.861
<v Speaker 1>will take it with the music will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I think maybe I should try</v>

36
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>something else now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should write the novel I never</v>

37
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>wrote or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I really have no gift for that</v>

38
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>or no patience for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hope out,</v>

39
00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>just write some pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lie.</v>
