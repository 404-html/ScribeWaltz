1
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.140
<v Speaker 1>In 1947,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong bought a tape recorder.</v>

2
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Commercial tape recorders were new at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

3
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.931
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the first people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America to buy one like everyone else,</v>

4
00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>if his generation who first got his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands on a tape recorder,</v>

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>he would play with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He bought it to tape his shows,</v>

6
00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>his live shows so that he could study</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

7
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>But he started taping conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with friends,</v>

9
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>backstage conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he also taped off all of his record</v>

10
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>library from his home so he could travel</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it because Armstrong was on the</v>

11
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>road 300 nights a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he missed his records.</v>

12
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>He loved to listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He kept the tapes because he was a very</v>

13
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>self aware person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>he wrote two autobiographies of his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thought deeply about the meaning</v>

15
00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>of his own experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he realized fairly early on that he</v>

16
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>was creating a kind of personal archive</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

17
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of information through these types.</v>

18
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>By the time of his death in 1971,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were about 650 reels of tape.</v>

19
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>They were kept after his death in a non</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate controlled attic at his house in</v>

20
00:01:18.231 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so although everybody who knew him</v>

21
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>knew about the existence of the tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was generally assumed that they</v>

22
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be playable by the time anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>got their hands on them.</v>

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't true.</v>

24
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the contents of the house became</v>

25
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:38.831
<v Speaker 1>part of the Armstrong Archive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the archivists did digital transfers of</v>

26
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:42.770
<v Speaker 1>all the tapes and they were all playable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're all in,</v>

27
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the circumstances under</v>

28
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:47.060
<v Speaker 1>which they were recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good sound.</v>

29
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I was the first person to write a book</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Armstrong,</v>

30
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who came along after these types became</v>

31
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:59.261
<v Speaker 1>available to researchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really an extraordinary</v>

32
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>experience at Armstrong was a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>unselfconscious man.</v>

33
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>So if there was ever a point at which he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was aware of the microphone,</v>

34
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it went away early.</v>

35
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>So when you listen to these tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are stepping into a time machine.</v>

36
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:21.500
<v Speaker 1>You are eavesdropping on the private</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of a great important and</v>

37
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>unselfconscious men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes he's putting on a little show.</v>

38
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>He does a little mock radio shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>there are tapes where he plays along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with old records of his tapes where he</v>

40
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>plays records for ms dot collection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>talks about them and they're fascinating</v>

41
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:39.230
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most important tapes are the</v>

42
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>candidate tapes where he simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he simply started the tape recorder</v>

43
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>during a dinner party or in his dressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>room or in the bedroom at a hotel room</v>

44
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:54.341
<v Speaker 1>after the show and just let it run and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he wants to talk about.</v>

45
00:02:54.981 --> 00:02:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the people who are with him are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about is what gets taken down on</v>

46
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>recorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

47
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.650
<v Speaker 1>I was fascinated by the idea that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapes might show us in Armstrong that we</v>

48
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:08.884
<v Speaker 1>didn't know.</v>

49
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.250
<v Speaker 1>In one sense they don't because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong was an unselfconscious person</v>

50
00:03:14.291 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and when he got onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as everybody I spoke to who knew him,</v>

51
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>told me what you saw was what you got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was what he seemed to be.</v>

52
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.900
<v Speaker 1>But in private he was more candid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think much more sharp.</v>

53
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean sharp is an intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean sharp is in,</v>

54
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>in testy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult sometimes because he had a</v>

55
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was something that he didn't show</v>

56
00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>it in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He held grudges and he talks about some</v>

57
00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>of those grudges and the tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grudges against musicians he'd worked</v>

58
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>with that he thought had double crossed</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

59
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>a managers or people who booked him that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had mistreated him.</v>

60
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>He talks very candidly about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulties he had with the gangsters</v>

61
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 1>of Chicago in 1930,</v>
<v Speaker 1>31 back when he was really having</v>

62
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 1>serious run ins with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>he talks about his marijuana arrest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1930 in California,</v>

64
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>not a subject that you would go around</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give interviews about 1960 in the</v>

65
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.823
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

66
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>You hear him getting high with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>you hear him in one amazing tape trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get his wife into bed.</v>

68
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 1>You hear him talking to girlfriends when</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife wasn't around.</v>

69
00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>You hear him talking about racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hear him talking about people he had</v>

70
00:04:27.431 --> 00:04:31.540
<v Speaker 1>logged in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music that he had loved and whatever</v>

71
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:36.070
<v Speaker 1>inhibition he felt in public about</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about certain matters is gone in</v>

72
00:04:36.071 --> 00:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>these types.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>

74
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>They bring you closer to him than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything possibly could closer even than</v>

75
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>talking to people who knew him and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to quite a few of those people.</v>

76
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not quite right to say that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't emerge in,</v>

77
00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:57.041
<v Speaker 1>in one famous episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he blew up in front of a reporter when</v>

78
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Dwight Eisenhower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was then president,</v>

79
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>was hesitating about sending the</v>
<v Speaker 1>national guard and to desegregate the</v>

80
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>schools of little rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was extremely candid on that</v>

81
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 1>occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by that time,</v>

82
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong was perceived as being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>accommodationist on racial matters by</v>

83
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.330
<v Speaker 1>younger blacks because Armstrong had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>manners of an earlier generation.</v>

84
00:05:19.331 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>He was an entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He didn't perform in public with any</v>

85
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:25.500
<v Speaker 1>kind of confrontational edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

86
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.200
<v Speaker 1>there were those who called him an uncle</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom because he had,</v>

87
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the comic mannerisms of,</v>

88
00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 1>of somebody who had grown up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>minstrel shows,</v>

89
00:05:33.251 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>which is perfectly natural for a man who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was born in New Orleans in 1901.</v>

90
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:42.270
<v Speaker 1>But in the late fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was widely perceived as being soft on</v>

91
00:05:43.391 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>these matters.</v>

92
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Since it's not soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>

93
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>When you listen to the tapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize that although he is himself</v>

94
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>devoid of any kind of racist sentiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no reverse racism and Armstrong</v>

95
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:54.980
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

96
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>he is absolutely frank about things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have happened to him about the anger</v>

97
00:06:00.171 --> 00:06:05.171
<v Speaker 1>that he feels about episodes where he</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt that he'd been mistreated,</v>

98
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:06.820
<v Speaker 1>especially in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was sometimes treated as</v>

100
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>something of a servant on the movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he made.</v>

101
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>And he speaks about them with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with great candor and great anger.</v>

102
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And if you already viewed Armstrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a proper historical perspective,</v>

103
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be shocked by this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for people who,</v>

104
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>who have this notion that Armstrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of uncle Tom Listening to the</v>

105
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 1>tapes as an Iro.</v>
