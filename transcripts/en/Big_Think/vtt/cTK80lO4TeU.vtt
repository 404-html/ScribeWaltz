1
00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Game of politics for many decades has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been played as one in which you're</v>

2
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>supposed to keep your head down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to be bland,</v>

3
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed to be uncontroversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your job is to court as many people as</v>

4
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:18.330
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the middle.</v>

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the very beginning,</v>

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>took a different posture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything he did was about unleashing</v>

7
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>the agency of a small number of intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

8
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>So this was going to be a campaign in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could unleash the things that</v>

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you'd been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're mad uncle monitoring at the</v>

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and suddenly every mat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncle mattering and the television was</v>

12
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>empowered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sent a signal by this man that those</v>

13
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>private thoughts could now be made</v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

14
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.410
<v Speaker 1>As Donald Trump's candidacy unfolded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he built and created a symbiotic</v>

15
00:00:55.711 --> 00:01:00.711
<v Speaker 1>relationship with what we think of as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vast decentralized social media army</v>

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>that did his bidding during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

17
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>These were mostly young white men on</v>
<v Speaker 1>platforms like reddit and four Chan.</v>

18
00:01:09.031 --> 00:01:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And they develop this kind of culture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competing with each other,</v>

19
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>vying with each other to produce the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most creative,</v>

20
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>the most sticky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:22.371
<v Speaker 1>the most intrusive meme or message that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would penetrate social media and then</v>

22
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>seep into the mainstream media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So everyday they would do this and in</v>

23
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 1>response to the events of the new cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be it Hillary Clinton's latest comments</v>

24
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>be at Donald Trump's latest policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouncements.</v>

25
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:39.980
<v Speaker 1>They would go take that moment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevated the mainstream media would</v>

26
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>generally confident that Hillary would</v>
<v Speaker 1>win the election.</v>

27
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>She was ahead in the polls fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently and because she had much</v>

28
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>higher favorables while both candidates</v>
<v Speaker 1>were unpopular,</v>

29
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Hillary's favorables in public opinion</v>
<v Speaker 1>polls were generally about 10 points</v>

30
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>higher than Donald Trump's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the people doing social media</v>

31
00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>sentiment analysis firms like foresee</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're tracking and finding something</v>

32
00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:05.004
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

33
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Their job is to track net sentiment on</v>
<v Speaker 1>social media.</v>

34
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm in connection to political debates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what they were finding throughout</v>

35
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the campaign was that while Donald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's favorables,</v>

36
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:18.060
<v Speaker 1>we're about 10 points lower than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary.</v>

37
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 1>His net favorable it on social media was</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 10 points higher than Hillary.</v>

38
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>One of the most striking facts we</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered when researching this book</v>

39
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>was that the day that Donald Trump had</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highest net favorability on social</v>

40
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>media was his darkest day of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>

41
00:02:37.471 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>It was the day of the access Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape being released,</v>

42
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>and it was because at that day his</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters who had such intensity of</v>

43
00:02:47.611 --> 00:02:52.611
<v Speaker 1>commitment to him rallied around him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They surged to his defense and even</v>

44
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>though it seemed in the mainstream media</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this was the day that was all</v>

45
00:02:57.361 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>losing for Donald Trump on social media</v>
<v Speaker 1>that day,</v>

46
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump actually won.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was elected because he intuitively</v>

47
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:11.491
<v Speaker 1>understood what we call new power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>new power is this ability to harness the</v>

48
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>energy of a connected crowd.</v>

49
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And while Hillary Clinton had a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional relationship with her crowd,</v>

50
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump had a relationship that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects what we now know you need to do</v>

51
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>in order to really build depth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment politically.</v>

52
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 1>So the NRA understands intensity in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way that Donald trump does.</v>

53
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 1>One of its great strengths is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>addition to its old power brand.</v>

54
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it's a feared institution</v>
<v Speaker 1>that politicians kind of quiver at the</v>

55
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:47.971
<v Speaker 1>thought of it also has an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful new power arm and that arm goes</v>

56
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>beyond just its membership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It actually has been very effective at</v>

57
00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>cultivating the most extreme elements of</v>
<v Speaker 1>its support base.</v>

58
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>If you listen to an NRA ad now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually don't really talk about</v>

59
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>guns anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk about this conspiratorial</v>

60
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pit liberals against people with</v>

61
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.820
<v Speaker 1>their values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They suggest that government is on a</v>

62
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:14.821
<v Speaker 1>mission to take away people's liberties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what they've learned is that the way</v>

63
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>to keep intensity in their crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way therefore at moments that really</v>

64
00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:22.930
<v Speaker 1>matter for it like the mansion to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill.</v>

65
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Well you remember when that bill came to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress after the newtown massacre,</v>

66
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of Americans supported</v>
<v Speaker 1>background checks in public opinion</v>

67
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet the 10 percent of people who oppose</v>

68
00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

69
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I did was at that moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>the NRA was able to rally the intensity</v>

70
00:04:40.091 --> 00:04:45.091
<v Speaker 1>of its supporters to a outnumber for gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>control forces eight to one in calls to</v>

71
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:52.861
<v Speaker 1>the key senators who were the swing</v>
<v Speaker 1>votes on that issue and the way they've</v>

72
00:04:53.141 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>done that is not by reigning in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporters,</v>

73
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>but actually unleashing their agency by</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing micro grants to small,</v>

74
00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 1>highly extreme political organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the grassroots level all over the</v>

75
00:05:08.051 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 1>country by supporting the commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture,</v>

76
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>the politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the totalizing worldview of gun</v>

77
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:21.040
<v Speaker 1>rights supporters and in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've actually been led by their</v>

78
00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>extremes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's their extremes that are helping</v>

79
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 1>them to keep the power that they have.</v>

80
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>The question that those of us who want a</v>
<v Speaker 1>world that's different to the world that</v>

81
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is building is how do we</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop him?</v>

82
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.980
<v Speaker 1>What will it take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It won't be another candidate who is</v>

83
00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>marginally more favorable or popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Donald Trump,</v>

84
00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.980
<v Speaker 1>but lacks the intensity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that capacity to mobilize new power that</v>

85
00:05:47.981 --> 00:05:51.580
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump demonstrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will need to be a candidate.</v>

86
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 1>It will need to be a movement that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>real intensity behind it.</v>

87
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think of those Parkland kids and to</v>

88
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the hope because what they're</v>

89
00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 1>showing is they understand this need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>generate intensity.</v>

90
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>They understand how to use new power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got this intuitive understanding</v>

91
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>that it's not enough just to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough just to stretch out the</v>

92
00:06:14.661 --> 00:06:19.661
<v Speaker 1>facts that you have to embody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>message in a way that means that if your</v>

93
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kid,</v>

94
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.600
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can take that,</v>

95
00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>adapt it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it your own.</v>

96
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>These movements tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>decentralized.</v>

97
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.880
<v Speaker 1>They tend to not have strict messaging</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with them and they tend to be</v>

98
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.960
<v Speaker 1>structured in such a way like the me</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

99
00:06:38.961 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Movement where you can take a frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapted an agile boards.</v>
