1
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's different every time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that years ago there wasn't,</v>

2
00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>I did do something like that at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

3
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>a magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're a journalist's x who followed me</v>

5
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>around and we tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.943
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's slightly different every time.</v>

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>My inspiration comes from everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>just walking down the street just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I never know where it's going to</v>

10
00:00:32.241 --> 00:00:34.970
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I keep a notebook with me at all</v>

11
00:00:34.971 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>and the only criteria for anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it into that notebook is if it</v>

13
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>stops me in my tracks for even an</v>
<v Speaker 1>instant.</v>

14
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>If it catches my eye or my ear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just write it down.</v>

16
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>That means there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are recipes in there,</v>

17
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are words and sometimes there's a</v>

18
00:00:56.901 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 1>character description or sometimes it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a line.</v>

19
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And after that point though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is kind of odd.</v>

20
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to,</v>

21
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I work in fragments in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to sit down and say,</v>

22
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>first line is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm going to just write my way</v>

23
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let the poem,</v>

24
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>it's like piecing it together like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pot.</v>

25
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>So I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll might have a line that I might</v>

26
00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.180
<v Speaker 1>write down on the middle of a page and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>still write things down with a pen on</v>

27
00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to the computer when,</v>

28
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.080
<v Speaker 1>when it gets too messy and use it like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an elaborate typewriter because I</v>

29
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>printed out and then I messed it up</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

30
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 1>But when I do get down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down to write in my room,</v>

31
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.060
<v Speaker 1>in my study and I tried to write there</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a certain time,</v>

32
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>every night I'm a night person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my best times or midnight to six</v>

33
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave through my notebooks and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>something catches my eye and I feel like</v>

35
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I want to transfer it from the notebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the page I do.</v>

36
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.750
<v Speaker 1>And then comes this very strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

37
00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:07.751
<v Speaker 1>which is difficult to describe and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write until I get stuck or I can't go</v>

38
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>any further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm boring myself or whatever.</v>

39
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And then I might go to another poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

40
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I might go to another folder where there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are other drafts of poems in various</v>

41
00:02:18.411 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>stages of completion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way I have for keeping</v>

42
00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:27.941
<v Speaker 1>track of all this fragment tarry stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by color.</v>

43
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>And I have different colored folders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red folders,</v>

44
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:32.090
<v Speaker 1>blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yellow.</v>

45
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 1>So I might go into my study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say one evening and say I feel</v>

46
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>like the blue folder today</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not pick up the blue folder and see</v>

47
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 1>what's in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's something that I've kind of</v>

48
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:50.660
<v Speaker 1>worked at over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the colors are only because I didn't</v>

49
00:02:50.661 --> 00:02:53.740
<v Speaker 1>want to put anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to file anything in a,</v>

50
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 1>in a straight.</v>

51
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you put something in a file</v>

52
00:02:58.401 --> 00:03:03.401
<v Speaker 1>that says war poems or loved pumps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you already restrict the way in</v>

53
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>which the poem might move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I put it in blue,</v>

54
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it could be sad blue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be happy blue,</v>

55
00:03:11.351 --> 00:03:16.351
<v Speaker 1>it can be peaceful blue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my mood at the moment when I'm about</v>

56
00:03:16.931 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>to work on that poem once will tell me</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I want to go.</v>

57
00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's an odd process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do do lots of revisions and I love</v>

58
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:27.380
<v Speaker 1>to revise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

59
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Speaker 1>so 30 40 revisions is not unusual at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stage.</v>

60
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do most of my revisions by myself</v>

61
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:42.211
<v Speaker 1>until I reach a point where I either</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to give it lots of time because</v>

62
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>time is a great reviser too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.630
<v Speaker 1>months of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of putting it aside or I will show it.</v>

64
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times I'll show it to my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my husband who is a novelist and as a</v>

65
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>prose writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has a totally different take on</v>

66
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

67
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>So he comes at it a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I yearn for those old days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>both from graduate school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>You go into a workshop and people would</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you all these ideas and you take it</v>

71
00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 1>away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at this point,</v>

72
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't,</v>

73
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

74
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that you certainly don't</v>

75
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:27.670
<v Speaker 1>have to be aged and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

76
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 1>and travel the world to write a poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

77
00:04:29.951 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>sometimes traveling the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

78
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 1>is a way of not writing a poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the quality of experiences</v>

79
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 1>being able to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience something.</v>

80
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.300
<v Speaker 1>And when you begin to write about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to apply the tools that you need</v>

81
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>for writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>a mastery of the language in a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

83
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:54.281
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

84
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 1>of piecing together the language I</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess,</v>

85
00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that those two factors have to come</v>

86
00:05:00.521 --> 00:05:01.354
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

87
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.390
<v Speaker 1>So you do need to be to work at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to be able to know</v>

88
00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.960
<v Speaker 1>when to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when to take the experience as it</v>

89
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went to tweak it a little bit.</v>

90
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 1>What part of the experience is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move somebody else.</v>

91
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And what part is really your own?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.620
<v Speaker 1>private moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've,</v>

93
00:05:23.621 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I've seen pumps written by very young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

94
00:05:26.771 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>which are absolutely stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we have examples,</v>

95
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:33.280
<v Speaker 1>look bored layer and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was in his teens,</v>

96
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>and these are amazing poem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he obviously didn't have a wealth of</v>

97
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>experience or age or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen poems,</v>

98
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>which of course could only have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>written by someone who was older and had</v>

99
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.910
<v Speaker 1>lived certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.670
<v Speaker 1>stages of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone through certain stages of</v>

101
00:05:51.671 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a combination of the two.</v>

102
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

103
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.030
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always felt that,</v>

104
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.370
<v Speaker 2>that the poems I've written,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which have historical context,</v>

105
00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are hopefully not just simply plucking</v>

106
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:12.640
<v Speaker 2>something out of history and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

107
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:16.060
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's write about that in every case.</v>

108
00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:21.061
<v Speaker 2>What has happened is that I've become</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinated or haunted by something and</v>

109
00:06:21.521 --> 00:06:24.370
<v Speaker 2>couldn't shake it as an African</v>
<v Speaker 2>American,</v>

110
00:06:24.371 --> 00:06:29.371
<v Speaker 2>as a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I've been sensitized to the</v>

111
00:06:29.741 --> 00:06:32.340
<v Speaker 2>way in which history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

112
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.380
<v Speaker 2>privileges of white male and the way in</v>
<v Speaker 2>which certain aspects of history,</v>

113
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.520
<v Speaker 2>the things that we are taught in school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that are handed down,</v>

114
00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never entered the picture that they</v>

115
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.060
<v Speaker 2>might've been very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you want can tell you that,</v>

116
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the risk of over simplification,</v>

117
00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>let me say that anyone can tell you</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

118
00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.070
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that how you're raised as a child has a</v>

119
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.060
<v Speaker 2>great deal to do with how you behave as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an adult.</v>

120
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:04.090
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you have complexes or whether</v>

121
00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.400
<v Speaker 2>you need to prove yourself or all kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of stuff.</v>

122
00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.430
<v Speaker 2>And yet</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mother in a traditional family who</v>

123
00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:15.190
<v Speaker 2>has raised a chuck never makes it in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history books.</v>

124
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

125
00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:20.740
<v Speaker 2>so those kinds of things have always</v>
<v Speaker 2>irritated me,</v>

126
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:22.450
<v Speaker 2>let's put it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

127
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm always reminded when I,</v>

128
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.820
<v Speaker 2>when I see someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

129
00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Napoleon's stocks through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefields,</v>

130
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:30.720
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

131
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.990
<v Speaker 2>but how did he get that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

132
00:07:31.991 --> 00:07:35.500
<v Speaker 2>how this guy become who he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>

133
00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:39.820
<v Speaker 2>that's the predisposition I had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think us as a writer,</v>

134
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 2>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

135
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.360
<v Speaker 2>who wanted to create a poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the things that has always</v>

136
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 2>been one of my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.500
<v Speaker 2>the things I carry along with me</v>
<v Speaker 2>each time is different.</v>

138
00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this new book,</v>

139
00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:57.070
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

140
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:58.180
<v Speaker 2>tells the story of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

141
00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.320
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

142
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 2>black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

143
00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 2>mixed race violin is George Bridge Tower</v>
<v Speaker 2>who grew up in 18th and 19th century</v>

144
00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:07.414
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

145
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 2>I came upon him because I was watching a</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie,</v>

146
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:12.370
<v Speaker 2>immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beloved.</v>

147
00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:17.490
<v Speaker 2>And there was a scene which Beethoven</v>
<v Speaker 2>walks by group of musicians and there's</v>

148
00:08:17.921 --> 00:08:19.240
<v Speaker 2>this black violin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm like,</v>

149
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.460
<v Speaker 2>what I've heard of Colin's like casting</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a bit strange.</v>

150
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:29.850
<v Speaker 2>And so I looked him up and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't intend to write poems about it.</v>

151
00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just wanted to know more about him and</v>

152
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:40.110
<v Speaker 2>I kept reading in the more red,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I realized the only way I was</v>

153
00:08:40.151 --> 00:08:45.151
<v Speaker 2>going to get him out of my head was to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get into his and start writing by him.</v>

154
00:08:46.421 --> 00:08:47.800
<v Speaker 2>So in each case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

155
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 2>it's been something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
