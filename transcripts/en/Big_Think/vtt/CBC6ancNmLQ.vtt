1
00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.200
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to say that you're my favorite</v>

2
00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>person ever in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but my question is,</v>

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 1>do you think we can build our own</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor day?</v>

4
00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm Frankenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sewing together body parts and</v>

5
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:23.951
<v Speaker 1>somehow reanimating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's possible because you</v>

6
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>seem like the person to ask this anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you so much.</v>

7
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>I hope to see a big think</v>

8
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 2>reanimating people from different body</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>

9
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Probably not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something even more amazing is about</v>

10
00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 2>to happen in biology and genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

11
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:49.991
<v Speaker 2>one cliff point of clarification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Frankenstein created what came to be</v>

12
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 2>called Frankenstein's monster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The monster himself was not really</v>

13
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:58.850
<v Speaker 2>called Frankenstein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little,</v>

14
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 2>a little science fiction point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest there.</v>

15
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.720
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 2>what will probably happen in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifetime,</v>

17
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:11.561
<v Speaker 2>just judging how old you appear on big</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is people will be able people like</v>

18
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:16.661
<v Speaker 2>you will be able to regenerate parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body using your own cells that a</v>

19
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.470
<v Speaker 2>technologists in medicine and genetics</v>
<v Speaker 2>are finding ways to get your own body,</v>

20
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 2>to create more cells that it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it didn't use to be able to create.</v>

21
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 2>Like if you need a new pancreas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be able to grow your own</v>

22
00:01:33.621 --> 00:01:36.830
<v Speaker 2>pancreas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know about complex</v>

23
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 2>mechanical systems like hands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers,</v>

24
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't seem beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the technology that's being developed</v>

26
00:01:46.161 --> 00:01:51.161
<v Speaker 2>right now because in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people came to appreciate the</v>

27
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 2>significance of stem cells.</v>

28
00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>These are cells that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 2>have plenty of potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can be anything when you're a</v>

30
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 2>blastocyst,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before you become a take on the form of</v>

31
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:09.791
<v Speaker 2>a human or what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the acronym is Crispr and the,</v>

32
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the p there is palindrome</v>

33
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.890
<v Speaker 2>Palindromic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the same at both ends,</v>

34
00:02:15.891 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 2>the same backwards and forwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so people are being or finding ways,</v>

35
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:24.530
<v Speaker 2>geneticists are finding ways to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>cells to do whatever they want,</v>

36
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 2>whenever they want them to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's presumed that instead of making</v>

37
00:02:28.611 --> 00:02:33.611
<v Speaker 2>a monster akin to Dr Frankenstein's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fictional creature by assembling pieces</v>

38
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.320
<v Speaker 2>of from disparate other humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

39
00:02:39.321 --> 00:02:44.321
<v Speaker 2>you'd get each person's own cells to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a regenerate body parts or,</v>

40
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.513
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

41
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.010
<v Speaker 2>maybe in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

42
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 2>in the womb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>create extraordinary people that were</v>

43
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 2>extraordinarily smart with extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 2>skills and dunking basketballs or have</v>

44
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of taking your</v>

45
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:06.631
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and putting it in another</v>
<v Speaker 2>device or another system or another</v>

46
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another person,</v>

47
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 2>another biological system is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been around for a long time.</v>

48
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.320
<v Speaker 2>Science fiction has got it for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and I'm always charmed by the</v>

49
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:25.351
<v Speaker 2>singularity when brains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when computers are going to be as</v>

50
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 2>complex and sophisticated as a human</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain and uh,</v>

51
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this moment in history is called the</v>

52
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'll just download all of</v>

53
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>your memories and all of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences into this electronic</v>

54
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 2>presumed electronic storage system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you would live as long as</v>

55
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 2>you're plugged in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you have electricity,</v>

56
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Speaker 2>what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just seems way more complicated than</v>

57
00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not something I would ever count on.</v>

58
00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 2>And I don't think you can really be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole person in the way it.</v>

59
00:04:02.571 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>You seem to be here on camera without</v>
<v Speaker 2>your census,</v>

60
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>without your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ears,</v>

61
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:09.660
<v Speaker 2>nose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on,</v>

62
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>feeling the world around you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so called your,</v>

63
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.250
<v Speaker 2>your so called central nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of your brain.</v>

64
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's that simple to put a</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain in another body and carry on or</v>

65
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 2>put your consciousness and electrical</v>
<v Speaker 2>receptacle and carry on,</v>

66
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 2>but you may be living at a time when</v>
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary things will be done with</v>

67
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:36.481
<v Speaker 2>your own cells that will far surpass</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything that Dr. Frankenstein in the</v>

68
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 2>story was able to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exciting.</v>

69
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Carry on.</v>
