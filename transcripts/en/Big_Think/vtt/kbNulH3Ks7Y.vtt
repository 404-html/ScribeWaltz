WEBVTT

1
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>With transformative technology and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the transformative technology lab,</v>

2
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 1>we're tracking 10 major areas of Trans</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tech and those 10 areas include things</v>

3
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:22.781
<v Speaker 1>like neurofeedback and biofeedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurostim and bio stem.</v>

4
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Those are the ones that I think people</v>
<v Speaker 1>would think of the most.</v>

5
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 1>A good example of that would be the Muse</v>
<v Speaker 1>headset by interacts on that measures</v>

6
00:00:35.031 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>your eeg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so measures your brain waves.</v>

7
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Another thing that's coming out is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuro stem.</v>

8
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>A good example of that would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company called Halo neuroscience,</v>

9
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>and so it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a.</v>

10
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a slight stimulation to the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in their trials with elite</v>

11
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:59.621
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're showing people having big surges</v>

12
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>in ability and so that's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

13
00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:08.381
<v Speaker 1>There's another product called think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sits on the forehead right here and</v>

14
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:13.541
<v Speaker 1>it stimulates the peripheral nerves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>short of it could replace a cup of</v>

15
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>coffee so it sort of stimulates you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wakes you up.</v>

16
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of focus on things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are taking feedback from the body and</v>

17
00:01:24.261 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>then stimulating the body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it could be the body or the</v>

18
00:01:28.311 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that is coming is a</v>

19
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:36.851
<v Speaker 1>lot of vegas nerve stimulation and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>the on the medical side,</v>

20
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>there's research that's recently come</v>
<v Speaker 1>out where people are really taking that</v>

21
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>more seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the things that I think are</v>

23
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:53.951
<v Speaker 1>really cool is I'm really intrigued by</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion recognition software,</v>

24
00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.480
<v Speaker 1>whether that's through cameras that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching facial expressions eye or</v>

25
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>or another example would be there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company called beyond verbal that just</v>

27
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:13.460
<v Speaker 1>off of the audio files can pick up human</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

28
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

29
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of what's the use of that?</v>

30
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I know how I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually,</v>

31
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when everything in your house is smart,</v>

32
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you're really going to want to want it</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know if you're upset or sad or not.</v>

33
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're upset or not.</v>

34
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:29.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an older friend that I bought an Amazon</v>

36
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 1>Echo for and she whispers around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>echo,</v>

37
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>like it's a real person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is someone who's in there who's in</v>

38
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:43.160
<v Speaker 1>their seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for people who are growing up in</v>

39
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.340
<v Speaker 1>smart houses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know a lot of children today,</v>

40
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 1>they won't even know a time where there</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't a certain level of intelligence</v>

41
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 1>that's baked into their environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to want all these things to</v>

42
00:02:56.331 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>know how we feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that emotion recognition is</v>

43
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that's captured my</v>

44
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 1>imagination right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of interest right now in</v>

45
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:14.221
<v Speaker 1>neuro stem and a lot of that is based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a series of studies that were done by</v>

46
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:20.461
<v Speaker 1>Darpa where they were using slight</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical stimulation and saw a</v>

47
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:26.221
<v Speaker 1>increase in task acquisition for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in various roles in the military.</v>

48
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>The one that's the most well known is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the increase or the acceleration for</v>

49
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:39.091
<v Speaker 1>sharp shooters from novice to expert</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the application of a slight</v>

50
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>electrical stimulation while they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>

51
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people who are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in that.</v>

52
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>There's actually a really large do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself community around the world</v>

53
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
<v Speaker 1>where people are doing citizen</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent science really and do it</v>

54
00:03:55.631 --> 00:04:00.631
<v Speaker 1>yourself science and using various</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of electrical currency on their</v>

55
00:04:01.121 --> 00:04:04.750
<v Speaker 1>own brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then sharing it in forums and</v>

56
00:04:04.751 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>communicating about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been trying electrical</v>

57
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>stimulation with physical task</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition,</v>

58
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.070
<v Speaker 1>also language tests acquisition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those things that there's</v>

59
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.120
<v Speaker 1>products that are being based on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

60
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.700
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole category of things with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a called transcranial direct</v>

61
00:04:24.701 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 1>stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a lot of products out</v>

62
00:04:27.821 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>there on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the brand names that you might</v>

63
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>find would be focus is one.</v>

64
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 1>Halo neuroscience is another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the think product is another.</v>

65
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And so it's starting to have commercial</v>
<v Speaker 1>products for it.</v>

66
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there also was a,</v>

67
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of the medical community</v>

68
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 1>is a little concerned about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a good example of where people,</v>

69
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>individuals are really sort of pushing</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of where the medical community is</v>

70
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.580
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>what's a good idea for what levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulation you should have,</v>

72
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.470
<v Speaker 1>how often and where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>what part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the brain that you try to stimulate</v>

74
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>through the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really,</v>

75
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:20.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting space and people are</v>

76
00:05:20.831 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>pushing into it.</v>
