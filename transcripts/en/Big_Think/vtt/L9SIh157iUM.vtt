00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I think this country is ready for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>black president.</v>

2
00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because he's black,</v>

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>not because everyone's come to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>great racial understanding,</v>

4
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:20.931
<v Speaker 1>but because he is who he is and because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his character,</v>

5
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>and because he is who he is as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual and what he stands for and</v>

6
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of campaign he has run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think America is ready for Barack</v>

8
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Obama to be president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they would have been</v>

9
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>ready for another black man to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

10
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>but this black man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're ready for him to be</v>

11
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>
