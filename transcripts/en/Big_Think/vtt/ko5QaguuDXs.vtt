1
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:15.130
<v Speaker 2>imaging technology is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a wonderful enabler of disruption</v>

3
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:22.331
<v Speaker 2>because in the past the doctor could</v>
<v Speaker 2>only listen to find out what's going on</v>

4
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 2>in your heart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your body,</v>

5
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 2>or they could feel and they just have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>use their intuition is this normal,</v>

6
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 2>abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They miss a lot of stuff,</v>

7
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 2>but from a company in Seattle called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sonos side,</v>

8
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 2>as well as from a spinoff of GE medical</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems,</v>

9
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 2>there are now little handheld ultrasound</v>
<v Speaker 2>machines that are very affordable for a</v>

10
00:00:46.461 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 2>personal care physician to buy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially what it is is a visual</v>

11
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 2>stethoscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead of listening and feeling that</v>

12
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Dr just during a physical exam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just looks inside of your body and,</v>

13
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as a consequence,</v>

14
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:08.891
<v Speaker 2>they can see things much earlier and</v>
<v Speaker 2>take action mature earlier than you</v>

15
00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:14.261
<v Speaker 2>could if you had to wait until a tumor</v>
<v Speaker 2>got big enough that you could feel at or</v>

16
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 2>we're experiencing the consequences.</v>

17
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 2>And that brings the ability to look</v>
<v Speaker 2>inside the body right to the doctor's</v>

18
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:26.690
<v Speaker 2>office for much more accurate diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At much lower cost.</v>

19
00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm in general imaging technologies have</v>
<v Speaker 2>preempted what we used to call</v>

20
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 2>exploratory surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you couldn't look inside the body,</v>

21
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 2>you had to cut it open to see what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on and now just being able to look</v>

22
00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 2>makes it a lot more affordable and</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

23
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>Now those machines are very expensive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you have to go take your problem</v>

24
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 2>to the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but their technology is in development</v>

25
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:59.921
<v Speaker 2>now that will decentralize the ability</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look inside the body like this little</v>

26
00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:05.141
<v Speaker 2>handheld ultrasound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other exciting one is the advent of</v>

27
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 2>molecular diagnostics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that the body has a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited vocabulary,</v>

29
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 2>but it can draw upon when it needs to</v>
<v Speaker 2>express that something has gone wrong</v>

30
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 2>and the body's vocabulary are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's physical symptoms.</v>

31
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.940
<v Speaker 2>The problem is there just aren't nearly</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough symptoms to go around for all the</v>

32
00:02:28.941 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 2>diseases that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the diseases had to get together</v>

33
00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:38.141
<v Speaker 2>and agree to share symptoms of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem then is when you diagnose a</v>

34
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:44.231
<v Speaker 2>disease symptom and it's caused by</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple different factors,</v>

35
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.340
<v Speaker 2>you cannot have a rules based therapy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the therapy that works for one</v>

36
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:57.350
<v Speaker 2>patient who's been diagnosed with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>symptomatic disease may not work for</v>

37
00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>another patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because there are multiple causes of</v>

38
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:05.551
<v Speaker 2>those symptoms and before we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't understand that care could</v>

39
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 2>only be provided through the wisdom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience and intuition of highly</v>

40
00:03:12.701 --> 00:03:17.620
<v Speaker 2>trained doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the genomics revolution has really</v>

41
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.580
<v Speaker 2>enabled us to understand at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular level what these diseases</v>

42
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>truly are now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

43
00:03:27.131 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>we thought there was a disease called</v>
<v Speaker 2>type two diabetes</v>

44
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed when you've got elevated</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels of glucose in your blood.</v>

45
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 2>Turns out that there are about 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>different diseases that agreed to share</v>

46
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.520
<v Speaker 2>elevated blood glucose as their symptom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in the past you couldn't treat</v>

47
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 2>all type two diabetics the same way</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the response was highly variable</v>

48
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>and now we understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh gosh,</v>

49
00:03:55.571 --> 00:04:00.571
<v Speaker 2>it's because diabetes isn't the disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's those causes that are the disease</v>

50
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.870
<v Speaker 2>and molecular diagnosis is enabling us</v>
<v Speaker 2>one by one to figure out exactly which</v>

51
00:04:08.171 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 2>of those you have that then is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>precursor or the prerequisite to the</v>

52
00:04:13.001 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 2>development of a predictable therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

53
00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.860
<v Speaker 2>cancer is going through this transition</v>
<v Speaker 2>in just a marvelous way.</v>

54
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880
<v Speaker 2>So we used to diagnose cancer and define</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disease by geography.</v>

55
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 2>So you had brain cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood cancer,</v>

56
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 2>bone cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>breast cancer,</v>

57
00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>and you would treat patients who were</v>
<v Speaker 2>diagnosed in that way with a radiation</v>

58
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:43.690
<v Speaker 2>or chemotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One patient would respond and then the</v>

59
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 2>next patient wouldn't respond to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>very same therapy and so you just had to</v>

60
00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 2>leave it to the intuition of the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctors you could find,</v>

61
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.990
<v Speaker 2>but now we understand that that's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>the disease.</v>

62
00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 2>In breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

63
00:04:58.811 --> 00:05:03.811
<v Speaker 2>there are about six different tumors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each of which can be characterized by</v>

64
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:09.331
<v Speaker 2>the unique molecular pathway by which</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tumor propagates and so there are</v>

65
00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 2>six diseases there in that location.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One,</v>

66
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.030
<v Speaker 2>but understanding them that you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>these different types of tumors,</v>

67
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 2>allows you then to begin developing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy that is appropriate and</v>

68
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:28.771
<v Speaker 2>predictably effective for that type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>tumor and it turns out that each of</v>

69
00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 2>those types of tumor doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tumors just doesn't rise only in the</v>

70
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.650
<v Speaker 2>breast but arises elsewhere in the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

71
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 2>And so our ability to cure cancer or to</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it into long term remission is much</v>

72
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:49.510
<v Speaker 2>greater now than it was 10 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of these molecular diagnostics.</v>

73
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 2>Cervical cancer now is a very well</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood disease.</v>

74
00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 2>We understand its causes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>virus in care at that point when you</v>

75
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:05.351
<v Speaker 2>have a an ambiguous diagnosis followed</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a predictably effective therapy and</v>

76
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 2>nurse can actually provide that care</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as well as the doctor could,</v>

77
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>and that's very exciting.</v>
