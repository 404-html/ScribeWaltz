00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everything,</v>

2
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.800
<v Speaker 1>whether it's filmmaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photography,</v>

3
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>especially in electronic music 20 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

5
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 1>making electronic music was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

6
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to have obscure pieces of</v>

7
00:00:28.031 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>equipment and you had to figure out how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make them all talk to each other.</v>

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>And so finding the equipment was</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>

9
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Getting it to work was difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now everything exists on a laptop,</v>

10
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like individual pieces of software</v>

11
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>that do everything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on one hand,</v>

12
00:00:45.041 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I love that because it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>egalitarian and the software worked</v>

13
00:00:48.671 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>flawlessly and it sounds great and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone can use it.</v>

14
00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.930
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 1>we run the risk of everybody being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>artist,</v>

16
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>which on one hand is great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just means that if everyone's an</v>

17
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>artist who's ever going to stop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to what other people are doing,</v>

18
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if everybody's making music,</v>

19
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>then everyone's just clamoring to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>their music listened to,</v>

20
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>which might not be such a bad thing.</v>

21
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>my website,</v>

22
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:23.741
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] dot com started in I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>1999 99 or 2000 and it started just as a</v>

23
00:01:24.831 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>way of making people aware of upcoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows.</v>

24
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>And it sort of evolved into a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that,</v>

25
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>especially as bandwidth increased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me.</v>

26
00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>The website is just a fun way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating directly with people.</v>

27
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the old days the only way you could</v>

28
00:01:40.671 --> 00:01:44.480
<v Speaker 1>communicate with an audience member was</v>
<v Speaker 1>through like,</v>

29
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different media outlets or through the</v>

30
00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 1>gatekeepers at the record company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I can communicate very directly.</v>

31
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>And I also just recently started a</v>
<v Speaker 1>website called [inaudible] dot com that</v>

32
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.180
<v Speaker 1>takes music that I've made and gives it</v>
<v Speaker 1>away for free to independent filmmakers</v>

33
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 1>and film students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.940
<v Speaker 1>and that goes through moby.com as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started moby gradis.com cause a lot of</v>

35
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>my friends who are independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>filmmakers are film students complained</v>

36
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>that the hardest part about making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>film is actually trying to license</v>

37
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

38
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>cause they don't have budgets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the record companies don't return</v>

39
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>their calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The publishing companies don't return</v>

40
00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>their calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I started [inaudible] as a way to</v>

41
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>just give free music to my friends who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are independent film makers.</v>

42
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And the response from that community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the independent film community has been</v>

43
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've had about 8,000 uses so far.</v>

44
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:31.844
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been using,</v>

45
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>well not 8,000 different films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 8,000 different uses.</v>

46
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've only,</v>

47
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:38.540
<v Speaker 1>thus far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

48
00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>publicized it to people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent film.</v>

49
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
