1
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been</v>

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 1>two ways that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this economic expansion,</v>

3
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.601
<v Speaker 1>it's subsidized by the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is just the sort of non market</v>

4
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most notably say greenhouse gas</v>

5
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>pollution at the all of us who use that</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution,</v>

6
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:30.901
<v Speaker 1>but those who sell it to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly your responsible for a huge</v>

7
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>environmental impact that they are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for a,</v>

8
00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>but they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem is compounded by the</v>

9
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:44.671
<v Speaker 1>addition of subsidies by governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's one estimate that the</v>

10
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:50.161
<v Speaker 1>environmentally perverse subsidies</v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally now amount to perhaps a</v>

11
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.110
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least $800,000,000,000 a year.</v>

12
00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an energy.</v>

13
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:03.841
<v Speaker 1>It's an agriculture and transportation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that further distorts the price</v>

14
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.470
<v Speaker 1>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>

15
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>we have these environmentally dishonest</v>
<v Speaker 1>prices.</v>

16
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.670
<v Speaker 1>This basic system then is compounded by</v>
<v Speaker 1>three other things.</v>

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first is an enormous,</v>

18
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way that corporations are set up.</v>

19
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>We've now charter corporations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>established corporate law,</v>

20
00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says in effect,</v>

21
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the overwhelming duty of the corporation</v>

22
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>is to maximize the wealth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholders.</v>

23
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>This is the so called shareholder</v>
<v Speaker 1>primacy,</v>

24
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.650
<v Speaker 1>best interest of the corporation</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle.</v>

25
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally outmoded and in my view,</v>

26
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean we ought to be exploring</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigorously a system where the</v>

27
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>corporation is governed by and beholding</v>
<v Speaker 1>to all of those that contribute to the</v>

28
00:01:58.661 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>wealth that the shareholder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the cooperation produces.</v>

29
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>And that would include local</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>

30
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>it would include workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>so it's a fundamental change in the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that corporations are set up and the</v>

32
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:14.791
<v Speaker 1>incentives that they operate under.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second pillar of this is less,</v>

33
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our,</v>

34
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pathetic capitulation to</v>

35
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.590
<v Speaker 1>consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's manipulated endlessly by</v>

37
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>advertisers and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and marketing and we succumb easily,</v>

38
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

40
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and off we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>and that is certainly a huge pillar of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

42
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third,</v>

43
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>a is government itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state,</v>

44
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>the state can raise extra revenues</v>
<v Speaker 1>without raising tax rates by growing a,</v>

45
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>it can keep social issues on the back</v>
<v Speaker 1>burner by pointing to the expansion of</v>

46
00:02:56.651 --> 00:03:00.500
<v Speaker 1>the economy as a solution to social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.460
<v Speaker 1>growth enhances the projection of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>in international,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a competitive international system.</v>

49
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>So governments that are deeply hooked on</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth.</v>

50
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>So this is the basic complex and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormously powerful.</v>

51
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 1>And the environmental community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>this is simply a unable to cope with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>full burden of that system.</v>

53
00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.093
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

54
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.240
<v Speaker 1>already clear that if we had a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had environmentally honest prices</v>

55
00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:39.010
<v Speaker 1>and indeed socially honest prices and</v>
<v Speaker 1>militarily honest prices,</v>

56
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>prices would be a lot higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot higher,</v>

57
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>both in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reaction of people would be to</v>

58
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>shift good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift their activities out of the</v>

59
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in many ways is a wonderful thing</v>

60
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>because it means we would be spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>more time with our families,</v>

61
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>more time with our communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more time with the natural world.</v>

62
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>And it would also mean the activities</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are environmentally destructive</v>

63
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>would cost a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot more.</v>

64
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the effect of this is to,</v>

65
00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>shift our consumer patterns towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are environmentally</v>

67
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>regenerative or benign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

68
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>but they're huge equity issues here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's why in the book I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.180
<v Speaker 1>go approach in several ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the link between dealing with our</v>

72
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.040
<v Speaker 1>environmental issues and dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social justice issues in our</v>

73
00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:36.874
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

74
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a crisis of social inequality in</v>

75
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>America as well as an environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

76
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 1>a soaring executive pay a and earnings</v>
<v Speaker 1>in is the top one percent of the</v>

77
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:54.000
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:59.460
<v Speaker 1>and a widening gap between the very rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rest of the country.</v>

79
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Poverty rates at an all time high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>over 10 percent of the public facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger still in our country,</v>

81
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>if you can believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.780
<v Speaker 1>in a one percent of the adult population</v>
<v Speaker 1>in jail,</v>

83
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 1>a failing schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented proportion of the society</v>

85
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 1>with a out health insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just tremendous social insecurity</v>

87
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:30.910
<v Speaker 1>among most people in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half the families in the country make</v>

88
00:05:30.911 --> 00:05:35.510
<v Speaker 1>less than about $45,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The family,</v>

89
00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.520
<v Speaker 1>it could be pretty big and they and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the average of that half is well</v>

90
00:05:41.321 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>below 45 of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically,</v>

91
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a society with tremendous wealth</v>

92
00:05:46.781 --> 00:05:49.980
<v Speaker 1>and tremendous capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very concentrated and it spent</v>

93
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.650
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

94
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not spent on promoting social</v>
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing in our society.</v>

95
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.641
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

96
00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the environmental pictures,</v>

97
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>no prettier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we really have is a system that</v>

98
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 1>cares profoundly about profits and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reinvesting a large share of them and</v>

99
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.620
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't really care much at all about</v>

100
00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>people society or the natural world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's embedded.</v>

101
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's up to us as citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the main tool that we have,</v>

102
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.950
<v Speaker 1>which is government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>to inject a real values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.200
<v Speaker 1>other values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human values,</v>

105
00:06:27.201 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 1>longterm values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>caring values,</v>

106
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>compassionate values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural values into the system.</v>

107
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where we fail too often and</v>

108
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:42.071
<v Speaker 1>failed in a big way because our politics</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so enfeebled today,</v>

109
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the corporate control of our</v>

110
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>politics is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so strong,</v>

111
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:51.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were failing.</v>

112
00:06:51.281 --> 00:06:54.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is that we're all</v>

113
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:58.840
<v Speaker 1>similarly situated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are trying to succeed in,</v>

114
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in projecting values for about future</v>

115
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 1>generations and about the natural world</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that system are failing just for</v>

116
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:11.621
<v Speaker 1>the same reasons that those who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to project into that system or</v>

117
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>inject into that system values about</v>
<v Speaker 1>social justice and social wellbeing and</v>

118
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.360
<v Speaker 1>social cohesion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.940
