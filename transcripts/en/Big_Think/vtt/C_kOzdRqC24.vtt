1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 2>what I be sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to do this,</v>

3
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 2>understand human nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how the mind works,</v>

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 2>what makes us tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the patterns of thought and</v>

5
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:26.360
<v Speaker 2>emotion and motivation that characterize</v>
<v Speaker 2>our species.</v>

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I focus on language partly because you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't make a living out of studying</v>

7
00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too big a topic.</v>

8
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 2>You've got to pick something tractable</v>
<v Speaker 2>to study.</v>

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 2>For me it is has been language in a deed</v>
<v Speaker 2>for much of my career,</v>

10
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 2>one little corner of language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely a regular and irregular verbs and</v>

11
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 2>I have my reasons for focusing on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular corner.</v>

12
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 2>I think it does shed light on larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions about what makes the,</v>

13
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 2>the mind work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 2>but language is a general topic is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a good entree into human nature</v>

15
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 2>for a number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's distinctively human if you're</v>

16
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>interested in general in what makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>humans,</v>

17
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 2>unlike a mice and birds language is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty good place to start.</v>

18
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Not only because of language itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we make noise with our</v>

19
00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:20.471
<v Speaker 2>mouths in order to get ideas across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because language has to be fine</v>

20
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 2>tuned for the kind of thoughts and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of social relationships that humans</v>

21
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 2>want to share and negotiate with one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

22
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 2>So it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a window into human nature.</v>

23
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.040
<v Speaker 2>It's also figured in debates on human</v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

24
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 2>perhaps most famously with Chomsky in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the late fifties,</v>

25
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.480
<v Speaker 2>using language as a way to rehabilitate</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of innate mental structure.</v>

26
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>Something that was virtually taboo in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 fifties.</v>

27
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 2>He said language is a very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>candidate for something that is innately</v>

28
00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:57.311
<v Speaker 2>and uniquely human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's an opening wedge for the idea</v>

29
00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:58.610
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 2>that important parts of the mind are</v>
<v Speaker 2>innately structured.</v>

31
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 2>It's also a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a prime case of mental computation.</v>

32
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 2>It's very hard to make sense of language</v>
<v Speaker 2>of our ability to string words into new</v>

33
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 2>combinations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sentences that other people have never</v>

34
00:02:16.881 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 2>heard before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but can very quickly understand for the</v>

35
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 2>first time without appealing to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have a,</v>

36
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 2>a mental algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of rules or a recipe or a formula</v>

37
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 2>that picks words out of a memory store</v>
<v Speaker 2>and strings them together in</v>

38
00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 2>combinations where the order as well as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the choice of words is meaningful.</v>

39
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 2>So language sheds light on the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind is a computational system.</v>

40
00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 2>I did what I think is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't for a long time will be the most</v>

41
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 2>exhaustive study of one aspect of child</v>
<v Speaker 2>language development.</v>

42
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.070
<v Speaker 2>The fact that kids make errors like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.273
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we holding the baby rabbits,</v>

45
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.300
<v Speaker 2>the alligator gold kerplunk where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>add a regular suffolk's like ed to an</v>

46
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>irregular verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a hold or here,</v>

47
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 2>or stick producing errors like stick to</v>
<v Speaker 2>tared and hold,</v>

48
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I analyzed 20,000 of those forms from</v>

49
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 2>computer transcripts of children</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing language and developed a</v>

50
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 2>theory of why kids make that error,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>how they outgrow it and what it shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>about language.</v>

52
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 2>The reason to obsess over a tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 2>topic like that is that it's a nice</v>

53
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:39.331
<v Speaker 2>illustration of children's creativity in</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquiring language that the essence of</v>

54
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:45.031
<v Speaker 2>language is that you aren't restricted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a fixed list of messages that you've</v>

55
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 2>memorized and that you then regurgitate</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a parrot.</v>

56
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>Rather you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you recreate me combined elements to</v>

57
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 2>create new messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every sentence that we utter is a brand</v>

58
00:03:56.471 --> 00:03:59.890
<v Speaker 2>new sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's rather hard to study the</v>

59
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 2>process of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of kids making up new sentences when a</v>

60
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 2>kid says something like strict or tiered</v>
<v Speaker 2>or hear it or hold it.</v>

61
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a tiny example of recombination</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is the engine that powers</v>

62
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 2>language as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

63
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

64
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:23.401
<v Speaker 2>the act of children making an error like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is a way of catching them</v>

65
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 2>in the act of doing something that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>language powerful.</v>

66
00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Namely combining things by rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in trying to understand that one</v>

67
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope that we,</v>

68
00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 2>my students and I shed light on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>process of linguistic generativity or</v>

69
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 2>creativity in general.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

70
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I also</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried very hard to crack the code of</v>

71
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:51.421
<v Speaker 2>what verbs mean and how that influences</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we use them in sentences.</v>

72
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 2>The verb is in a way the chassis of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sentence,</v>

73
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 2>once you pick the verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got slots that the rest of the</v>

74
00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 2>sentence a is built around the subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the object,</v>

75
00:05:02.891 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 2>the indirect object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepositional objects and so on.</v>

76
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.370
<v Speaker 2>So knowing how the verb works tells you</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot about how the sentence works and</v>

77
00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 2>how the verb works depends on what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>verb means.</v>

78
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 2>You might think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could you ever get your,</v>

79
00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get a handle on something as nebulous as</v>

80
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>what a verb means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

81
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like to think that,</v>

82
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

83
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I cracked a lot of that code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the difference between a verb,</v>

84
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 2>like to fill in a verb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like to pour and a verb,</v>

85
00:05:35.771 --> 00:05:40.771
<v Speaker 2>like to load.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not just a video images in the</v>

86
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 2>head of someone pouring and filling and</v>
<v Speaker 2>loading,</v>

87
00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 2>but rather they have an anatomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They built out a parts parts,</v>

88
00:05:46.811 --> 00:05:51.811
<v Speaker 2>like two cars to move a means versus end</v>
<v Speaker 2>a let versus four versus cost.</v>
