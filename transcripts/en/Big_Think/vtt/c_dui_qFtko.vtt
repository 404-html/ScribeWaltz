1
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm art.</v>

2
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Learn a loud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a seismologist at the Lamont Doherty</v>

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Earth Observatory of Columbia</v>
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

4
00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm also associate director for the</v>

5
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>division of Seismology Geology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tectonic physics.</v>

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seismology is a study of earthquakes and</v>

7
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>there are two parts of seismology want</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to actually look in detail at the</v>

9
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other is to use the earthquakes</v>

10
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>as a sort of light source for</v>
<v Speaker 1>photographing or imaging the earth</v>

11
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>imaging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The earth is something that we sometimes</v>

12
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>call it structural seismology but very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like a cat scan you might get an a</v>

13
00:00:44.001 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>medical office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use the waves generated by</v>

14
00:00:47.361 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes to aluminate this internal</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of the earth.</v>

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great mysteries of the planet</v>

16
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>is what is your Earth made out of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does that stuff move?</v>

17
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>And seismology is really a remote</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensing tool for us to try to understand</v>

18
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:02.894
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>

20
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>one of the wonderful things that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in the earth sciences over the</v>

21
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>last 40 years is what we call the theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>of plate tectonics.</v>

22
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>And Plate tectonics really is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>descriptive working hypothesis that</v>

23
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>allows us to take diverse sets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>observations and put them together and</v>

24
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>see if we can understand how the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the planet as a whole works.</v>

25
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but plate tectonics really is just a,</v>

26
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.640
<v Speaker 1>a kinematic theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that means is that it really only</v>

27
00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 1>describes the motions of the plates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast they move,</v>

28
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their boundaries look like and so</v>

29
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>but we really don't know how they move</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what forces them to move.</v>

31
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really have to penetrate into the</v>

32
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>interior of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

33
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:52.050
<v Speaker 1>in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth is like a big bubbling pot of</v>

34
00:01:52.051 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>fix soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non geologic time.</v>

35
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>The earth is really a fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course on human time.</v>

36
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You hit a rock with a hammer and my</v>

37
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>crumble and break a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on geologic time,</v>

38
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>the earth really behaves like a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>melted plastic ball.</v>

39
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>it's the movement of that molten</v>
<v Speaker 1>material,</v>

41
00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that plastic,</v>

42
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>that warm plastic material that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives the plates,</v>

43
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>but we can't observe it directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we use earthquakes and,</v>

44
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call structural seismology,</v>

45
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to image it.</v>

46
00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were taking a,</v>

47
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>or if you were interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workings of the human body,</v>

48
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would do would be to take a cat</v>

49
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:36.360
<v Speaker 1>scans or three dimensional images from</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to time to time to get sort of a,</v>

50
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>a movie of how the body works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what we're doing with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seismology.</v>

52
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>We take cat scans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

53
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.223
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

54
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.310
<v Speaker 1>and it gives us some indication of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's going on.</v>

55
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

56
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't do our experiments in geologic</v>

57
00:02:51.931 --> 00:02:53.700
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would just take too long.</v>

58
00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So we use proxies to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us attain kind of a movie.</v>

59
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we sometimes call</v>

60
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>four d seismology.</v>

61
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 40 seismology really means that we're</v>

62
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>looking at the earth in three</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>

63
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>up down north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

65
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.514
<v Speaker 1>east,</v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

66
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>the three physical dimensions of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>real world and sort of getting a time</v>

67
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geologic time occurs over millions of</v>

68
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:23.320
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>

69
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>the lifetime of a single scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can observe that.</v>

71
00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>But over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've developed proxies to replace that.</v>

72
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>And we can use seismology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use petrology,</v>

73
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>the study of rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

74
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>we can look at the ages of rocks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>various ways we can even use</v>

75
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 1>paleontology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the study of fossils to get some</v>

76
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>indication of what the history of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth looks like.</v>

77
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

78
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>incredible thing that has happened is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the three dimensional aspect of</v>

81
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.000
<v Speaker 1>that problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:55.001 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>has really just exploded in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade or so.</v>

83
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>seismic instrumentation used to be pen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and paper,</v>

85
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to have these rotating drums with a</v>

86
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>pen that would wiggle every time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake waves passed for example.</v>

87
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but right now we of course would record</v>

88
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:15.440
<v Speaker 1>that digital and that's like the move</v>
<v Speaker 1>from analog tape to,</v>

89
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>to cds or dvds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>so that's one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one element.</v>

91
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>But the other is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:22.451 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have to wait for an</v>

93
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>earthquake and we didn't have very many</v>
<v Speaker 1>instruments in the ground,</v>

94
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of hundred a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now we can put thousands of</v>

95
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>instruments into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we get a much finer picture,</v>

96
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 1>much more highly resolved picture like</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if you,</v>

97
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.720
<v Speaker 1>we had been shooting through cheesecloth</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a gauze or vaseline or something like</v>

98
00:04:42.791 --> 00:04:43.220
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

99
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've never been able to really see the</v>

100
00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>earth and all its clarity and now we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

101
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're part of a project called Earth</v>

102
00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>scope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

103
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>which is like a giant high resolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>telescope,</v>

104
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>not pointed to the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but pointed down into the earth.</v>

105
00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know less about the earth really than</v>

106
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>we know about the universe at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

107
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this telescope is just giving us</v>

108
00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>fantastic images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're starting off with the North</v>

109
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>American continent and our hope is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the next decades will be doing that</v>

110
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>around the earth as well.</v>

111
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Bell earthquakes are a weird kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon in the following sense.</v>

112
00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about the theory of plate</v>

113
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>tectonics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

114
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.360
<v Speaker 1>the working hypothesis is that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smooth motion of the plates,</v>

115
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the plates move over geologic time</v>

116
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>with predictable rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>it's as if they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.080
<v Speaker 1>kind of a slow movement of traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

119
00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Everybody sort of moving at a rate that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stays constant in time.</v>

120
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 1>But obviously earthquakes happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earthquakes predominantly occur where</v>

121
00:05:47.771 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>the plates interact with one another</v>
<v Speaker 1>along what we call plate boundaries.</v>

122
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

123
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those plate boundaries or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sideways like we have in the San Andreas</v>

124
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>fault or the earthquake that happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haiti.</v>

125
00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those boundaries are</v>

126
00:06:01.431 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>compressional like what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile or what might happen off the coast</v>

127
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>of Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

128
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those boundaries are what we</v>

129
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>call extensional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

130
00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.980
<v Speaker 1>best example of this would be the basin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and range and the western United States,</v>

131
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the longitude of Salt Lake City</v>

132
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>going all the way west to the Sierra.</v>

133
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those three types of boundaries sort</v>

134
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>of describe what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the plates inter interact,</v>

135
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>but earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

136
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>anodic continuous process by any means</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really what we call a stick slip</v>

137
00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:36.560
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while the hypothesis of plate</v>

138
00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>tectonics or the working model is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plates move,</v>

139
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a relatively constant rate at the</v>

140
00:06:43.101 --> 00:06:45.940
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stick and they slip a,</v>

141
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.860
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries don't move at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively constant rate.</v>

142
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Instead the boundaries stick and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stick,</v>

143
00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>the movement of the plates stresses that</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary and eventually that stress</v>

144
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>overcomes the strength of that boundary</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it breaks.</v>

145
00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And that breakage is an earthquake as</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of our,</v>

146
00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>what we call the stick slip model or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have other names for it.</v>

147
00:07:07.431 --> 00:07:09.630
<v Speaker 1>But that's basically what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

148
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>the problem that we face as earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>seismologist is that sticking and</v>

149
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>slipping is almost a chaotic process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite,</v>

150
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:18.530
<v Speaker 1>but almost.</v>

151
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very difficult to predict on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a day to day basis over geologic time.</v>

152
00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very predictable.</v>

153
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>We can get an idea of where the active</v>
<v Speaker 1>plate boundaries are a those plate</v>

154
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:34.760
<v Speaker 1>boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course our major faults in the earth.</v>

155
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>we know where the earthquakes will</v>
<v Speaker 1>occur,</v>

157
00:07:37.851 --> 00:07:42.851
<v Speaker 1>but because we can't predict the stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and slips cycle very well of certainly</v>

158
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:45.070
<v Speaker 1>over human timescales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 1>we can't really get what we call a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction.</v>

160
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a deeper understanding of it</v>

161
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>that that allows us to forecast instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of predict.</v>

162
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 1>And by forecast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

163
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.990
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know where they occur because we know</v>

164
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>where the plate boundaries are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

165
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but we can get a sense of what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of an earthquake might be in</v>

166
00:08:03.981 --> 00:08:05.090
<v Speaker 1>two ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

167
00:08:05.091 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>by looking at the past history and if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have enough earthquakes,</v>

168
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>we can sort of get a statistical model</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

169
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:15.590
<v Speaker 1>of wind and earthquakes might occur and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gives us some probability.</v>

170
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>And the other is to actually do a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward modeling and actually take the</v>

171
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:23.240
<v Speaker 1>plate motions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a model of,</v>

172
00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 1>of the friction along the plate</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundary.</v>

173
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a model of how the stress builds up</v>

174
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:32.870
<v Speaker 1>and sort of predict when and where or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should say forecast when the next</v>

175
00:08:32.871 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 1>earthquake might occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's gotten to the point where we</v>

176
00:08:35.511 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>can probably do that over the span of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>decade or two,</v>

177
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:40.640
<v Speaker 1>perhaps 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

178
00:08:40.641 --> 00:08:42.550
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>sort of provide an actuarial table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go out and buy insurance</v>
<v Speaker 1>in California.</v>

181
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is such an actuarial table to help</v>

182
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you determine what your rates are or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should say a healthy insurance companies</v>

183
00:08:55.741 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>determine what they're going to charge</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

184
00:08:58.050 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And of course we didn't have that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haiti.</v>

185
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had barely had that for Chile.</v>

186
00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the point is we're getting better at</v>

187
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:04.920
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

188
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the exciting parts of earthquake</v>

189
00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>seismology is that the better we get at</v>
<v Speaker 1>forecasting earthquakes,</v>

190
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 1>the closer we might actually come to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction that is useful on human</v>

191
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>timescales.</v>

192
00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.800
<v Speaker 1>Whether an unusual in the sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistically it's unusual.</v>

193
00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say it's just a statistical</v>

194
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>anomalies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical fluke.</v>

195
00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes are occurring any more</v>

196
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>frequently now than they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they occurred last year or 10 years</v>

197
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>ago or 10 years into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to believe that,</v>

198
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.610
<v Speaker 1>and it has nothing to do with global</v>
<v Speaker 1>warming.</v>

199
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a question that we often get.</v>

200
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we learned</v>

201
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 1>seismologists is that earthquakes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred anytime and any place,</v>

202
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:52.530
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even have to occur at plate</v>

203
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:53.910
<v Speaker 1>boundaries for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>

204
00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole other topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

205
00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>but along some of the major plate</v>
<v Speaker 1>boundaries like the Pacific northwest,</v>

206
00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have evidence of pastor earthquakes.</v>

207
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting thing.</v>

208
00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Obviously we didn't have instruments</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back more than about a hundred</v>

209
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.830
<v Speaker 1>years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we don't have an instrumental record,</v>

210
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.510
<v Speaker 1>but we have a record from a newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old newspapers for example,</v>

211
00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>we have a record from some old mission</v>
<v Speaker 1>records,</v>

212
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>particularly in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish mission records and elsewhere</v>

213
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>throughout the western hemisphere.</v>

214
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have very long,</v>

215
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical records and China and Japan</v>

216
00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:34.520
<v Speaker 1>and in parts of Asia where people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been writing things down for quite a few</v>

217
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.870
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

218
00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>but in some places we simply don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that written record and we have to rely</v>

219
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 1>again on proxies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

220
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of things we can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place like California or Seattle,</v>

221
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:47.820
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California first.</v>

222
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing we can do when we have a fault</v>

223
00:10:50.431 --> 00:10:55.080
<v Speaker 1>like the San Andreas is to actually dig</v>
<v Speaker 1>a trench across that fault.</v>

224
00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And when we trench across false like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

225
00:10:58.111 --> 00:11:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trenching it at different places,</v>

226
00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see in the disturbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>soil the record of pastor earthquakes,</v>

227
00:11:06.121 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it may occur every hundred and 50 or 200</v>
<v Speaker 1>or three or 400 years,</v>

228
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with very good carbon dating or</v>

229
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 1>other geological techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

230
00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:16.830
<v Speaker 1>we can get a good sense of what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>history is.</v>

231
00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that trenching at various</v>
<v Speaker 1>places along the fault,</v>

232
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.910
<v Speaker 1>we can even get a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an estimate of the,</v>

233
00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>of the size of the rupture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gives us a way to calculate the</v>

234
00:11:26.791 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>magnitude that then allows us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate the repeat intervals,</v>

235
00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>say for these very large earthquakes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seattle,</v>

236
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:36.720
<v Speaker 1>or I should say more generally off the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coast of,</v>

237
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 1>British Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington and Oregon going down into</v>

239
00:11:40.681 --> 00:11:43.410
<v Speaker 1>northern California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a different kind of a plate</v>

240
00:11:43.411 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 1>boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we call a subduction zone.</v>

241
00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a convergent boundary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates the cascades and the</v>

242
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:49.200
<v Speaker 1>volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:51.630
<v Speaker 1>so we can't trench it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

244
00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.660
<v Speaker 1>but what we can do is look at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of uplift on the coast because</v>

245
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.740
<v Speaker 1>every time an earthquake occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

246
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.590
<v Speaker 1>the upper plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically the coast of</v>

247
00:12:02.591 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>Washington and Oregon and northern</v>
<v Speaker 1>California gets bumped up a little bit.</v>

248
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And by looking at the sediment Terry</v>
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>

249
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.540
<v Speaker 1>actually sometimes it can go down as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

250
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at looking at the cinnamon Terry Record,</v>

251
00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the way,</v>

252
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>say even trees or drowned by encroaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>water or lifted above the water table or</v>

253
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 1>so on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get a sense of the history,</v>

254
00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 1>people who look at things like tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>rings or the history of corals,</v>

256
00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.590
<v Speaker 1>the ornate corals up there now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we go elsewhere around the world,</v>

257
00:12:32.591 --> 00:12:37.591
<v Speaker 1>we see that these are all proxies for</v>
<v Speaker 1>past big earthquakes.</v>

258
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>There's another proxy which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

259
00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 1>in particular for the Pacific Northwest</v>
<v Speaker 1>Works and that is,</v>

260
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes along that boundary have a</v>

261
00:12:47.471 --> 00:12:51.880
<v Speaker 1>tendency to generate a tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it's an Ami,</v>

262
00:12:51.881 --> 00:12:55.450
<v Speaker 1>propagates moot or moves across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean,</v>

263
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>particularly a big one when it hits</v>
<v Speaker 1>islands,</v>

264
00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the Pacific,</v>

265
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:02.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get what's called tsunami deposits.</v>

266
00:13:02.891 --> 00:13:05.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very turbulent phenomenon,</v>

267
00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>brings up pebbles and rocks and disturbs</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beaches and,</v>

268
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can detect some of those.</v>

269
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in particularly for the,</v>

270
00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.780
<v Speaker 1>for the particular case of the Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>

271
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:19.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around 1700,</v>

272
00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>actually in 1700 a tsunami was</v>
<v Speaker 1>generated.</v>

273
00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:28.300
<v Speaker 1>It was recorded in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by looking at the tsunami records in</v>

274
00:13:29.741 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the historical record and the</v>

275
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:37.201
<v Speaker 1>actual geologic record of that tsunami</v>
<v Speaker 1>modelers have been able to kind of back</v>

276
00:13:38.771 --> 00:13:43.630
<v Speaker 1>project that go backwards across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific show that the source of that</v>

277
00:13:43.631 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 1>tsunami was in fact the Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 1>northwest,</v>

278
00:13:45.971 --> 00:13:48.190
<v Speaker 1>and get a good date 1700,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:50.890
<v Speaker 1>for that event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That event looks like to be about a</v>

280
00:13:50.891 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>magnitude nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine and a half.</v>

281
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 1>That's bigger than what we had in Chile</v>
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>

282
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:57.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few weeks ago.</v>

283
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's about as big as the biggest</v>

284
00:14:00.311 --> 00:14:02.350
<v Speaker 1>earthquake we've recorded</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumentally.</v>

285
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.040
<v Speaker 1>So now that we know that that boundary</v>
<v Speaker 1>can support a monstrous earthquake,</v>

286
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:13.210
<v Speaker 1>magnitude nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can go about the job of measuring how</v>

287
00:14:13.211 --> 00:14:16.750
<v Speaker 1>fast the plates are converging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making some assumptions about how stress</v>

288
00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>is building up and come up with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what the repeat interval might</v>

289
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:23.200
<v Speaker 1>be for that earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

290
00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sad to say we're pretty close to the</v>

291
00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>repeat interval for that earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a forecast.</v>

292
00:14:29.111 --> 00:14:30.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not a prediction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a forecast.</v>

293
00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.300
<v Speaker 1>And thankfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the United States going back</v>

294
00:14:34.301 --> 00:14:35.720
<v Speaker 1>a decade or more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.940
<v Speaker 1>seattle and Oregon had been well aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the potential for that earthquake and</v>

296
00:14:39.941 --> 00:14:43.300
<v Speaker 1>they're taking the appropriate steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One would say to try to mitigate the</v>

297
00:14:43.301 --> 00:14:44.230
<v Speaker 1>potential damage.</v>

298
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:48.100
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

299
00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.250
<v Speaker 1>we do talk about things like the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

300
00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:51.810
<v Speaker 1>one in a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:54.140
<v Speaker 1>how big it will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the impact will be.</v>

302
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>A curious thing by the ways that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting better at predicting the</v>

303
00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:01.400
<v Speaker 1>impact of an earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we are actually predicting an</v>

304
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

305
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:03.520
<v Speaker 1>once we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

306
00:15:03.521 --> 00:15:04.354
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

307
00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:06.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once we have a scenario earthquake for</v>

308
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a certain size,</v>

309
00:15:08.421 --> 00:15:12.080
<v Speaker 1>a certain location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our computer modeling really is very</v>

310
00:15:12.081 --> 00:15:14.120
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can actually,</v>

311
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:18.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a computer generate the possible</v>

312
00:15:18.471 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>ground motion from a scenario</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>

313
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 1>We know how buildings interact with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground and what will cause a building to</v>

314
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:29.420
<v Speaker 1>fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We even have a reasonable estimates of</v>

315
00:15:29.421 --> 00:15:32.260
<v Speaker 1>the casualties that might arise and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

316
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 1>the economic damage as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

317
00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:36.710
<v Speaker 1>so we're getting very good at predicting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the damage.</v>

318
00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've constructed such a scenario</v>

319
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:40.430
<v Speaker 1>for California.</v>

320
00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.090
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next few decades,</v>

321
00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 1>30 to 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chance of having a major earthquake</v>

322
00:15:47.631 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>in California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

323
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.490
<v Speaker 1>is pretty close to one pretty close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>unity.</v>

324
00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense it's really safe for a</v>

325
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:58.730
<v Speaker 1>seismologist to say that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes happen,</v>

326
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost certainly a large earthquake is</v>

327
00:16:01.641 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 1>going to happen in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

328
00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:05.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

329
00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sticking my neck out by saying</v>

330
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:08.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a good chance of an earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

331
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but the question is how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it will be and how big it will be</v>

332
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.180
<v Speaker 1>and that we base on trenching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We base on a,</v>

333
00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.160
<v Speaker 1>base it on very fine measurements of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>crust moving.</v>

334
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have better calibrated models of the</v>

335
00:16:21.801 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 1>faults and the frictions on the faults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we're coming up with,</v>

336
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a community understanding of</v>

337
00:16:29.931 --> 00:16:31.730
<v Speaker 1>what the big one might be.</v>

338
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US Geological Survey,</v>

339
00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

340
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>an academic consortium called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern California earthquake center,</v>

341
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:42.010
<v Speaker 1>which actually involves seismologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all over the US,</v>

342
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:43.750
<v Speaker 1>if not the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

343
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.720
<v Speaker 1>I've come together with a consensus</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement that California rupture</v>

344
00:16:47.721 --> 00:16:52.721
<v Speaker 1>forecast as it were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the two areas that are potentially</v>

345
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:58.061
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous are a repeat of a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake along the southern San Andres</v>

346
00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 1>east of Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still close enough to do</v>

347
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 1>considerable damage to Los Angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course in the inland empire east,</v>

348
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically along itn and going down</v>

349
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 1>toward Palm Springs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

350
00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a good chance of significant</v>

351
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:19.541
<v Speaker 1>damage and significant casualties there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second area is up in the East Bay,</v>

352
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:22.280
<v Speaker 1>not a repeat of the 1906 earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is on the,</v>

353
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:23.750
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

354
00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:27.500
<v Speaker 1>the San Francisco peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the East Bay and long something</v>

355
00:17:27.501 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>called the hayward fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really part of the San Andrea system,</v>

356
00:17:30.111 --> 00:17:35.090
<v Speaker 1>but a separate fault that's the fault</v>
<v Speaker 1>that colloquially you may remember sort</v>

357
00:17:35.091 --> 00:17:37.190
<v Speaker 1>of runs right through the Berkeley</v>
<v Speaker 1>football stadium,</v>

358
00:17:37.191 --> 00:17:38.900
<v Speaker 1>the hills above Berkeley and so on.</v>

359
00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.940
<v Speaker 1>cal might have difficulty feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>football team with that earthquake</v>

361
00:17:43.941 --> 00:17:46.370
<v Speaker 1>occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nor predictions of damage there are</v>

362
00:17:46.371 --> 00:17:48.560
<v Speaker 1>pretty severe as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

363
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.453
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

364
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:54.180
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of what might happen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the damage that might</v>

365
00:17:54.181 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

366
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 1>goes a great way to providing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political will.</v>

367
00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.670
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funding to do something about it</v>

368
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:01.710
<v Speaker 1>can't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't stop an earthquake,</v>

369
00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 1>but it can build strong buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can prepare the population and you</v>

370
00:18:05.311 --> 00:18:08.070
<v Speaker 1>can make people aware of what they might</v>
<v Speaker 1>do when they feel an earthquake.</v>

371
00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are other steps we can take as</v>

372
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

373
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't predict,</v>

374
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're getting better at forecasting,</v>

375
00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:20.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's also something interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>called earthquake early warning systems.</v>

376
00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

377
00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has taken a while to develop.</v>

378
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.350
<v Speaker 1>But when you think about it is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

379
00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And when we start with the following</v>
<v Speaker 1>analogy,</v>

380
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:35.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake waves that it in earthquake</v>

381
00:18:35.971 --> 00:18:37.800
<v Speaker 1>occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it generates ground motion.</v>

382
00:18:37.801 --> 00:18:41.550
<v Speaker 1>That ground motion leaves the earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone and the rupture zone in a series of</v>

383
00:18:41.551 --> 00:18:43.920
<v Speaker 1>waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are several types of waves and</v>

384
00:18:43.921 --> 00:18:46.140
<v Speaker 1>the old move at different speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

385
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of our students learned that he's a</v>

386
00:18:48.481 --> 00:18:51.060
<v Speaker 1>primary secondary surface waves and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

387
00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:55.050
<v Speaker 1>And the primary words are very fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secondary waves are slower and the</v>

388
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:58.650
<v Speaker 1>surface waves are slower still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about that,</v>

389
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:02.340
<v Speaker 1>that progression is that the primary or</v>
<v Speaker 1>waves though fast,</v>

390
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:04.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't very large.</v>

391
00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Secondary waves are slower but larger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the surface waves slower,</v>

392
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:13.140
<v Speaker 1>still our largest still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's large ways that do most of</v>

393
00:19:13.141 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 1>the damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the theory is that if you could</v>

394
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 1>detect that little bit of a p wave</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming along,</v>

395
00:19:19.381 --> 00:19:21.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to do a lot of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

396
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:24.840
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might give you enough time ranging from</v>

397
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>a few seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few tens of seconds,</v>

398
00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:28.253
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

399
00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:30.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe even close to a minute or so or</v>

400
00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:31.710
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

401
00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.310
<v Speaker 1>it might give you enough time to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of things that would save people</v>

402
00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:37.410
<v Speaker 1>safe structures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

403
00:19:37.411 --> 00:19:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you could stop trains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could shut off gas,</v>

404
00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:40.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

405
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get people to,</v>

406
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:45.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find safe haven inside the buildings for</v>

407
00:19:45.121 --> 00:19:46.410
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

408
00:19:46.411 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 1>if you could do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would constitute a pretty decent</v>

409
00:19:49.741 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 1>early warning system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so their experiments and trying to</v>

410
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:54.270
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been implemented.</v>

411
00:19:54.271 --> 00:19:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been implemented in Taiwan.</v>

412
00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

413
00:19:58.291 --> 00:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

414
00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:00.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries around trying to,</v>

415
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.460
<v Speaker 1>to investigate these systems.</v>

416
00:20:06.170 --> 00:20:08.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing for an earthquake is</v>

417
00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:10.830
<v Speaker 1>multifaceted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multi dimensional.</v>

418
00:20:10.831 --> 00:20:13.920
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing really is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware.</v>

419
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

420
00:20:15.871 --> 00:20:18.060
<v Speaker 1>I've said that earthquakes and occur</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

421
00:20:18.061 --> 00:20:20.370
<v Speaker 1>but they're more likely some places than</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

422
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:23.970
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic awareness of where your house,</v>

423
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.240
<v Speaker 1>where you work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

424
00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.450
<v Speaker 1>where you are relative to the faults</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might cause an earthquake.</v>

425
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.510
<v Speaker 1>That's a matter of public education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

426
00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.110
<v Speaker 1>but once you know what you're a risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>

427
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make some sort of personal</v>

428
00:20:40.801 --> 00:20:44.430
<v Speaker 1>judgment or if you're a government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of social judgment about the</v>

429
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:47.950
<v Speaker 1>level of risk that you're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept is going to be.</v>

430
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you're willing to accept or only</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to accept a low level of risk,</v>

431
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 1>then there are a number of things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do,</v>

432
00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:59.050
<v Speaker 1>you to ensure that major infrastructure</v>
<v Speaker 1>is resilient,</v>

433
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:04.210
<v Speaker 1>that our water lines are power lines are</v>
<v Speaker 1>built in such a way so that they won't</v>

434
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:07.660
<v Speaker 1>break that bridges and highways one fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

435
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:13.020
<v Speaker 1>That fire stations will remain standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the fire personnel can respond</v>

436
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and that hospitals remain standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

437
00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.690
<v Speaker 1>with respect to individuals in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>

438
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're an earthquake zone,</v>

439
00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:24.340
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that your building is up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

440
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.770
<v Speaker 1>if a code exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

441
00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:31.960
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that you follow that code and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even little things like keeping the</v>

442
00:21:31.961 --> 00:21:33.850
<v Speaker 1>knickknacks away from the edge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf,</v>

443
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.580
<v Speaker 1>keeping your dishes way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the sorts of things that could</v>

444
00:21:36.581 --> 00:21:41.581
<v Speaker 1>make the difference between sort of a Ho</v>
<v Speaker 1>hum boy was that an interesting event to</v>

445
00:21:42.071 --> 00:21:44.570
<v Speaker 1>something that was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

446
00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and these are all written down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to the fema websites,</v>

447
00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:48.090
<v Speaker 1>USG,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s websites.</v>

448
00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.100
<v Speaker 1>There were a whole list of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem arises when first you don't</v>

449
00:21:53.261 --> 00:21:55.640
<v Speaker 1>have building codes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

450
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:59.650
<v Speaker 1>or those codes aren't enforced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a situation in Haiti where you</v>

451
00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:04.651
<v Speaker 1>don't have the national or social wealth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually consider this something you</v>

452
00:22:04.811 --> 00:22:05.590
<v Speaker 1>can do.</v>

453
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the,</v>

454
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.280
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean to bring up Haiti</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>

455
00:22:09.281 --> 00:22:13.720
<v Speaker 1>but the issue there was that there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many sort of day to day problems</v>

456
00:22:13.721 --> 00:22:16.660
<v Speaker 1>facing a Haiti culture in Haiti</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

457
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.170
<v Speaker 1>That's something that might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

458
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.380
<v Speaker 1>really can't get on the radar screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could argue the right or wrong</v>

459
00:22:23.381 --> 00:22:26.290
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that basically is a situation and</v>

460
00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:28.420
<v Speaker 1>sad to say that's tap us throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

461
00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

462
00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:35.470
<v Speaker 1>the basic things really quite easy to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got the money to do them and</v>

463
00:22:35.471 --> 00:22:38.530
<v Speaker 1>if you've got the public awareness to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and if you've got the political</v>

464
00:22:38.531 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 1>will to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with the Commons,</v>

465
00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

466
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.960
<v Speaker 1>where you don't have the political will</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the wealth,</v>

467
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of things that the</v>

468
00:22:50.081 --> 00:22:51.220
<v Speaker 1>community is trying to do.</v>

469
00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:56.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of concentration on</v>
<v Speaker 1>building small scale community awareness</v>

470
00:22:56.231 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 1>so that the awareness of disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awareness of potential disaster I</v>

471
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:02.740
<v Speaker 1>should say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

472
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.830
<v Speaker 1>occurs almost at the household level and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enabling people to make decisions but</v>

473
00:23:08.621 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 1>also giving them sort of the simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they,</v>

474
00:23:11.170 --> 00:23:13.810
<v Speaker 1>that they could do on a day to day</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

475
00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for earthquakes but for floods,</v>

476
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.210
<v Speaker 1>for landslides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

477
00:23:18.211 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>and for that matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for longer term issues like sea level</v>

478
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:22.690
<v Speaker 1>rise and climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

479
00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:23.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

480
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the key things that we're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>at our institute and elsewhere is trying</v>

481
00:23:29.261 --> 00:23:33.550
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring the knowledge we have about</v>

482
00:23:33.551 --> 00:23:36.060
<v Speaker 1>earth processes near.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So dynamic planet.</v>

483
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.380
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We enjoy doing that,</v>

484
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:42.160
<v Speaker 1>but it affects people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we're trying to do</v>

485
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:46.310
<v Speaker 1>is to bring that knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just throw it over the fence so that</v>

486
00:23:46.311 --> 00:23:48.640
<v Speaker 1>policy makers can use it because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

487
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 1>there's none of a feedback and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a system.</v>

488
00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really,</v>

489
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:57.410
<v Speaker 1>scientists need to understand social and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural constraints on using the</v>

490
00:23:57.411 --> 00:24:00.650
<v Speaker 1>information and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the utility of the information that</v>

491
00:24:00.651 --> 00:24:04.070
<v Speaker 1>they provide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I may say,</v>

492
00:24:04.071 --> 00:24:09.071
<v Speaker 1>I think the social scientists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments and ngos need to know what</v>

493
00:24:09.171 --> 00:24:12.140
<v Speaker 1>they don't know and that's a difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>task.</v>

494
00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to be honest,</v>

495
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.680
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting and important thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do and we're getting better at it.</v>

496
00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:24.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'll use a particularly interesting</v>

497
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 1>earthquake from a psychological point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of,</v>

498
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.460
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's very large,</v>

499
00:24:28.461 --> 00:24:30.810
<v Speaker 1>a magnitude 8.8.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

500
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.510
<v Speaker 1>so we would call a great earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we use great in terms of the wow</v>

501
00:24:35.511 --> 00:24:36.530
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

502
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did kill 700 people,</v>

503
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.380
<v Speaker 1>thereabouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It caused billions,</v>

504
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.071
<v Speaker 1>tens of billions of dollars worth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage.</v>

505
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:45.500
<v Speaker 1>So the economic impact in Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to be severe.</v>

506
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't get a magnitude 8.8 very</v>

507
00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason,</v>

508
00:24:51.801 --> 00:24:55.120
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there weren't more casualties and chelay</v>

509
00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 1>and more damage and chill a's that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake was off the coast.</v>

510
00:24:58.521 --> 00:25:02.210
<v Speaker 1>It was in the subduction zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It generates an Ami as we saw.</v>

511
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't a direct hit.</v>

512
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being anywhere close to an 8.8 is</v>

513
00:25:08.031 --> 00:25:10.610
<v Speaker 1>enough of a hit to be dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happened in Chile.</v>

514
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.550
<v Speaker 1>But it was the result of a subduction</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>

515
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:18.610
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what a seismologist call</v>
<v Speaker 1>this certain Pacific seismic belt</v>

516
00:25:19.201 --> 00:25:22.490
<v Speaker 1>earthquake belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what's colloquially known as the</v>

517
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ring of fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

518
00:25:24.201 --> 00:25:29.201
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a great name because</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed the Pacific is rimmed is ringed</v>

519
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.900
<v Speaker 1>by these subduction zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a subduction zone means that the</v>

520
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:38.870
<v Speaker 1>heavier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denser crust of the Pacific Ocean basin</v>

521
00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:44.300
<v Speaker 1>is essentially diving under the lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less dense crust of the continence</v>

522
00:25:44.301 --> 00:25:46.120
<v Speaker 1>surrounding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

523
00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:49.790
<v Speaker 1>and as it dives underneath that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sticks and slips and causes earthquakes.</v>

524
00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly 70 or 80% of the world's biggest</v>

525
00:25:53.931 --> 00:25:55.860
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Pacific Ring of fire,</v>

526
00:25:55.861 --> 00:25:56.301
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

527
00:25:56.301 --> 00:26:00.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a gigantic source of tectonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy of earthquake energy.</v>

528
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other interesting thing about that,</v>

529
00:26:02.421 --> 00:26:03.950
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it's called the ring of</v>

530
00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:06.020
<v Speaker 1>fire is because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

531
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.970
<v Speaker 1>as he's plates dive down underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighter continent pieces of the melt,</v>

532
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:16.510
<v Speaker 1>and that melt becomes magma that just</v>
<v Speaker 1>drives up through what we call the</v>

533
00:26:17.181 --> 00:26:19.280
<v Speaker 1>mantle and the crust and creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>volcanoes.</v>

534
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of part of a,</v>

535
00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:22.443
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

536
00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ecological recycling mechanism going</v>

537
00:26:25.971 --> 00:26:27.470
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're taking old crust,</v>

538
00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:30.050
<v Speaker 1>throwing it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending it down the subduction zone,</v>

539
00:26:30.051 --> 00:26:33.590
<v Speaker 1>recycling it into new material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you throw a paper bag into the</v>

540
00:26:33.591 --> 00:26:36.260
<v Speaker 1>garbage or the recycling bin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

541
00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:39.410
<v Speaker 1>so that's the basics of the tectonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

542
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these earthquakes tend to be very large</v>

543
00:26:41.811 --> 00:26:42.880
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

544
00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

545
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 1>large plates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The continence present a significant</v>

546
00:26:47.341 --> 00:26:50.790
<v Speaker 1>barrier to subduction in many cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

547
00:26:50.791 --> 00:26:53.070
<v Speaker 1>and it takes a long time for stress to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build up.</v>

548
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.520
<v Speaker 1>One interesting thing is that we knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this,</v>

549
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.710
<v Speaker 1>this problem in Chile of course for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

550
00:26:58.711 --> 00:27:02.580
<v Speaker 1>And of course the Chileans who have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily advanced and</v>

551
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:05.790
<v Speaker 1>professional capacity to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes,</v>

552
00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:07.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew about this as well.</v>

553
00:27:07.530 --> 00:27:08.510
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

554
00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.840
<v Speaker 1>20 or 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using very simple components of the</v>

555
00:27:12.841 --> 00:27:14.880
<v Speaker 1>plate tectonic theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:27:14.881 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 1>this particular area was identified as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>so called seismic gap,</v>

557
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:21.930
<v Speaker 1>a place where an earthquake was</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically overdue.</v>

558
00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't predict it,</v>

559
00:27:23.851 --> 00:27:26.700
<v Speaker 1>but we could forecast it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what in some sense,</v>

560
00:27:26.701 --> 00:27:27.534
<v Speaker 1>save Chile.</v>

561
00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large earthquakes do strange things.</v>

562
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

563
00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:38.980
<v Speaker 1>of course what an earthquake does is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

564
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:43.440
<v Speaker 1>in addition to breaking the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually moves big crustal blocks</v>

565
00:27:43.441 --> 00:27:45.120
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when it does that,</v>

566
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:49.110
<v Speaker 1>it shifts the distribution of mass of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>

567
00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

568
00:27:51.270 --> 00:27:55.170
<v Speaker 1>because this wasn't an asteroid or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comet hitting the earth and causing all</v>

569
00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:58.530
<v Speaker 1>these vibrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth has to conserve its angular</v>

570
00:27:58.531 --> 00:28:03.450
<v Speaker 1>momentum and the way the earth conserves</v>
<v Speaker 1>its angular momentum when crustal blocks</v>

571
00:28:03.451 --> 00:28:08.451
<v Speaker 1>shift like that is to change the rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rotation and to slightly shift the axis</v>

572
00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:13.050
<v Speaker 1>of rotation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be calculated,</v>

573
00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but it really isn't measurable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

574
00:28:16.231 --> 00:28:18.990
<v Speaker 1>if you're being paid by the microsecond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's something that you might</v>

575
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 1>worry about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

576
00:28:21.180 --> 00:28:23.820
<v Speaker 1>but the interesting thing is that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculate it.</v>

577
00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:26.730
<v Speaker 1>Not that it is in fact something we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>to worry about</v>

578
00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.320
<v Speaker 1>a hand.</v>

579
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a different kind of an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

580
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pays to think about what's really</v>

581
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:38.970
<v Speaker 1>happening around South America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

582
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 1>the Chilean event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a subduction event,</v>

583
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a seduction of a piece of the</v>

584
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Pacific plate in this case called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazca plate,</v>

585
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.190
<v Speaker 1>but a piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smaller plate going underneath.</v>

586
00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:53.910
<v Speaker 1>I know he Chile underneath the Pacific</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ring of fire.</v>

587
00:28:54.390 --> 00:28:59.130
<v Speaker 1>And so this is a case where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>continent and the Pacific Ocean are</v>

588
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:00.100
<v Speaker 1>sliding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

589
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:03.000
<v Speaker 1>are converging against each other in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific diving down.</v>

590
00:29:03.001 --> 00:29:04.500
<v Speaker 1>Because it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's denser.</v>

591
00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:08.760
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the northern and</v>
<v Speaker 1>southern parts of South America,</v>

592
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:11.130
<v Speaker 1>picture it in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

593
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you've got the Caribbean to the north.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you've got the Scotia seat of</v>

594
00:29:14.091 --> 00:29:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the south between South America and aunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>artica.</v>

595
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And those are two very interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>plates.</v>

596
00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

597
00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:26.181
<v Speaker 1>in some sense he can think about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>plates as resulting from the squirt of</v>

598
00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:30.900
<v Speaker 1>material in geologic time going around</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America.</v>

599
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.530
<v Speaker 1>So if you can't sub duct this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get everything underneath</v>

600
00:29:34.531 --> 00:29:38.790
<v Speaker 1>South America through subduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff has to go someplace and it</v>

601
00:29:38.791 --> 00:29:41.290
<v Speaker 1>goes north and south and sort of squirts</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

602
00:29:41.291 --> 00:29:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And the Caribbean plate is one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>plates.</v>

603
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:47.740
<v Speaker 1>I've got squirted through the gap</v>
<v Speaker 1>between North and South America.</v>

604
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it's,</v>

605
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a vast simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually the way we,</v>

606
00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.060
<v Speaker 1>we teach it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a fun thing to think about.</v>

607
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so that the Caribbean is actually</v>

608
00:29:58.001 --> 00:30:00.210
<v Speaker 1>itself a small plate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

609
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:02.080
<v Speaker 1>it is a significant part of plate</v>
<v Speaker 1>tectonics.</v>

610
00:30:02.081 --> 00:30:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It was will recognize as a plate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

611
00:30:04.571 --> 00:30:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but it's been basically squirting past</v>
<v Speaker 1>South America between North and South</v>

612
00:30:09.461 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going from west to east and it's moving</v>

613
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:17.950
<v Speaker 1>at a little less than an inch a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>relative to North America.</v>

614
00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unfortunate thing for Haiti is that</v>

615
00:30:22.751 --> 00:30:27.070
<v Speaker 1>for geologic reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haiti lies along the northern boundary.</v>

616
00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And because this is a squirt boundary</v>
<v Speaker 1>going from west to east,</v>

617
00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is what we call a strike slip</v>

618
00:30:33.401 --> 00:30:35.560
<v Speaker 1>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fault that moves sideways.</v>

619
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 1>There's some complexities to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that fault was also recognized as</v>

620
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 1>being capable of supporting a magnitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven or greater earthquake.</v>

621
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Actually 7.2,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

622
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:48.820
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that forecast was made in the</v>

623
00:30:48.821 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 1>professional literature in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years ago.</v>

624
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

625
00:30:54.461 --> 00:30:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and we've known for about 20 years at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fault was dangerous anyway.</v>

626
00:30:57.851 --> 00:31:00.550
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't a subduction earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a sliding earthquake and</v>

627
00:31:00.551 --> 00:31:04.450
<v Speaker 1>sliding earthquakes strikes slipper</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes or dangerous also for a</v>

628
00:31:04.451 --> 00:31:06.160
<v Speaker 1>number of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

629
00:31:06.161 --> 00:31:09.560
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend not to be as large as a</v>

630
00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.190
<v Speaker 1>subduction earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it can be large enough.</v>

631
00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:13.571
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also,</v>

632
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.290
<v Speaker 1>in this particular case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they occurred on land and unfortunately</v>

633
00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:19.900
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost a direct hit on</v>

634
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.753
<v Speaker 1>port-au-prince.</v>

635
00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.220
<v Speaker 1>The earthquake itself was shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which increases the amount of vibration</v>

636
00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:29.470
<v Speaker 1>that people on the surface feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

637
00:31:29.471 --> 00:31:32.410
<v Speaker 1>and it was very close to major</v>
<v Speaker 1>population centers.</v>

638
00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:35.980
<v Speaker 1>So if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of the perfect storm of bad</v>

639
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:37.930
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

640
00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.890
<v Speaker 1>even if Chile had good building codes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good construction,</v>

641
00:31:41.891 --> 00:31:44.920
<v Speaker 1>I think we would have seen tens of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of casualties anyway,</v>

642
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.860
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to deal with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake of that sort,</v>

643
00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:49.900
<v Speaker 1>but it was a different kind of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal.</v>

644
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've looked at the Chilean earthquake</v>

645
00:31:52.661 --> 00:31:54.940
<v Speaker 1>in many ways and we continue to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

646
00:31:54.941 --> 00:31:57.820
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of conferences coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the next few days,</v>

647
00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:01.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to move to the next phase of</v>

648
00:32:01.031 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Chili rebuilding and sort of essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the,</v>

649
00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:06.370
<v Speaker 1>the rebuilding of Chili more risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious,</v>

650
00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:09.630
<v Speaker 1>not just for earthquakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the storm's coming up and the</v>

651
00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:12.640
<v Speaker 1>annual storm season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the annual hurricane season and</v>

652
00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:17.170
<v Speaker 1>concomitant landslides and other natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>hazards.</v>

653
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

654
00:32:20.231 --> 00:32:23.880
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

655
00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.590
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes on land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these strikes of earthquakes,</v>

656
00:32:26.591 --> 00:32:29.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

657
00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:35.250
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about in Haiti is that this</v>

658
00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:40.890
<v Speaker 1>earthquake may have stressed parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fault that did not rupture on</v>

659
00:32:42.171 --> 00:32:44.570
<v Speaker 1>January 12th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

660
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a,</v>

661
00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:48.140
<v Speaker 1>when an earthquake happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't zip open the whole fault and</v>

662
00:32:48.141 --> 00:32:52.130
<v Speaker 1>only sips open this case about a 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometer segment of it.</v>

663
00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's still stuff on each side</v>
<v Speaker 1>that did not rupture well,</v>

664
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:59.510
<v Speaker 1>that stuff may have been overstressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That piece of the fault may have been</v>

665
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:03.140
<v Speaker 1>overstressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the potential for an earthquake</v>

666
00:33:03.170 --> 00:33:06.230
<v Speaker 1>on those segments may actually have</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased.</v>

667
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.300
<v Speaker 1>That again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a computer model.</v>

668
00:33:08.301 --> 00:33:10.740
<v Speaker 1>It's something that we're working on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

669
00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:13.210
<v Speaker 1>it is hard to predict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

670
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but it is something that as a forecast</v>
<v Speaker 1>ought to play into the way Haiti's being</v>

671
00:33:19.491 --> 00:33:21.620
<v Speaker 1>rebuilt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

672
00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:23.720
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do the same thing,</v>

673
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.580
<v Speaker 1>but to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

674
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from the economic damage and the</v>

675
00:33:28.371 --> 00:33:31.160
<v Speaker 1>economic recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile has a,</v>

676
00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:35.630
<v Speaker 1>a good capacity to deal with future</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes and the outcomes of this</v>

677
00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.400
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With Haiti.</v>

678
00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the international community</v>

679
00:33:40.851 --> 00:33:44.570
<v Speaker 1>will work with the Haitians to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>that capacity so that they can monitor</v>

680
00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.030
<v Speaker 1>the potential for these future</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes.</v>

681
00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:51.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

682
00:33:51.591 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 1>obviously the public has a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in earthquake happens and so we</v>

683
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:56.450
<v Speaker 1>do our best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>best we can.</v>

684
00:33:56.820 --> 00:33:59.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions tend to be repetitive.</v>

685
00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always we get a question from</v>

686
00:34:02.061 --> 00:34:05.990
<v Speaker 1>somebody about whether they can come see</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Richter scale.</v>

687
00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Do we have an example of the Richter</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale?</v>

688
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Richter scale is a mathematical</v>

689
00:34:10.221 --> 00:34:11.410
<v Speaker 1>calculation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

690
00:34:11.450 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 1>psychologists don't use it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason we give a rector of</v>

691
00:34:14.061 --> 00:34:15.650
<v Speaker 1>magnitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

692
00:34:15.651 --> 00:34:18.170
<v Speaker 1>is for the press and the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have much better ways of</v>

693
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.760
<v Speaker 1>measuring the energy of an earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

694
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:22.700
<v Speaker 1>But the second question that's cropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and,</v>

695
00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:25.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating in its own right,</v>

696
00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.980
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

697
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:29.630
<v Speaker 1>the first time I heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was a fluke,</v>

698
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:32.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard it so many times since</v>

699
00:34:32.511 --> 00:34:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Haiti that I wonder what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>

700
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.420
<v Speaker 1>are these earthquakes related to global</v>
<v Speaker 1>warming?</v>

701
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious about that.</v>

702
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:45.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that most of the press and most</v>

703
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 1>of the public that have called in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that didn't have specific domain</v>

704
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:50.510
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

705
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:52.970
<v Speaker 1>has asked us that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

706
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.340
<v Speaker 1>we also get questions whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

707
00:34:55.450 --> 00:34:57.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 is coming a couple of years early.</v>

708
00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get that sort of thing.</v>

709
00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:02.990
<v Speaker 1>It's just the end of days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it speaks to something more</v>

710
00:35:02.991 --> 00:35:05.030
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

711
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquakes and major disasters,</v>

712
00:35:09.210 --> 00:35:12.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a certain impact on the public</v>

713
00:35:12.681 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think earthquakes more so,</v>

714
00:35:15.351 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 1>or even volcanic eruptions more so than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anything else.</v>

715
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:19.671
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

716
00:35:19.671 --> 00:35:22.280
<v Speaker 1>we get a major hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few major hurricanes every year.</v>

717
00:35:22.281 --> 00:35:24.630
<v Speaker 1>We get floods every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

718
00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.190
<v Speaker 1>their major disasters that cause more</v>
<v Speaker 1>norms,</v>

719
00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:29.210
<v Speaker 1>norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of economic damage and</v>

720
00:35:29.211 --> 00:35:31.200
<v Speaker 1>casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

721
00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:35.510
<v Speaker 1>but yet we hear about them relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

722
00:35:35.511 --> 00:35:38.670
<v Speaker 1>And so we kind of think of that as kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of background.</v>

723
00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.760
<v Speaker 1>This is what the earth is doing to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But earthquakes,</v>

724
00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 1>especially major ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are relatively rare.</v>

725
00:35:43.771 --> 00:35:46.900
<v Speaker 1>We get a few major ones that decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

726
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:51.810
<v Speaker 1>particularly ones with huge numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties and the concept of an</v>

727
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:54.420
<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it shakes the firmament,</v>

728
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

729
00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:59.910
<v Speaker 1>that it removes your footing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it could destroy everything in a</v>

730
00:35:59.911 --> 00:36:02.580
<v Speaker 1>blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it is unpredictable,</v>

731
00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 1>that it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

732
00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:09.330
<v Speaker 1>even if you're rational in a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

733
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're a rational and even a</v>

734
00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:14.850
<v Speaker 1>theological sort of way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to,</v>

735
00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it has to have some impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

736
00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:19.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

737
00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.060
<v Speaker 1>the response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific response to the Chilean</v>

738
00:36:22.061 --> 00:36:24.110
<v Speaker 1>earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the modulator,</v>

739
00:36:24.111 --> 00:36:29.111
<v Speaker 1>it a bit by the damage and by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>casualties still was this is a major</v>

740
00:36:29.821 --> 00:36:32.130
<v Speaker 1>earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got to look at this as well as we</v>

741
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:34.500
<v Speaker 1>can because we only get a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shots of decades.</v>

742
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now there are teams of scientists and</v>

743
00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 1>lots of instrumentation going to Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

744
00:36:41.641 --> 00:36:45.120
<v Speaker 1>but when you get down to Haiti or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like Haiti,</v>

745
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:48.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get a directed on a capital</v>

746
00:36:48.151 --> 00:36:53.151
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the bulk of the nation is affected,</v>

747
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.920
<v Speaker 1>where you have damaged that far exceeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

748
00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.710
<v Speaker 1>their economic ability to come back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

749
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.560
<v Speaker 1>coupled with the fact that an earthquake</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally moves the ground on which you</v>

750
00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:11.400
<v Speaker 1>cited a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start asking basic questions like,</v>

751
00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:13.770
<v Speaker 1>should I even be here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should I be living here?</v>

752
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Do I have to move?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is,</v>

753
00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 1>what is the future of my country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the future of my city?</v>

754
00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:24.090
<v Speaker 1>And those are the sorts of questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think have such a big impact on</v>

755
00:37:24.091 --> 00:37:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the public that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

756
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 1>by necessity I think we've got to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about them.</v>

757
00:37:29.820 --> 00:37:31.380
<v Speaker 1>We've got to talk about what it means.</v>

758
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I think science is somewhat ill equipped</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

759
00:37:34.650 --> 00:37:36.630
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we quantify everything.</v>

760
00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:40.320
<v Speaker 1>We enumerate the energies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the displacements,</v>

761
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:43.140
<v Speaker 1>the ground motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

762
00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:44.650
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

763
00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:50.010
<v Speaker 1>we have technology and we have lingo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of this relates to somebody</v>

764
00:37:50.011 --> 00:37:52.410
<v Speaker 1>who's asking the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

765
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:54.960
<v Speaker 1>my house was destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where should I move?</v>

766
00:37:55.770 --> 00:37:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it relates of course in a very</v>

767
00:37:58.201 --> 00:37:59.430
<v Speaker 1>quantitative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific way.</v>

768
00:37:59.431 --> 00:38:01.260
<v Speaker 1>But how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you approach that person?</v>

769
00:38:01.261 --> 00:38:06.261
<v Speaker 1>How do you assure them that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation has a rational response?</v>

770
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think we have a good way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with that.</v>

771
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:14.310
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the questions we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting and a lot of the,</v>

772
00:38:14.311 --> 00:38:16.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinking that generated,</v>

773
00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to do with these central questions</v>

774
00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:24.270
<v Speaker 1>of what does this mean in particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the future of Haiti?</v>

775
00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 1>But what does this mean when we talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about taking steps to mitigate against</v>

776
00:38:29.071 --> 00:38:30.840
<v Speaker 1>future tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>future disasters,</v>

777
00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.300
<v Speaker 1>not just for earthquakes.</v>

778
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So for the other major natural disasters</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

779
00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that,</v>

780
00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:39.820
<v Speaker 1>and too many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

781
00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that we haven't thought about</v>

782
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:46.300
<v Speaker 1>this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me to be an area,</v>

783
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.360
<v Speaker 1>not just of research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of so sort of a way to link directly</v>

784
00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:57.550
<v Speaker 1>to the public directly to the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to understand what it is we're</v>

785
00:38:57.551 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 1>doing as scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

786
00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:01.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

787
00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I could make the same sort of arguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about climate change for example,</v>

788
00:39:04.271 --> 00:39:05.170
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

789
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:09.100
<v Speaker 1>earthquake serve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a phrase,</v>

790
00:39:09.101 --> 00:39:11.410
<v Speaker 1>and I don't mean to use it lightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

791
00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake service training days for the</v>

792
00:39:14.531 --> 00:39:18.970
<v Speaker 1>major environmental disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>major environmental stresses that our</v>

793
00:39:18.971 --> 00:39:23.620
<v Speaker 1>planet faces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we can begin to address how we</v>

794
00:39:23.621 --> 00:39:26.470
<v Speaker 1>relate to the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we provide assurance,</v>

795
00:39:27.070 --> 00:39:28.740
<v Speaker 1>how we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

796
00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:31.990
<v Speaker 1>help the public to understand what it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happening in them.</v>

797
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:36.990
<v Speaker 1>If we can understand how to do that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>major earthquakes or major hurricanes a,</v>

798
00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:41.140
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps we can do something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that's even more merger,</v>

799
00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.380
<v Speaker 1>the major more in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more emergent,</v>

800
00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more probabilistic,</v>

801
00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we actually might have a chance in</v>

802
00:39:50.351 --> 00:39:52.420
<v Speaker 1>modifying our behavior to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

803
00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.860
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I've taken away from this</v>

804
00:39:56.861 --> 00:40:01.070
<v Speaker 1>interaction from Haiti and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Chile and I must've been,</v>

805
00:40:01.071 --> 00:40:04.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not new to this earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had it before with the Indonesian</v>

806
00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.170
<v Speaker 1>earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

807
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.190
<v Speaker 1>we've seen it in earthquakes going as</v>
<v Speaker 1>far back as the 80s and the 70s,</v>

808
00:40:12.191 --> 00:40:15.040
<v Speaker 1>and places like Armenia and China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>

809
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.570
<v Speaker 1>But what we've taken away from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

810
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.590
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a conversation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists have to have with the public</v>

811
00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.610
<v Speaker 1>that the public will regard as deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful,</v>

812
00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.810
<v Speaker 1>which means we can't just throw our</v>
<v Speaker 1>results over the fence.</v>

813
00:40:31.811 --> 00:40:35.050
<v Speaker 1>We can't just stick with our technical</v>
<v Speaker 1>journals.</v>

814
00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.560
<v Speaker 1>There's gotta be some other mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

815
00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.670
<v Speaker 1>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think universities where,</v>

816
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ascribed to liberal thinking,</v>

817
00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.000
<v Speaker 1>the small l liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

818
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ought to better,</v>

819
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:52.480
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a good place to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

820
00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:55.060
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the universities have that kind</v>

821
00:40:55.061 --> 00:40:59.170
<v Speaker 1>of role to play beyond the roles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments and other social</v>

822
00:40:59.171 --> 00:41:00.130
<v Speaker 1>institutions play.</v>

823
00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

824
00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the rarest seismologists as hasn't</v>

825
00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.510
<v Speaker 1>experienced an earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call them theoreticians,</v>

826
00:41:10.511 --> 00:41:12.100
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

827
00:41:12.130 --> 00:41:12.581
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

828
00:41:12.581 --> 00:41:14.110
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've experienced earthquakes,</v>

829
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing larger than about a magnitude</v>

830
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:17.620
<v Speaker 1>six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

831
00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and of course I've been an aftershock</v>
<v Speaker 1>zones where magnitude fours and fives</v>

832
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:22.810
<v Speaker 1>are fairly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly frequent,</v>

833
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you take steps to deal with it.</v>

834
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very difficult for me to</v>

835
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:32.470
<v Speaker 1>imagine what it would be like in an 8.8.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

836
00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:35.090
<v Speaker 1>or even a 7.0,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a direct hit.</v>

837
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally feel fortunate that I</v>

838
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 1>haven't been in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I sometimes joke with my colleagues,</v>

839
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 1>that's why I work in New York and not in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

840
00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:47.180
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

841
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand earthquakes in the</v>

842
00:41:51.381 --> 00:41:56.381
<v Speaker 1>abstract and the visceral feel of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>earthquake is something that perhaps</v>

843
00:41:57.050 --> 00:42:01.100
<v Speaker 1>might contribute to the conversation we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to have with the public.</v>

844
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:05.750
<v Speaker 1>And maybe there ought to be a program to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a lot of seismologists into</v>

845
00:42:05.751 --> 00:42:08.090
<v Speaker 1>earthquake zones that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it's like.</v>

846
00:42:08.091 --> 00:42:10.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm only half of specious there.</v>

847
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to experience an earthquake is to</v>

848
00:42:14.091 --> 00:42:17.600
<v Speaker 1>know what it means to somebody who may</v>
<v Speaker 1>not be a seismologist,</v>

849
00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.060
<v Speaker 1>who has a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has just been destroyed,</v>

850
00:42:20.510 --> 00:42:23.060
<v Speaker 1>who has a livelihood that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared,</v>

851
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and has a government that's in shambles.</v>

852
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:27.850
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

853
00:42:28.070 --> 00:42:31.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe all we can do is extrapolate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's,</v>

854
00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:33.440
<v Speaker 1>it's something necessary to think about.</v>
