00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that the growth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonprofits and specifically</v>

3
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>environmental nonprofits has diluted</v>
<v Speaker 1>surfrider foundation at all in that back</v>

4
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>to I love having more help anywhere we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can get it.</v>

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>The more the merrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

6
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>I think what is changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned a while ago was a w was</v>

7
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:31.521
<v Speaker 1>everything that happened in the 90s all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology we can now in about 14</v>

8
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>hours send 10,000 emails to government</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger on an issue.</v>

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 1>We can send 20,000 emails to people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile.</v>

10
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean we can tap people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk face to face all over the</v>

11
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>world using skype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do.</v>

12
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are radically shifting the</v>

13
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>toolset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capabilities and the power that is</v>

14
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>at the edge of the network of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

15
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>So all of a sudden you don't have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rupert Murdoch Buying The Wall Street</v>

16
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Journal to have your hand on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>joystick.</v>

17
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>You can be 10,000 people in Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do this a lot of different ways</v>

18
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>as long as you understand and implement</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

19
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:13.311
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite things that just came</v>
<v Speaker 1>out was a $99 video player that records</v>

20
00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:18.441
<v Speaker 1>on flash the size of a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave them away as freebies at this</v>

21
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>conference that I'm at right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

22
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>very powerful tool.</v>

23
00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think something has shifted in the</v>

24
00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 1>last 12 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is radically different than it was</v>

25
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It used to be that business was bad,</v>

26
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>government was slow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ngo Dash virus.</v>

27
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are where all the smart people</v>

28
00:01:45.781 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera in anything with a corporate</v>

29
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>brand was essentially bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what has happened in the last 12</v>

30
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:54.630
<v Speaker 1>months is that governments are still</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow.</v>

31
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>I think they'll always be slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business has flipped from one of their</v>

32
00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:01.170
<v Speaker 1>emotions to the other emotion and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>only have two emotions.</v>

33
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>And the one emotion that they were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fear.</v>

34
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 1>They didn't understand the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't understand the cost of all</v>

35
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they do now.</v>

36
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>So you have Jim Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO of Duke Energy,</v>

37
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>amazing guy making amazing statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart is making amazing strides to</v>

38
00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>dupont making amazing strides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now they flipped over to their other</v>

39
00:02:22.111 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>convenient emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is greed.</v>

40
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Business has the capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the reach,</v>

41
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>they have the infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the,</v>

42
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution channel to consumers.</v>

43
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Business will drive the green movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also what Thomas Friedman saying,</v>

44
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 1>and a new kind of green is the new red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>white and blue people are saying green</v>

45
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>was the new gold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

46
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's not as simple as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Businesses are cashing in.</v>

47
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not the message at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Businesses will cash in regardless.</v>

48
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.950
<v Speaker 1>The point is that the globe is in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis mode.</v>

49
00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>It's red lining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

50
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>and businesses cannot sustain their</v>
<v Speaker 1>model unless adapt.</v>

51
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And they are much quicker to adapt than</v>
<v Speaker 1>a government,</v>

52
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>which we're seeing all over the world.</v>
