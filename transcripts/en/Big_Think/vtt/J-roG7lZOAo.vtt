00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.150
<v Speaker 1>I think of what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Today or just recently on fit with</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook where they've,</v>

3
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed a way to capitalize on the</v>

4
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 2>fact that people are sharing information</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you know,</v>

5
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 2>50 million people and other people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are of a like mind and they're going to</v>

6
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 2>attach at advertising to these messages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think you have to be really</v>

7
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:34.581
<v Speaker 2>careful that the advertising doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>become so intrusive that it,</v>

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's greeted in a hostile environment.</v>

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 2>I remember many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the 10 or 15 years ago,</v>

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 2>there was an idea to put advertising on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

12
00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 2>on the runways where the baggage was</v>
<v Speaker 2>being the baggage runways and airports</v>

13
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 2>so that while you were standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

14
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 2>wondering if your baggage was actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to come through the door.</v>

15
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 2>You could be looking at advertising on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

16
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 2>on the rubber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the rubber strips.</v>

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if that was ever done.</v>

18
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if it was some APP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some airports may have actually done</v>

19
00:01:06.301 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was an interesting idea to try</v>

20
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 2>and sell somebody something while they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were bored or,</v>

21
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.880
<v Speaker 2>or terrified that they'll love luggage</v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't going to show up.</v>

22
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that that was ever done in</v>
<v Speaker 2>great numbers.</v>

23
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 2>I certainly don't remember seeing it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the travels I've done.</v>

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 2>But you have to be careful when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>surround the consumer with advertising</v>

25
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 2>messaging that you don't irritate them</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the process.</v>

26
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 2>And that means that you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>entertaining,</v>

27
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you have to make them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be appealing,</v>

28
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to make them want to watch what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>

29
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 2>your messaging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be a craftsman.</v>

30
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of the user generated</v>
<v Speaker 2>advertising might be interesting now and</v>

31
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fun to think about it and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of it is actually pretty good.</v>

32
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.710
<v Speaker 2>I think it's still an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Advertising and the creative end of</v>

33
00:01:49.711 --> 00:01:54.711
<v Speaker 2>advertising is still needs art artists</v>
<v Speaker 2>and craftsmen and people who are good at</v>

34
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:59.991
<v Speaker 2>storytelling and creating imagery and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making things beautiful and interesting</v>

35
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.370
<v Speaker 2>to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know that uh,</v>

36
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 2>the user generated commercials are going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take over there.</v>

37
00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of interesting now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like them.</v>

38
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always,</v>

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 2>it's like a mosaic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

40
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a place for everything.</v>
