00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how else to describe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the joy is seeing it finished.</v>

2
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.080
<v Speaker 1>The joy is seeing people using the</v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

3
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>seeing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying being there,</v>

4
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>seeing their response to the uniqueness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the place.</v>

5
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.890
<v Speaker 1>We have many projects here that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>

6
00:00:32.891 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Drawings had beautiful models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not realize,</v>

7
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>and for me that's the saddest thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the joy is the realization</v>

8
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>struggle is getting it realized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The struggle was dealing with a myriad</v>

9
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>of people that sometimes come and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the building process.</v>

10
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>I've been involved in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many projects were the only person who's</v>

11
00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>there from the beginning to the end is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the architect of the people who have</v>

12
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>prominent positions in decisions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are made aren't there to see what those</v>

13
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>decisions cause and how they affect what</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fine.</v>

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.290
