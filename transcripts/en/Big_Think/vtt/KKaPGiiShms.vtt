1
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a big question,</v>

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

3
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>if anybody's seen the movie minority</v>
<v Speaker 1>report where people are arrested for</v>

4
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>crimes before they actually commit them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because the data suggests they're</v>

5
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 1>going to commit a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.140
<v Speaker 1>are we entering this world with so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>data available?</v>

7
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are definitely our clues on the</v>

8
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Internet that people are considering</v>
<v Speaker 1>committing a crime.</v>

9
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people really do tie how to kill your</v>

10
00:00:30.131 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend on Google or a how to commit</v>
<v Speaker 1>a murder.</v>

11
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

12
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>so what should we do with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>information as a society?</v>

13
00:00:39.161 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really careful.</v>

14
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's uh,</v>

15
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>an ethical and privacy reasons to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful as a society.</v>

16
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>It's not supposed to be illegal to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad thoughts,</v>

17
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's also a data science</v>

18
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>reason for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that you do see in</v>

19
00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:58.261
<v Speaker 1>this data is that a lot of people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific thoughts or make horrific</v>

20
00:00:58.511 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>searches without ever going through with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a horrific action.</v>

21
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it may be that when we have all this</v>

22
00:01:03.941 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we're going to be able to</v>

23
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.070
<v Speaker 1>figure out like exactly who's at risk of</v>
<v Speaker 1>committing a crime or doing something</v>

24
00:01:09.071 --> 00:01:10.900
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it may be that it's just really,</v>

25
00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>really hard because a huge percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people look really,</v>

26
00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>really bad on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>but never go through with the action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a study of prosper,</v>

28
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>a peer to peer lending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.291
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:28.291
<v Speaker 1>so people can apply for loans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>scholars analyzed the loan application,</v>

31
00:01:29.891 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>what people wrote in their loan</v>
<v Speaker 1>application and whether they paid back</v>

32
00:01:32.831 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>their loan and they found that you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict whether someone will pay back</v>

33
00:01:37.541 --> 00:01:42.070
<v Speaker 1>the loan based on the words that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>used in their loan application.</v>

34
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>So if a person uses the phrase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise they're are much less likely</v>

35
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>to pay back a loan because I guess</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody lies.</v>

36
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>So I promise is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a clue that you're not going to pay</v>

37
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>back the loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them,</v>

38
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.870
<v Speaker 1>one of the more striking indicators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the single highest indicators</v>

39
00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:02.500
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pay back a loan is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you use the word God in your loan</v>

40
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:04.450
<v Speaker 1>application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is kind of a little bit eerie</v>
<v Speaker 1>and suggest a potentially dark future.</v>

42
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:13.540
<v Speaker 1>It means that someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lender would be wise to not give a</v>

43
00:02:13.541 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>loan to anybody who mentions God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone says,</v>

44
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>God bless you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>in a loan application,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are put together in a large group</v>

46
00:02:21.671 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>of other people who tend on average not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay back their loans.</v>

47
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.980
<v Speaker 1>So there's real danger to some of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>big data where a lot of the correlation,</v>

48
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>everything kind of correlates with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else.</v>

49
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes for reasons that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand some words people use</v>

50
00:02:37.421 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 1>or likes they have on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>predict that they're going to do bad</v>

51
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:44.680
<v Speaker 1>things even if they're not really going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do bad things.</v>

52
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 1>And they may be punished without even</v>
<v Speaker 1>realizing why.</v>

53
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing you see in the Google search</v>

54
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:53.590
<v Speaker 1>data related to religion is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions people have and they're</v>

55
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>usually concentrated in the Bible belt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

56
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>but people have kind of loaded about</v>
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

57
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>So why does God allow bad things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to good people are,</v>

58
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>why does God allow suffering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or why does God needs so much praise?</v>

59
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are questions that people might</v>

60
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>not raise a loud because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to share their doubts</v>

62
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>with others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they turn to Google and ask them</v>

63
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really loaded questions about the</v>

64
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:25.660
<v Speaker 1>stories that they hear a related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
