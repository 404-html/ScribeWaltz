1
00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I can ask you about the question up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a lot and the question is,</v>

2
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>will we have a limited amount of oil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do have limited amount of oil.</v>

4
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>We have a limited amount of television</v>
<v Speaker 1>cameras and a Rolex watches and uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>light bulbs and you name it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

6
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a finite number of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My response to the peak oil,</v>

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments are,</v>

8
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to hit a peak oil production</v>

10
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>at some point in the future when that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

11
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 1>no one can predict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is that as the price of</v>

12
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:40.010
<v Speaker 1>oil rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs,</v>

13
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>innovators are going to come up with new</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to find oil and get it out of the</v>

14
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>ground and further that the issue as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

15
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>as that price rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>demand has to stay in balance with</v>

16
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>supply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't have more demand than supply</v>

17
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>the price.</v>

18
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Eventually we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll crush demand at a certain point</v>

19
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will stay in balance.</v>

20
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>The good news for the u s which I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>people may not say it's good news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can afford higher oil prices more</v>

22
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 1>easily than can't say Pakistan or India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are,</v>

23
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>we're wealthier country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have more disposable income.</v>

24
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we are going to see as,</v>

25
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>as oil or natural gas or any commodity</v>
<v Speaker 1>becomes more expensive.</v>

26
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Rolex watches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are rationed by price.</v>

27
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have rationing by price.</v>

28
00:01:26.091 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Today on virtually every commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone can eat at 21 club.</v>

29
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:33.260
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone wears a rolex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is rationed by price.</v>

30
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.310
<v Speaker 1>As energy prices rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will see more pronounced rationing by</v>

31
00:01:37.311 --> 00:01:38.870
<v Speaker 1>price of energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>commodities.</v>

32
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that as the price</v>

33
00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>rises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see more innovation and more</v>

34
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:46.640
<v Speaker 1>alternatives come into the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that may be,</v>

35
00:01:46.641 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 1>whether it's batteries in cars or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other liquid fuel,</v>

37
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not ethanol,</v>

38
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may come into the market.</v>

39
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
