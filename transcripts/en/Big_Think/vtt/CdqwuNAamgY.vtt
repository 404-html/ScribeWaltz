1
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>What's so much of what happens in</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

2
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 1>it's about somehow not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgress on the interest of adults.</v>

3
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:21.710
<v Speaker 1>from a symbolic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 1>in order to ensure that everybody knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

6
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>that everybody has skin in the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.680
<v Speaker 1>many of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the schools that we chose to</v>

9
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>close had been really toxic environments</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of,</v>

10
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>of their outcomes for kids over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.060
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to us that if we were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create settings that we're going to work</v>

13
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>for kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>in a transformational way over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We needed to,</v>

15
00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.980
<v Speaker 1>we needed to give people a chance in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

16
00:00:56.981 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>in terms of starting new new communities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and settings that,</v>

17
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>had truly different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>we chose to close schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unexplored in early hard endeavor</v>

21
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.373
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every superintendent who tries this,</v>

24
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately learns is that it doesn't</v>

25
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>matter how bad our school is.</v>

26
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the community doesn't want to close.</v>

27
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have schools where,</v>

28
00:01:27.891 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25% of the kids are performing a</v>

29
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>proficient and events or were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>30% of the kids have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have graduated.</v>

31
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.050
<v Speaker 1>And you have people coming to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

32
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

33
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:41.780
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not about the schools,</v>

34
00:01:41.781 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>it's about the school not getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

35
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also a sense in neighborhoods,</v>

36
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>schools are very much part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of neighborhoods.</v>

37
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.373
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>anybody who there's two closest school</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way is,</v>

39
00:01:57.981 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is violating,</v>

40
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a story arc for that neighborhood.</v>

42
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

43
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduated from that school.</v>

44
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>quite often you have teachers who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who attended the school.</v>

46
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's always this,</v>

47
00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>this the sense that that the central</v>
<v Speaker 1>office has not done its job.</v>

48
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for us was,</v>

49
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we,</v>

51
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we admitted from the stars and this is</v>

52
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>not about the schools per se.</v>

53
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.980
<v Speaker 1>This is about how a system has accepted</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure of a time.</v>

54
00:02:36.981 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 1>And if we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to succeed,</v>

55
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 1>then we need to understand that a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there has to be a process of</v>

56
00:02:43.401 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>renewal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

57
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>and we need to give a new schools a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

58
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it wasn't hard for us,</v>

59
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of making the decision.</v>

60
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>It was hard to implement it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:57.051 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>we closed a six last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

62
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>we're closing another five this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just announced it on Tuesday.</v>

63
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd already launched in that process</v>

64
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:10.894
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

65
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.430
<v Speaker 1>of having conversations with community</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

66
00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>takes tremendous energy from staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.553
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.371
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

70
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does by the way,</v>

71
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 1>that there's this debate about whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to improve school systems is to</v>

72
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 1>close schools to turn him around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

73
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I think it takes everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

74
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.000
<v Speaker 1>we closed some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we turned some around in terms of,</v>

75
00:03:35.001 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bringing in new programs.</v>

76
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

77
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but the closure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:03:40.871 --> 00:03:44.220
<v Speaker 1>of the worst performing schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

79
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>as long as we're providing something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is better,</v>

81
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of the exchange.</v>

82
00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>it's been a hard thing for us to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but something that I think is making the</v>

84
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 1>district,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've become predictable,</v>

86
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:07.600
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a really good thing in terms of</v>

87
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how organizations work.</v>

88
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>principals understand that if,</v>

90
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the outcomes go down,</v>

91
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain consequences and the</v>

92
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>consequences are not simply about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

93
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about what happens to,</v>

94
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>to an institution right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

95
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm recommending the non renewal of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>charter.</v>

96
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be the first time thought I</v>

97
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>chatted is none renewed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>in the district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>

99
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a school that has all the</v>

100
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>autonomy in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The district is advancing,</v>

101
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the school is regressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

102
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>the school loses the charter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>in the same way that a traditional</v>
<v Speaker 1>school might be close.</v>
