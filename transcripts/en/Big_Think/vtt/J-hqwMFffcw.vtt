1
00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Hearing a lot about the Internet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.320
<v Speaker 1>how your many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many devices are becoming networked</v>

3
00:00:08.321 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>computers and many of these devices are</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:10.841 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>$10 thing that you buy and you put on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your shelf and you have it for year and</v>

5
00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>you throw it away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>I think not a lot of attention is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>played,</v>

7
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>paid to the security of those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>devices and some sense of the companies</v>

8
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.590
<v Speaker 1>that are making them can't afford to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:24.683
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

10
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.950
<v Speaker 1>they can leave longstanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities.</v>

11
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>The automotive industry is another</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting example.</v>

12
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>A typical American modern automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How somewhere between 30 and a hundred</v>

13
00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>would have called embedded control</v>
<v Speaker 1>units,</v>

14
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>but in better control unit is just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>

15
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very small and run very simple code.</v>

16
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>A native on the hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are full blown linux</v>

17
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>computers or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or windows computers and they are</v>

18
00:00:48.911 --> 00:00:49.744
<v Speaker 1>networked.</v>

19
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 1>A modern car has four to five network</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections where the code,</v>

20
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>the computers on the car talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers outside of the car.</v>

21
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>So an example is there's a bluetooth</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection so that your cell phone can</v>

22
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>talk to the car so that you can play</v>
<v Speaker 1>your music from your phone on the car or</v>

23
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>you can talk on the cell phone without</v>
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>

24
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>you're having to use your hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also a telematics unit,</v>

25
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:13.810
<v Speaker 1>which is the thing that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get in an accident,</v>

26
00:01:13.811 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>we'll arrange to call nine one one or</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the paramedics come that that</v>

27
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really useful and very,</v>

28
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great safety feature means that</v>

29
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 1>your car has a cell phone number and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's possible to communicate with</v>

30
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>your car over that cell phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>connection.</v>

31
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Hackers can use those network</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections to remotely break in to the</v>

32
00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>computer system that's on your car and</v>
<v Speaker 1>white hat hackers have shown they can do</v>

33
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>that and then they can then rewrite any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the software on the car,</v>

34
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 1>replaced the code that was legitimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>put there by the car manufacturer with</v>

35
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>whatever code they want to have there.</v>

36
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>And a typical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern car,</v>

38
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>pretty much all of the functionality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car is now controlled by software.</v>

39
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So breaking is controlled site by</v>
<v Speaker 1>software because you really want to have</v>

40
00:01:56.231 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 1>antilock braking steer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acceleration is controlled by software</v>

42
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>because of cruise control and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really want to have a car that</v>

43
00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>can park parallel parking for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means steering is under software</v>

44
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The locks are under software control so</v>

45
00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you can push the key fob button and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>your locks open.</v>

46
00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially all of the functionality of</v>

47
00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:18.100
<v Speaker 1>cars or under software control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the most part,</v>

48
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having it be under software control</v>

49
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 1>means that you can get increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>functionality,</v>

50
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.700
<v Speaker 1>you can have improved safety features,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get upgrades as the car</v>

51
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:29.440
<v Speaker 1>companies figured out how to do things</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

52
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>All of that's really good.</v>

53
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the downside is that because it's</v>

54
00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:36.130
<v Speaker 1>controlled by software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if an attacker can come in and replace</v>

55
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 1>that software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can control the braking and</v>

56
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:42.130
<v Speaker 1>the acceleration and the locks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that it was under software</v>

57
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're starting to see theft rings,</v>

58
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are using electronic hacking in</v>

59
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 1>order to steal cars more easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lloyd's of London recently stopped</v>

60
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:55.210
<v Speaker 1>insuring land rovers in England unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land rovers where garaged in a</v>

61
00:02:55.211 --> 00:02:58.480
<v Speaker 1>locked facility because they were being</v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen too frequently.</v>

62
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's the kind of state of the art</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the automotive industry.</v>

63
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:07.801
<v Speaker 1>why isn't it better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one starting point is it's really</v>

65
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>hard to get good security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do tons of things right.</v>

66
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>It costs money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the car industry could improve the</v>

67
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>security of their cars and hopefully</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will eventually,</v>

68
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that improvement will cost them money.</v>

69
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And the car industry doesn't have huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit margins.</v>

70
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>They can't really afford to invest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the security unless they can recoup the</v>

71
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>costs associated with that investment by</v>
<v Speaker 1>passing the cost onto the consumer.</v>

72
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>So that means the price of the car is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be higher.</v>

73
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then why is the consumer going to go</v>

74
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>buy the car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more than the equivalent car from</v>

75
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>a different manufacturer will typically</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answers while you do advertising,</v>

76
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>you explain to the consumer why they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting more value for this extra cost.</v>

77
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you imagine car company,</v>

78
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>a car company starting a ad campaign to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain their car is more cyber secure.</v>

79
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Most consumers these days probably think</v>
<v Speaker 1>their car was already cybersecurity.</v>

80
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 1>They didn't realize that their car could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be hacked into.</v>

81
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>So the result of such an advertising</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign could in fact be to make people</v>

82
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>afraid to buy any new car whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than causing them to buy a</v>

83
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:12.340
<v Speaker 1>particular car.</v>

84
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think an advertising approach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivating consumers to pay slightly</v>

85
00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>more for a particular car is not really</v>
<v Speaker 1>viable.</v>

86
00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So that means all of the cars have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

87
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:25.540
<v Speaker 1>like basically all of the companies have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it at the same time.</v>

88
00:04:25.541 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>They all have to do this extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment that basically if the price</v>

89
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>of old cars goes up by a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's no longer this</v>

90
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>differentiation between manufacturers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and consumers would be choosing between</v>

91
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 1>cars that all have roughly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of security.</v>

92
00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back just a bit,</v>

93
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:44.470
<v Speaker 1>another reason why the car companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't advertise on the security is</v>

94
00:04:44.471 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>suppose one car company actually did go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and invest a ton in making their cars</v>

95
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>more secure and then they advertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>their car was more secure.</v>

96
00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a painting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big target on your back as far as the</v>

97
00:04:55.241 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 1>hacker community is concerned.</v>

98
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Certain uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals would take that as a</v>

99
00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 1>challenge and they would go like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

100
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>you sort of get some number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility for hacking into any car.</v>

101
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>But if you hack into the car that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the company that is advertising</v>

102
00:05:07.571 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>that their cars are secure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get way more credibility if they</v>

103
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>find a vulnerability and then publish</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

104
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>That car all of a sudden has less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is less secure than the other cars that</v>

105
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:19.840
<v Speaker 1>might actually have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerabilities,</v>

106
00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>but no one has discovered it because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability is public and people know</v>

107
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>it exists and therefore can exploit it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's this weird situation where</v>

108
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>although the car in some absolute sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more secure in a practical sense,</v>

109
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.330
<v Speaker 1>it's less secure because there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly known vulnerability.</v>

110
00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>So advertising is bad both because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could scare away consumers entirely and</v>

111
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.310
<v Speaker 1>they could direct hackers to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific car,</v>

112
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.260
<v Speaker 1>decreasing the security of that car.</v>

113
00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result.</v>

114
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>So we're left with how do you get sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the car industry as a whole to</v>

115
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:55.690
<v Speaker 1>produce more secure cars and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires some kind of external</v>

116
00:05:55.691 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might decide to do it because it's</v>

117
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>just the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Typically companies are motivated by</v>

118
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>financial reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

119
00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>they usually can't afford to do things</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because of the right thing to do.</v>

120
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of outside forces,</v>

121
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one outside force would be government</v>

122
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>regulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cars many years ago were very unsafe,</v>

123
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ralph Nader wrote famously unsafe at any</v>

124
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not prompted,</v>

125
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>federal regulations.</v>

126
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>There's the five star safety crash</v>
<v Speaker 1>rating,</v>

127
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 1>a system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

128
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 1>that that created a regime where cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>were tested for their safety and given</v>

129
00:06:29.331 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>scores and consumers could then use</v>
<v Speaker 1>those scores and making their decisions.</v>

130
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>I think creating such a regime in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>current political climate is unlikely.</v>

131
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another possibility is the insurance</v>

132
00:06:40.371 --> 00:06:43.280
<v Speaker 1>company might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the insurance industry might start to</v>

133
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>impose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put pressure,</v>

134
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.650
<v Speaker 1>financial pressure on car industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw that with the Lloyd's of London</v>

135
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.120
<v Speaker 1>refusing to ensure land rovers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't garaged in locked facilities</v>

136
00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>because of electronic theft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if the insurance companies start to</v>

137
00:06:57.441 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>notice that certain kinds of cars are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hacked into with negative</v>

138
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>consequences for theft or for accidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might increase the insurance</v>

139
00:07:05.061 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 1>premiums on that particular brand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those insurance premium is,</v>

140
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 1>might then drive consumers to cars that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have those characteristics and</v>

141
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>that might then motivate the car</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry to improve the security.</v>

142
00:07:15.111 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a long chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the moment I think that's my best</v>

143
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 1>guess as to how we'll get better</v>
<v Speaker 1>cybersecurity and in our cars.</v>

144
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.780
<v Speaker 1>But I think the car industry is in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense representative of many other</v>

145
00:07:26.781 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like medical devices or another</v>

146
00:07:29.391 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like pacemakers and insulin</v>

147
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>pumps.</v>

148
00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:37.070
<v Speaker 1>They are relatively simple computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems that are networked to other</v>

149
00:07:37.071 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it makes sense for a pacemaker to</v>

150
00:07:39.411 --> 00:07:43.160
<v Speaker 1>have a wifi device so a doctor can</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor how the heart's you doing.</v>

151
00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>But once you have that wifi connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hacker can use it to go in and modify</v>

152
00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 1>the code and the pacemaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are basically lots of examples of</v>

153
00:07:50.991 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>industries where things that previously</v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't computers at all are now not</v>

154
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:56.900
<v Speaker 1>only computers where their networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

155
00:07:56.901 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>and over time those industries will need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept that their network computers</v>

156
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 1>and start to apply security techniques</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the systems are,</v>

157
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.020
<v Speaker 1>are more secure.</v>
