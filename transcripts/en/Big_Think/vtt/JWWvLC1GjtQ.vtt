00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Sustainability is a really broad scope</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.980
<v Speaker 1>of dealing with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with conflict or with issues or</v>

3
00:00:08.981 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>challenges that come across,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.590
<v Speaker 1>in the more developed countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:19.591
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at how we avoid abusing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment and how we can build a</v>

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>buildings in a green sustainable</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards and we're very advanced on</v>

7
00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that side.</v>

8
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>But if you go to Africa to countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Uganda and Nigeria and Ghana and if</v>

10
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you go to Central America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>the basic needs of sustainability</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes is to teach the basic hygiene</v>

12
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.200
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for children,</v>

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>giving them a toothbrush and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

14
00:00:51.301 --> 00:00:56.301
<v Speaker 1>and explaining them how to cross the</v>
<v Speaker 1>roads for safety,</v>

15
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>which is something that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar because they live in distant</v>

16
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:05.201
<v Speaker 1>and rural Arrow and working with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community around what is important for</v>

17
00:01:06.771 --> 00:01:11.771
<v Speaker 1>them as part of their sustainability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they build their capabilities over</v>

18
00:01:11.961 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

19
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.270
<v Speaker 1>Whether again this is more of a health</v>
<v Speaker 1>care issues,</v>

20
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>education around topics and we embrace</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environmental issues into these,</v>

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>these ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a very soft way.</v>

22
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>So there is a big difference for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainability in the developed or in</v>

23
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>the third world countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the developed world,</v>

24
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>we're doing these big water project in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bahamas.</v>

25
00:01:38.181 --> 00:01:43.181
<v Speaker 1>It's a $90,000,000 project on reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>water leakage in the system.</v>

26
00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>Over 10 year period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will reduce the water leakage from 50</v>

27
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:55.970
<v Speaker 1>percent to 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've been doing a lot of work</v>

28
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>around education of people working with</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

29
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>working with children about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of water,</v>

30
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.260
<v Speaker 1>about the importance of saving water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about creating the awareness of why</v>

31
00:02:09.111 --> 00:02:14.111
<v Speaker 1>water or are so crucial in our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why clean water are so crucial in our</v>

32
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sustainability for these</v>

33
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>specific citizens in this specific area</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

34
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.020
<v Speaker 1>So you can combine the message according</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what you do and according to what the</v>

35
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 1>people on the ground needs and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things being been very successful.</v>

36
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>You can save a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only water,</v>

37
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of money for these schools and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for these families.</v>

38
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 1>If you make and create the awareness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>education programs around that.</v>
