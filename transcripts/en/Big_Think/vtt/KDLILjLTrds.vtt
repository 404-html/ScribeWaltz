00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>The animal kingdom is full of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing behaviors typically in which</v>

3
00:00:10.861 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>males are trying to attract females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>so most of the time through the animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>kingdom,</v>

5
00:00:16.411 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>females are the ones who tend to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>choosy.</v>

6
00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm so they pick between different males</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on their attributes in part</v>

7
00:00:23.611 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>because males typically don't donate</v>
<v Speaker 1>much other than their good sperm and</v>

8
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.810
<v Speaker 1>they're good jeans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>so females,</v>
<v Speaker 1>females tend to care a lot about your,</v>

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>how good a male looks you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how awesome his song is,</v>

11
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>how great his dances and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this leads to a pressure for males</v>

12
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>to kind of ratchet it up and have a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an arms race in terms of how awesome</v>

13
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>their dances and their song is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so on,</v>

14
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>some of my favorite examples of a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of males ratcheting it up,</v>

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our cases of a species known as the buff</v>

16
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>breasted Sandpiper.</v>

17
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this otherwise kind of drab looking</v>

18
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Brown Arctic bird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a drab looking because know lives</v>

19
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>in the Arctic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to get food and do everything.</v>

20
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it kind of allows for it's beauty to</v>

21
00:01:04.921 --> 00:01:08.940
<v Speaker 1>come out and really strange ways and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these ways is that it has an</v>

22
00:01:08.941 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>incredibly attractive armpit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's armpit is very white,</v>

23
00:01:12.511 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>very clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it will do a flash displays for</v>

24
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 1>females were males will kind of get out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the field and sort of flash it's</v>

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>armpit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the female like the armpit,</v>

26
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>they kind of fly from miles and miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll kind of do this</v>

27
00:01:25.321 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>wonderful display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.760
<v Speaker 1>in the female's fall for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think this is wonderful,</v>

29
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.013
<v Speaker 1>but you can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of which males have the sexy</v>
<v Speaker 1>armpits by,</v>

31
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ones are kind of flashing all the</v>

32
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:35.124
<v Speaker 1>females were there.</v>

33
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>they're also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>other species in which males do</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible dances to move females.</v>

36
00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a species of bird known as a</v>

37
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>mannequin in which a males actually do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>really elaborate dancing display.</v>

38
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It actually involves two partners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of senior male who</v>

39
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>gets to mate with the females and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another male who apprentices with him</v>

40
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>and has to learn the dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the female picks on the dance of</v>

41
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.980
<v Speaker 1>both of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the senior guy gets the</v>

42
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>girl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then eventually the apprentice will</v>

43
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of inherit the dancing court and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the lady.</v>
