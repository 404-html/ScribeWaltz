<v Speaker 1>They want you to buy in her life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite example of this ridiculous,</v>

2
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>which is Nascar.</v>

3

<v Speaker 2>it's somewhat legitimate because here's</v>

5
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 2>actual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an actual sport behind this brand.</v>

6
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 2>There's actually a product that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>can get.</v>

7
00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

8
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got a lot of different angles to</v>

9
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but NASCAR sales romance novels and ask</v>

10
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 2>ourselves packaged meats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nascar is this massive lifestyle brand</v>

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 2>that wants to find all kinds of touch</v>
<v Speaker 2>points to draw you further into the</v>

12
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 2>NASCAR lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

13
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 2>so from a consumer perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what brands do you like?</v>

15
00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 2>How are they drawing you in so that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend more of your money with them?</v>

16
00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Is it apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:00:58.751 --> 00:01:00.770
<v Speaker 2>would you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you buy an apple product even if</v>

18
00:01:00.771 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't as good as something else?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it a certain brand of clothing?</v>

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm Thomas Pink makes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes great shirts,</v>

20
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:12.500
<v Speaker 2>but they also spray a certain linen</v>
<v Speaker 2>scent into every one of their stores.</v>

21
00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not just let the linen smell like</v>

22
00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:15.231
<v Speaker 2>linen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's certain marketing tactics these</v>

24
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:21.911
<v Speaker 2>brands use to try and generate a feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory feel of psychological feel,</v>

25
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.360
<v Speaker 2>a belonging and community and ritual and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that's,</v>

26
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 2>that that's for the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that kind of sense of community</v>

27
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that brands are after with lifestyle I'm</v>

28
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>pitches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would that feel of being part of a</v>

29
00:01:35.151 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 2>community around a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apple is another good example.</v>

30
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Nascar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these,</v>

31
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these communities that bubble up around</v>

32
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 2>popular brands and they tried to capture</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and then</v>

33
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.520
<v Speaker 3>sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sell you more products.</v>

34
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>BMW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yoga,</v>

35
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>wear</v>

36
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 2>for clothing or Cheetos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lip balm.</v>

37

<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

38
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this lifestyle stuff,</v>

39
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 2>it does begin to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's corrosive to the,</v>

40
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 2>to the sense of where our communities</v>
<v Speaker 2>are formed.</v>

41
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 2>Are Our communities formed around brands</v>
<v Speaker 2>like apple now and Nascar?</v>

42
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

43
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>

44
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.041
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should,</v>

45
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

46
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:26.001
<v Speaker 2>they kind of become more virtual and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more online and brands are set up to</v>

47
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.340
<v Speaker 2>kind of put tolls around those</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences.</v>

48
00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 2>And also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 2>also true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

50
00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

51
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.933
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

52
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 2>the damage to how we relate together as</v>
<v Speaker 2>people and how we form relationships.</v>

53
00:02:39.691 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 2>And think of ourselves even in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our identity and our self esteem or</v>

54
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:45.020
<v Speaker 2>aspirations.</v>

55
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 3>It is largely influenced by marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now more important than ever.</v>
