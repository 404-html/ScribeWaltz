WEBVTT

1
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>We usually have the application on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>website for about two months and we go</v>

2
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>out and do presentations at different</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

3
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that can be one</v>
<v Speaker 1>presentation and the entire school comes</v>

4
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:23.910
<v Speaker 1>as an assembly or you go from class to</v>
<v Speaker 1>class or it changes based on what</v>

5
00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we do presentations and you know,</v>

6
00:00:26.101 --> 00:00:28.980
<v Speaker 1>encourage cause the sign up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then about a month or so before the</v>

7
00:00:28.981 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go through the selection process and</v>

8
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>we picked the groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then from then we make sure that we</v>

9
00:00:34.111 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>have two meetings with students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and then two meetings with just</v>

10
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 1>so that they get to know each other a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit before we go.</v>

12
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And we get to give them the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our organization and what we've done,</v>

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>kind of what we're getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we fly down as a group.</v>

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>And in New Orleans we actually own a bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just bought a second bus,</v>

15
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>which was really exciting.</v>

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>so when we're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we drive around in our buses.</v>

18
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.853
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first day is mostly just flying and</v>

20
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:00.000
<v Speaker 1>settling in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

21
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>the first full day we go on the levy</v>
<v Speaker 1>tour and like we start with an</v>

22
00:01:03.241 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>orientation about the history of Nyt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who we've worked with,</v>

23
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we've gotten to where we're at.</v>

24
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we go out on the tour and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually see the different levies and</v>

25
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>see the different neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

26
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we give everyone an opportunity to kind</v>

27
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>of see with their own eyes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what it is that they're</v>

28
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>getting themselves into and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods that they'll be doing work</v>

29
00:01:23.531 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:27.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big day.</v>

31
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no physical work really on that</v>

32
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.900
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the roughest day for everyone</v>

33
00:01:30.901 --> 00:01:35.901
<v Speaker 1>because it's so emotionally and mentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>draining because most people have never</v>

34
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>heard anything like this before or seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like this before.</v>

35
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's usually how that day goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>and every night we have a debrief and</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically the way that that works is we</v>

37
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>bring everybody together and we sit in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>circle and we run by consensus.</v>

38
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>And so what we do is we sit in a circle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have,</v>

39
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have around and so every week</v>

40
00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.100
<v Speaker 1>everybody has about one minute to speak</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their day and their feelings of</v>

41
00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>the day or any thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once we've gotten around the whole</v>

42
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>circle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we go into what we call crosstalk.</v>

43
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And then anybody can just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interject and say whatever they want.</v>

44
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And I've realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>over time that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the round is really just kind of like a</v>

46
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>warmup for the cross talk because when</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have the freedom to like really</v>

47
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>say what they want to say without so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much time constraints,</v>

48
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>it all breaks loose.</v>

49
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And you never know what's really going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come up.</v>

50
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>But that's where the real learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

51
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.223
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first debrief that's of the levy</v>

53
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>tour are usually that just are mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing.</v>

54
00:02:30.031 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And then each day following that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

55
00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.140
<v Speaker 1>they are as well there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they're different every day.</v>

56
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 1>And I guess starting on the second day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>we now work with a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and in the morning our</v>

58
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>students do physical work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's gutting a house,</v>

59
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>cutting down grass and yards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm big projects that we work on</v>

61
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>our building community gardens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we do that in the morning and</v>

62
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:56.940
<v Speaker 1>then in the afternoon we go canvasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

63
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just knocking on people's doors and</v>

64
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>speaking to residents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really the most important</v>

65
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>part of the trip because it gives our</v>
<v Speaker 1>students a chance to speak to the people</v>

66
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>who are actually here for Katrina and</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really lived through this and who</v>

67
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>are dealing with these issues day to</v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

68
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>And they hear it from them and not from</v>
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>

69
00:03:12.551 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>not from the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not from the government,</v>

70
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>like directly from the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

71
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.470
<v Speaker 1>we break people into pairs and they go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

72
00:03:18.471 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's really great on a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different levels.</v>

73
00:03:20.711 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a primary source for our students</v>

74
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>to really get information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.100
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means a lot to the residents because</v>

76
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>really the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ninth ward,</v>

77
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>there's really only one house on a block</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain areas,</v>

78
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some places are more populated than</v>

79
00:03:36.371 --> 00:03:37.121
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

80
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still pretty desolate.</v>

81
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:42.910
<v Speaker 1>So to see for them to see volunteers</v>
<v Speaker 1>from New York come down just to hear</v>

82
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>what they have to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

83
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not about like filling out a flyer</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

84
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or doing a survey or anything.</v>

85
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.570
<v Speaker 1>It's really just to hear what they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say and,</v>

86
00:03:51.571 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>and stuff like that.</v>

87
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>So it means a lot to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for us,</v>

88
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 1>for our students,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great because,</v>

89
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.491
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:57.491 --> 00:03:59.560
<v Speaker 1>they get a connection with a real person</v>
<v Speaker 1>down there.</v>

91
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the two people that we pair up generally</v>

92
00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.550
<v Speaker 1>probably won't have known each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>

93
00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially earlier on in the week.</v>

94
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>And so just the experience that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>two students have walking down the</v>

95
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>streets of New Orleans together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knocking on homes and meeting these</v>

96
00:04:12.521 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>amazing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

97
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it bonds them forever and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

98
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:21.571
<v Speaker 1>like two people who would have never</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever second given each other a second</v>

99
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>look ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be best friends by the end of</v>

100
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:26.044
<v Speaker 1>that one day.</v>

101
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the most,</v>

102
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>the most dangerous work that we have is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also the most fun work.</v>

103
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>It's gutting homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we've been doing that since the very</v>

104
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>first trip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are less homes,</v>

105
00:04:36.791 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>the gut now than there used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

106
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.761
<v Speaker 1>but we still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

107
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:42.370
<v Speaker 1>we just did one this February.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're probably going to do some in April</v>

108
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

109
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>that means it's basically stripping a</v>
<v Speaker 1>house down to the bare bones and the</v>

110
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:50.380
<v Speaker 1>bear foundation of a house because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes that were lucky enough to stay</v>

111
00:04:50.381 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>standing in New Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Ninth Ward,</v>

112
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>still had 20 feet of water for about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

113
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So everything on the inside was</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>

114
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>So we have to go in and we have to knock</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the walls,</v>

115
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take out the furniture,</v>

116
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>the sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrical,</v>

117
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just strip it down so that it can</v>

118
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:08.314
<v Speaker 1>then be rebuilt.</v>

119
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>And usually everybody loves to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they get to use sledge hammers or</v>

120
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take their anger out on a wall or</v>

121
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

122
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:16.300
<v Speaker 1>people love to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

123
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty safe.</v>

124
00:05:18.221 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one person in our three years has</v>

125
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>stepped on a nail and it was our teacher</v>
<v Speaker 1>who told us to get tetanus shots and he</v>

126
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's his fault,</v>

127
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>but he was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

128
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.261
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.730
<v Speaker 1>so we've never really had a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

130
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>And otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

131
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with rebuilding homes,</v>

132
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>we're always with professionals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people who know exactly what</v>

133
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.960
<v Speaker 1>they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can handle,</v>

134
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.250
<v Speaker 1>who really handled the heavy machinery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have worked on dry walling and</v>

135
00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>sanding and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.610
<v Speaker 1>mudding and painting and all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that type of stuff.</v>

137
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Another big part of the physical work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>mowing lawns.</v>

138
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people at first are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not excited to do it because it's</v>

139
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.980
<v Speaker 1>mowing lawns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do that anywhere,</v>

140
00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what's the reason why it's so</v>

141
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:04.330
<v Speaker 1>important is because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

142
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.890
<v Speaker 1>the city of New Orleans created this law</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the good neighbor law.</v>

143
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>And it says that at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anyone's grasp reaches above 18</v>

144
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>inches there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then fined $500 a day by the city.</v>

145
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

146
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still about 200,000</v>

147
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:21.680
<v Speaker 1>residents of New Orleans who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who haven't been able to come home that</v>

148
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>has spread out in all 50 states of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States in you have 6,000 of them</v>

149
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>still in New York City right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are thousands in Texas.</v>

150
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>There's some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in Alaska,</v>

151
00:06:30.231 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about culture shock being taken</v>

152
00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 1>from New Orleans and being relocated</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

153
00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

154
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still everywhere but in their</v>

155
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>homes and the government is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>mandating that they come home once a</v>

156
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:42.350
<v Speaker 1>week to mow their lawns and if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

157
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:43.970
<v Speaker 1>they're going to find them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that they can't afford.</v>

159
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:49.910
<v Speaker 1>our job is really to go in there and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

161
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>mow their lawn so that these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to pay their fines.</v>

162
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.600
<v Speaker 1>Usually we go and mow the lawns of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who we are in contact with,</v>

163
00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.380
<v Speaker 1>whether they're in New Orleans or people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know that have,</v>

164
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.370
<v Speaker 1>that are still displaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we like run out of the list,</v>

165
00:07:04.371 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't happen very often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes then we'll just go and</v>

166
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we see a lot that needs to be</v>

167
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.810
<v Speaker 1>cleared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we clear it because we know somebody</v>

168
00:07:11.811 --> 00:07:15.110
<v Speaker 1>somewhere is paying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some is paying $500 a day for that.</v>

169
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we don't know the person</v>

170
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we want to,</v>

171
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.300
<v Speaker 1>we know it's helping someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's another piece of the physical</v>

172
00:07:23.301 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

173
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on community gardens is,</v>

174
00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.990
<v Speaker 1>is a newer project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

175
00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.100
<v Speaker 1>we've just started to do that this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

176
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.690
<v Speaker 1>it's so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

177
00:07:32.691 --> 00:07:34.010
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most important things</v>

178
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:36.590
<v Speaker 1>that we're doing because in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the lower ninth ward itself,</v>

179
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>there's only one grocery store and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more like a Bodega and they pretty</v>

180
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 1>much just sell alcohol anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the people either are resorted to</v>

181
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:48.750
<v Speaker 1>go there and buy really unhealthy food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

182
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.400
<v Speaker 1>or travel 20 miles outside of the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the ninth ward to go to a</v>

183
00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:58.220
<v Speaker 1>bigger grocery store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of people can't afford to</v>

184
00:07:58.221 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is so important about these</v>

186
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:07.271
<v Speaker 1>community gardens is that it's creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>sources of food and healthy food,</v>

187
00:08:07.431 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 1>fruits and vegetables for residents to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

188
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 1>to eat within an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's being grown within their own</v>

189
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

190
00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>And it's also providing jobs for members</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the community who otherwise don't</v>

191
00:08:17.541 --> 00:08:18.670
<v Speaker 1>have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 1>because they can work on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one major thing is that we're</v>

193
00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 1>working with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we helped start there.</v>

194
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.350
<v Speaker 1>There also is an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

195
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>a high school in the whole lower ninth</v>
<v Speaker 1>ward anymore.</v>

196
00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>There were two and the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

197
00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tore both of them down,</v>

198
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>one of which in the middle of our us</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in there,</v>

199
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:35.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gutting it.</v>

200
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a group there and they forced the</v>

201
00:08:37.701 --> 00:08:40.310
<v Speaker 1>entire group out and they knocked it</v>
<v Speaker 1>down right in front of us.</v>

202
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>This was two years ago and it running</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now there's nothing in its place.</v>

203
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just grass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They haven't done anything with the</v>

204
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it didn't really make sense to me.</v>

205
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Speaker 1>But either way they tore both of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings down.</v>

206
00:08:50.301 --> 00:08:54.560
<v Speaker 1>So one of our projects has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've helped start now the only high</v>

207
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.230
<v Speaker 1>school there.</v>

208
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>It's really a technically a homeschool</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

209
00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>it's all that the people have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm one of our teachers who taught</v>

210
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>at our school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came down with us this past summer and</v>

211
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>just kind of decided not to come home</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he stayed there and he helped start</v>

212
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>the school and he's getting more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more students every week.</v>

213
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has actually gotten the rights to the</v>

214
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 1>land surrounding the school and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>turning those into community gardens.</v>

215
00:09:18.061 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And right now we fund finance the school</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on our fundraisers.</v>

216
00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 1>But the goal is once they are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing fruits and vegetables,</v>

217
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 1>the students will learn how to garden</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how to farm,</v>

218
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>which is great for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to just know.</v>

219
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.640
<v Speaker 1>But also they can then sell those fruits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and vegetables and that money is what's</v>

220
00:09:32.641 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>going to finance this.</v>
