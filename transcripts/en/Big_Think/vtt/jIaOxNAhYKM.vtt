00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>If you're graduating right now or you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>just graduated,</v>

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I would make a very simple observation.</v>

3
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.550
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

4
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Because I think you're very lucky to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>graduating now because 25 years ago when</v>

5
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>people graduated and went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

6
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:25.151
<v Speaker 1>had a job in investment banking and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful careers at,</v>

7
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:30.401
<v Speaker 1>let's say today they're in their middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>to late fifties and they've just retired</v>

8
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>and you meet them at a cocktail party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they tell you about</v>

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>CEO of an investment bank?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tell you about the peace corps</v>

10
00:00:40.911 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>years and what they did in the Peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corps.</v>

11
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

12
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>you've just had this amazing life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the peace corps.</v>

13
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>And then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.400
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm going to use the rest of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life to do something meaningful,</v>

15
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my kids are graduated empty nest and</v>

16
00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I now I'm going to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful.</v>

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.690
<v Speaker 1>And I say to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

18
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.691
<v Speaker 1>here's somebody who graduated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically did something meaningless for</v>

19
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>a period of time and then decided to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something meaningful.</v>

20
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm so enthusiastic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who graduate today is that we're</v>

21
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:22.871
<v Speaker 1>starting to understand that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to have meaningful lives all</v>

22
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 1>the way along and to be a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur.</v>

23
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>If you want to put your entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy in that way,</v>

24
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.670
<v Speaker 1>to do things that in fact do mix market</v>
<v Speaker 1>with mission.</v>

25
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.950
<v Speaker 1>It's in fact a period today where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can take an avocation and turn it into</v>

26
00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:45.641
<v Speaker 1>something that's very intimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected with what you do and if you</v>

27
00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:52.691
<v Speaker 1>toying with taking a job because it pays</v>
<v Speaker 1>well but you hate it,</v>

29
00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever do that because it is be the</v>

30
00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 1>saddest peer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to wake up every morning</v>

31
00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>unless you really wake up and not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>smile about it,</v>

32
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:08.510
<v Speaker 1>but you tell your spouse or your family</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>

33
00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Then how excited you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the life you want to live in more</v>

34
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:15.770
<v Speaker 1>than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots and lots of people can do that and</v>

35
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:19.790
<v Speaker 1>so that's why I think graduating today</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be really interesting.</v>

36
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were a bit more in lockstep,</v>

37
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>obedience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you did things because you were</v>

38
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 1>supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity didn't include making the</v>

39
00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>world a better.</v>
