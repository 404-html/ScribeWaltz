1
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a vast number to choose from and</v>

2
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:15.981
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it's worth emphasizing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary nature of the selection</v>

3
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:21.591
<v Speaker 1>process if once thinking in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of past human beings,</v>

4
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>it's extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>how hard it is to make a selection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally the selection has been made</v>

6
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but previous historians by posterity,</v>

7
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.430
<v Speaker 1>by the contemporaries who built statues</v>
<v Speaker 1>or books about a famous men and women.</v>

8
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>And so often one finds oneself writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people who are already a great or</v>

9
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>evil men or women before you even show</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

10
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>But I find myself recently in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the book called the war of the world</v>

11
00:00:56.071 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>writing considerable amount about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Winston Churchill,</v>

12
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Stalin at all fit Franklin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt,</v>

13
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes and villains of,</v>

14
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But part of what I do is to try to,</v>

15
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>to write the history of non political</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

16
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>like firms to look at the history of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of capitalism,</v>

17
00:01:16.801 --> 00:01:20.040
<v Speaker 1>the history of business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to give equal billing to</v>

18
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs as well as to generals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

19
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Because I think the history of modernity</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually requires that balance to be</v>

20
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 1>struck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get to know slightly less</v>

21
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>familiar figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first hero of any book I ever wrote</v>

22
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>was a German Jewish banker named Max</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viral called Warburg.</v>

23
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who turned into the hero of my doctoral</v>

24
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>dissertation rather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my own surprise,</v>

25
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.350
<v Speaker 1>simply because as I rummaged around in</v>
<v Speaker 1>archives and Humberg trying to</v>

26
00:01:46.351 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>understand why Germany had imploded</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically in the 1920s,</v>

27
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.110
<v Speaker 1>he kept cropping up and emerged as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>central,</v>

28
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>a hero of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

29
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 1>of my first book paper and Darren,</v>

30
00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 2>oh.</v>
