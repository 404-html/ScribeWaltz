00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Other people can learn from writer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>life many things because La la writers'</v>

2
00:00:11.141 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>lives are so different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are processed.</v>

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>It's something that comes from outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some our process with their visions</v>

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>likes of me are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work like a cloak and then also my</v>

5
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:30.271
<v Speaker 1>books are more like frescoes and epic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I start from a corner and continue</v>

6
00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:36.631
<v Speaker 1>and continue without even knowing what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the final picture will be in the end.</v>

7
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>40 years of devotion to the art of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>novel taught me one thing that is to pay</v>

8
00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>attention to people's lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay attention.</v>

9
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>What you wrote here about people's lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>this now as strange as in my mind is</v>

10
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:57.721
<v Speaker 1>based on interviews that I did with lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that that also taught me to be</v>

11
00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.500
<v Speaker 1>modest about people's life and play</v>
<v Speaker 1>around with the details of their lives</v>

12
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>til it really sounds more real than</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

13
00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Most of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not have a proper editor since I</v>

14
00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>was writing in Istanbul.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am my own editor,</v>

15
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.710
<v Speaker 1>but the secret of writing is the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

16
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Self editing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editing,</v>

17
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>leading to your beloved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to your wife,</v>

18
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>to your daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Your partner and hearing the story</v>

19
00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>from other people's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never giving up your high standard of</v>

20
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>criteria of good writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but continuing on and on and on and on,</v>

21
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.430
<v Speaker 1>and editing and editing and care taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

22
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much time you gave to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful page,</v>

23
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that can also be cut out.</v>
