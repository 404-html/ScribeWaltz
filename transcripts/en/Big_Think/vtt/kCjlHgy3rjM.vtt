00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.503
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

2
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's any time soon.</v>

3
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to first be treated</v>
<v Speaker 1>equally within society.</v>

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once we are treated equally within</v>

5
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:19.850
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we then have an opportunity for</v>

6
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] to participate more fully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think of it this way,</v>

7
00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>there's over 500,000 elected official</v>
<v Speaker 1>positions in the United States of</v>

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,000 from local city council to water</v>

9
00:00:30.051 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>district and president of the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

10
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.510
<v Speaker 1>There's less than 300 who are openly gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>or lesbian,</v>

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 1>bisexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or transgender.</v>

12
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's a long way to go in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>represent elected representation of a</v>

13
00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>community that is certainly much larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>than its elected representation is</v>

14
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.460
<v Speaker 1>within that community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 1>so we have a ways to go in that respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that day will come.</v>
