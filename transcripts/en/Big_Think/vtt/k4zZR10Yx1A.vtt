00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you have to know when to say goodbye</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pieces that you love but just don't</v>

2
00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>make economic sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>it's the toughest thing for me to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I like,</v>

4
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I think I fantasize myself as some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

5
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curator on a deadline every,</v>

6
00:00:23.321 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every season.</v>

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are always the two to $3,000</v>

8
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:34.381
<v Speaker 1>experiments that do not make economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense in which I get wrapped on the</v>

9
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>knuckles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow executives at Southerby's,</v>

12
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>you without a doubt the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.690
<v Speaker 1>in the better 20th century design</v>
<v Speaker 1>options is to focus on the higher and</v>

14
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:51.910
<v Speaker 1>higher value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what makes economic sense.</v>

15
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.320
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt I spend much more of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>time focusing on the few pieces that are</v>

17
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:04.711
<v Speaker 1>worth in the six figures then I can with</v>
<v Speaker 1>collections of objects that are worth a</v>

18
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>few thousand dollars a piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the most difficult thing is to say</v>

19
00:01:10.271 --> 00:01:15.271
<v Speaker 1>goodbye to a piece that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you really treated it with,</v>

20
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>with a kind of reverence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

21
00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced to a new group of collectors,</v>

22
00:01:21.941 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but that it's just not ready yet for</v>
<v Speaker 1>primetime.</v>

23
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you hate it.</v>

24
00:01:25.841 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 1>If that piece ends up at a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a smaller auction house,</v>

25
00:01:28.661 --> 00:01:30.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it doesn't get photographed very</v>

26
00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe it ends up on Ebay and you</v>

27
00:01:33.431 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to,</v>

28
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you have to know when.</v>
