1
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.870
<v Speaker 1>I began to write this book on November</v>
<v Speaker 1>third,</v>

2
00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.280
<v Speaker 1>2004.</v>

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I had come back to the states to give a</v>
<v Speaker 2>series of lectures on my last book,</v>

4
00:00:13.031 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 2>which is on the subject of evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I timed those lectures to coincide</v>

5
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:19.990
<v Speaker 2>with what I thought would be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebration of the end of the Bush</v>

6
00:00:19.991 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>

7
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:26.530
<v Speaker 2>on November third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2004 as I sat there drinking for double</v>

8
00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 2>Espressos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a trying to get myself off the floor</v>

9
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 2>enough to talk about evil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt particularly disturbed about the</v>

10
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:40.480
<v Speaker 2>fact that people claimed they had voted</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the Democrats because the</v>

11
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Democrats were lacking in moral clarity</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they didn't have moral values.</v>

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 2>I think particularly looked at from</v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>

13
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 2>Although most Americans now see it that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

14
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 2>And administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's reinstituted torture lied its way</v>

15
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 2>into a war for which it can't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide for the soldiers who are losing</v>

16
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 2>limbs and mental health center.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

17
00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to define as being morally</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear or having strong moral values.</v>

18
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 2>But it seemed to me that I had two</v>
<v Speaker 2>choices.</v>

19
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 2>One was to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

20
00:01:14.051 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 2>all the people who voted that way have</v>
<v Speaker 2>simply been bamboozled by talk about</v>

21
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 2>values and their real interests lie</v>
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere,</v>

22
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 2>or I could examine what the faults on my</v>
<v Speaker 2>own progressive side war and to say what</v>

23
00:01:28.931 --> 00:01:33.100
<v Speaker 2>have we been doing wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that it's true that secular</v>

24
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.970
<v Speaker 2>progressives in particular have had</v>
<v Speaker 2>trouble with moral language.</v>

25
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.210
<v Speaker 2>So I decided the thing that I could best</v>
<v Speaker 2>or most helpfully do really for my</v>

26
00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>country as somebody was philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 2>skills,</v>

27
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 2>was to write a book reclaiming more</v>
<v Speaker 2>language for progressive</v>

28
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A number of ways.</v>

29
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>After the sixties,</v>

30
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 2>the left was properly concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that we had been to theoretical</v>

31
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 2>ideological and that it was part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why the left had failed in the</v>

32
00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.410
<v Speaker 2>United States was that we hadn't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>pragmatic enough and all of that was</v>

33
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the direction that the left turned</v>

34
00:02:22.561 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 2>in was I think fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of talking about ideas,</v>

35
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 2>they talked about interests and what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>had then was an interest based politics</v>

36
00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 2>which took what might have been the</v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest achievement of the civil rights</v>

37
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which was to convince many people,</v>

38
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:46.080
<v Speaker 2>and I grew up in Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a child in the middle of the civil</v>

39
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.910
<v Speaker 2>rights movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a big part of my,</v>

40
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my background is the belief that good</v>

41
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:57.471
<v Speaker 2>people have whatever background need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stand up together for a universal rights</v>

42
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>because there was an old song that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all men are slaves to our brothers are</v>

43
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

44
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 2>That's what I grew up believing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that.</v>

45
00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>I'm also symbolized by many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or at least civil rights leader.</v>

46
00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 2>A leader is Bob Moses who said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not about black versus white</v>

47
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about rational versus irrational</v>

48
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that spirit which animated</v>

49
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 2>the early civil rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people began to think that politics was</v>

50
00:03:28.631 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 2>about interest groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about black rights.</v>

51
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>It was about women's rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was about gay rights.</v>

52
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:38.071
<v Speaker 2>It was about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you see the mess that we are in now.</v>

53
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was a terrible mistake</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it took us back to the sort of</v>

54
00:03:43.901 --> 00:03:48.901
<v Speaker 2>tribal politics that are actually pre</v>
<v Speaker 2>socratic were what everybody believes</v>

55
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bottom line is my group wants power</v>

56
00:03:54.491 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 2>over your group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not in the end,</v>

57
00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 2>a direction that can mobilize or inspire</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone,</v>

58
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's the direction that the left</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wenton,</v>

59
00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 2>the right on the other hand went off to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build think tanks and it was very</v>

60
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:09.604
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>

61
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 2>You had all kinds of a businessman</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding people to read Plato and</v>

62
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 2>Aristotle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

63
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>it's quite extraordinary that you had an</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti intellectual movement on the left</v>

64
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 2>and an intellectual turn on the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they had a,</v>

65
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 2>they were thinking in long terms and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took over again.</v>

66
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a simplified view of what I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened,</v>

67
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's a piece of what I think went</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

68
00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 2>When you have conservatives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is an international question by</v>

69
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not simply a national question.</v>

70
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 2>You see the same thing happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

71
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Conservatives are using the language of</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal values that the left is no</v>

72
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 2>longer able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 2>to the use without these horrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>quotation marks,</v>

74
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 2>scare quotes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think another factor played a huge</v>

75
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in 1989,</v>

76
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>even those of us who hadn't been</v>
<v Speaker 2>communists and who had been</v>

77
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 2>distinguishing for a long time between</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we call a real existing socialism,</v>

78
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 2>which was not socialism as one wanted it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

79
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 2>I think the collapse of the Soviet Union</v>
<v Speaker 2>made painfully clear to people who had</v>

80
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 2>been wanting to avoid that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that things in real existing socialism</v>

81
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:36.121
<v Speaker 2>were even worse than we had suspected so</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was easy to take the line.</v>

82
00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 2>Many people who shared ideals that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shared and had been willing to fight and</v>

83
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:49.480
<v Speaker 2>die for them had actually wound up</v>
<v Speaker 2>committing genuine crimes,</v>

84
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>and if that's the outcome of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are willing to live and die for ideas,</v>

85
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 2>maybe the world will be better off if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>did nothing.</v>

86
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 2>I think it was understandable</v>
<v Speaker 2>conclusion,</v>

87
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 2>not a correct conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're still reeling from that</v>

88
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're now talking about it.</v>

89
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a 18 years ago.</v>

90
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 2>It's not very long that we've had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>rethink things were still in the process</v>

91
00:06:12.441 --> 00:06:15.530
<v Speaker 2>of rethinking and I'm hoping to</v>
<v Speaker 2>contribute to that.</v>
