00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.183
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to body language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never an exact art and the things</v>

3
00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to suggest that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines,</v>

4
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that said,</v>

5
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>there are some certain things that as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>poker player,</v>

6
00:00:18.791 --> 00:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>I'll look for a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the most important thing is first of</v>

7
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get sort of a baseline of somebody.</v>

8
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>It's impossible to tell whether the</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior someone's showing is meaningful</v>

9
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>or not if you don't know how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally behave.</v>

10
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.310
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing I'll do when I sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>down at the table is look at what my</v>

11
00:00:39.311 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>opponents are doing when they're not in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hand,</v>

12
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they naturally quite gregarious?</v>

13
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Are they confident when they interact</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the white dress or are they</v>

14
00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>naturally quite quiet and shy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>how do they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do they sit?</v>

16
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Are they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they naturally closed off,</v>

17
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 1>are they very languishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

18
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>And then once I've got an idea of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseline outside of a hand,</v>

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>then I looked to see how they deviate</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that when they're actually in the</v>

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.191
<v Speaker 1>middle of playing or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

21
00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:09.610
<v Speaker 1>in a tense situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in general,</v>

22
00:01:09.611 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>what you want to look for in both poker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also when you have to say,</v>

23
00:01:13.241 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out if someone's lying</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the comfort level.</v>

24
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

25
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>if there's sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they seem authentic,</v>

26
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>like as a rule of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans are actually quite good at</v>

27
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>picking up a authenticity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>or if someone's being disingenuous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's sort of the thing to look out</v>

30
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're all some like classic</v>

31
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 1>behaviors that I've noticed people do at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the table where they'll,</v>

32
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll sort of make a point of if,</v>

33
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>if you see them suddenly making a point</v>
<v Speaker 1>of making themselves bigger,</v>

34
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where they're naturally setting</v>

35
00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>like this and now they're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>puffing up a,</v>

36
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>that's more often than not sort of false</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence at that they're trying to</v>

37
00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people do try to stay very</v>

39
00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>constant.</v>

40
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you've noticed sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you really do notice a behavior</v>

41
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:09.220
<v Speaker 1>particularly against someone who seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play quite regularly to,</v>

42
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>chances are they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're aware of their behavior.</v>

43
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 1>So they're probably trying to mislead</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

44
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>But another rule of thumb I like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow is the first thing you learn as a</v>

45
00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.530
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually when you lie,</v>

46
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:22.364
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

47
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>lawyers won't look you in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do pick what the kids do to</v>

48
00:02:25.481 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>overcompensate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>

49
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll look you in the eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 1>and similarly people are very aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their faces and you know,</v>

51
00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>this part of their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're trying to be dishonest,</v>

52
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but what they're not thinking about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of their body.</v>

53
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>So the lower down on the body that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at,</v>

54
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 1>the more reliable the information is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about when you were</v>

55
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>excited about something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

56
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:51.960
<v Speaker 1>you will bounce around and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of,</v>

57
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>you can't keep still.</v>

58
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like,</v>

59
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>we call it happy feet in poker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the feet are often the most reliable to</v>

60
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:04.561
<v Speaker 1>look at on your opponent because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be completely stoic in their face,</v>

61
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>but their feet are bouncing around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a sign that they have a</v>

62
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>really strong hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But similarly,</v>

63
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>if they're sort of smiling and chatty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their feet all of a sudden sort of</v>

64
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>tuck themselves around the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the chair legs,</v>

65
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>something's up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

66
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a rule of thumb,</v>

67
00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:26.200
<v Speaker 1>look for the rest of someone else's body</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than their face.</v>

68
00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to figure out if</v>

69
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>they're telling you the truth or not.</v>

70
00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.360
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
