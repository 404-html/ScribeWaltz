00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.790
<v Speaker 1>What I love about this notion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>multitasking gives people brag about how</v>

2
00:00:03.791 --> 00:00:05.530
<v Speaker 1>good they are at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

3
00:00:05.531 --> 00:00:08.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lie we're telling ourselves over</v>

4
00:00:08.261 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend named Janice Marturano</v>

5
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>who is a former executive at general</v>
<v Speaker 1>mills and she now teaches meditation to</v>

6
00:00:15.371 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>corporate executives all over America</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all over the world and she pointed</v>

7
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.910
<v Speaker 1>out to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multitasking is a computer derived term.</v>

8
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Computers have many processors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have only one processor.</v>

9
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.830
<v Speaker 1>We literally neurologically cannot do</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than one thing at a time.</v>

10
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.470
<v Speaker 1>So every time you think you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>multitasking,</v>

11
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 1>essentially that's a short way of saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing many things poorly.</v>

12
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>What I've learned to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard,</v>

13
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.200
<v Speaker 1>it's to try to do one thing at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm on the phone,</v>

14
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I turn off my computer monitor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually listen radical as it may sound</v>

15
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>to the person to whom I'm speaking.</v>

16
00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>If I'm working on a story at work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a story,</v>

17
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>I shut down my email and try to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on what I'm doing.</v>

18
00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And what I found is that I moved through</v>
<v Speaker 1>my tasks in a much more rapid way and a</v>

19
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:02.230
<v Speaker 1>much more effective way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm doing a better job now.</v>

20
00:01:02.231 --> 00:01:04.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are times when we have to</v>

21
00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>multitask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it.</v>

22
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 1>Things get so hectic in my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure in the lives of anybody</v>

23
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>who's watching this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're multitasking becomes,</v>

24
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to avoid.</v>

25
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I found myself walking down the hallway</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day with a glass of water</v>

26
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>hanging out of my mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm typing away on my blackberry and</v>

27
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>walking at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a huge hypocrite on this score.</v>

28
00:01:25.331 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do my best to avoid it because I</v>

29
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>know I do my best work when I'm only</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing one thing at a time.</v>
