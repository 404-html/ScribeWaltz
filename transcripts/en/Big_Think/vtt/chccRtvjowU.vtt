1
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman recognize some of the problems</v>

2
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:12.880
<v Speaker 1>early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that you understood all that</v>

3
00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.120
<v Speaker 1>was coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly they repor recky dies the</v>

4
00:00:16.121 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>subprime mortgage crisis early in 2007</v>
<v Speaker 1>long before,</v>

5
00:00:21.101 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crunch 18 months before the big</v>

6
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>crunch hit in the fall 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had a lot of firms like ups,</v>

7
00:00:26.621 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>a Swiss from continuing to invest</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily in subprime mortgages and losing</v>

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>tens of billions more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Goldman lost about 70 million in</v>

9
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:36.940
<v Speaker 1>that crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then in August of 2007,</v>

10
00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>a very significant event took place that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I talk about in my book seven lessons.</v>

11
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three of the quantitative quantitative</v>

12
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman has went way down 30 to 40% as</v>

13
00:00:47.711 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>did all quant funds that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was,</v>

14
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.940
<v Speaker 1>this volatility was so extreme that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>management saw that there's something</v>

15
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.300
<v Speaker 1>odd going on in the markets and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>models don't predict what's going on.</v>

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pulled back and said,</v>

17
00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to start accumulating cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say hardy cash accumulating</v>

18
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:08.170
<v Speaker 1>cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they spent a full year</v>

19
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 1>accumulating a lot of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they came into the crisis in</v>

20
00:01:11.621 --> 00:01:16.621
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 with over $120 billion in cash.</v>

21
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>If Layman had had another 20 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably would have been saved,</v>

22
00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't take those kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>

23
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>And so yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a run on cash.</v>

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's liquidity crunch,</v>

25
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>but they were willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

26
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had the capacity to stand in to</v>

27
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.170
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a good lesson for all</v>

28
00:01:32.171 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I talked about in my</v>

29
00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get ready for the long haul because if</v>

30
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>you think things are bad today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get worse,</v>

31
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>not better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you need to be ready for a long</v>

32
00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>haul problem and have the cash reserves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pull you through it.</v>

33
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.971
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

34
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>I think a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a firm like Goldman,</v>

35
00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>it's human capital that matters and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you have to be so sensitive.</v>

36
00:01:53.551 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>The board spends an enormous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time on the human capital getting to</v>

37
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>know the people at all levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are the,</v>

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>who are the rising stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are the people coming up in the</v>

39
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

40
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I got a surprise as did the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

41
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>When Hank Paulson change his mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided,</v>

42
00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.680
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except president bushes offered to</v>

43
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>become secretary of the treasury.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was may of 2006 and thank goodness</v>

44
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>we not only knew Lloyd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we knew all the other top people.</v>

45
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And we can make considered decisions not</v>
<v Speaker 1>just about the CEO,</v>

46
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.200
<v Speaker 1>but who the other structure where a Gary</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cohen or Jon winkelried,</v>

47
00:02:25.201 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 1>he could step up and other people could</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on greater responsibility and</v>

48
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>awaken hanks departure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had we not known these people,</v>

49
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>we couldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're asking,</v>

50
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to be the next CFO?</v>

51
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Is gonna be the next chief personnel</v>
<v Speaker 1>officer?</v>

52
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:38.850
<v Speaker 1>It could be the next general counsel who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all these people.</v>

53
00:02:38.851 --> 00:02:42.330
<v Speaker 1>And so we have dinner with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get to see him live and in action.</v>

54
00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>They present to the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very good system.</v>

55
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.650
<v Speaker 1>It could board doesn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're in trouble.</v>

56
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>But it is human capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a tech.</v>

57
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do the technology,</v>

58
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>but everyone does the technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing unique about that.</v>

59
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.530
<v Speaker 1>The only thing unique is the human gap.</v>

60
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060
<v Speaker 1>I like the word resilient because there</v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to have with the timeframe</v>

61
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:10.640
<v Speaker 1>compressed for technology change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>and operating in global markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be more crises.</v>

63
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>This is hardly the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think firms need to be</v>

64
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>resilient and the system needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>resilient and waiting for secretary</v>

65
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>geithner and Ben Bernanki to put in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

66
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly some,</v>

67
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some complete policies including the</v>

68
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:31.190
<v Speaker 1>regulations and ensure the systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>resilience.</v>

69
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.330
<v Speaker 1>They keep talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are a year later,</v>

70
00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>nothing has been done unlike Sarbanes</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxley,</v>

71
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 1>which done in 31 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think firms need to have that</v>

72
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>resilience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them has ever,</v>

73
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.761
<v Speaker 1>resilience is never to get so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage and drive your firms so hard</v>

74
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>that you don't have the cash to fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>back on when you hit a crisis.</v>

75
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>That's why General Motors went bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why Ford,</v>

76
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came through the crisis because they'd</v>

77
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:57.390
<v Speaker 1>taken out $24 billion in loans and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>that allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has allowed for it to come through.</v>

79
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>That's very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where as GM and Chrysler had to get</v>

80
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>bailed out by the government.</v>
