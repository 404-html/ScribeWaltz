1
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about monetary policy is just</v>

2
00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:16.960
<v Speaker 1>to get to your question about why asset</v>
<v Speaker 1>prices,</v>

3
00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>where the place where some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stresses took place,</v>

4
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:24.250
<v Speaker 1>you never know exactly where the impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>will take place.</v>

5
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's in broad measures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation,</v>

6
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it's certain sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First Energy has been a commonplace.</v>

7
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 1>We're price pressures first build up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

8
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them were in the housing market</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that was because we already</v>

9
00:00:38.531 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>had beginning of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing,</v>

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom going.</v>

12
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And so in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the low interest rates did was</v>

13
00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>accelerate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus of course with the adjustable rate</v>

14
00:00:51.011 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Speaker 1>mortgages around and available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll very low interest rates enabled</v>

15
00:00:55.391 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>there to be more teaser rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more very low starting rates.</v>

16
00:00:59.381 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>And so that added to the housing boom</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

17
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.050
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this period there was a big</v>

18
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>increase in the fraction of mortgages</v>
<v Speaker 1>that came through the adjustable rate.</v>

19
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And so those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those extra low interest rates affect</v>

20
00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>the things there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also had a general increase in</v>

21
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>inflation during this period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was creeping up,</v>

22
00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each year,</v>

23
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:25.231
<v Speaker 1>2000 to 2003,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004 2005 and the and the acceleration</v>

24
00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>of the housing boom was on top of that.</v>

25
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I think the distinction between price</v>
<v Speaker 1>level targeting and inflation targeting,</v>

26
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>which has had a huge amount of attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the academic literature and has been</v>

27
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>referred to in the past such as Ben</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernanki before he became chairman.</v>

28
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.350
<v Speaker 1>I think those distinctions in practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>get blurred by the realities quite</v>

29
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It of course would be good to have a</v>

30
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:59.871
<v Speaker 1>price level targeting other things equal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would sometimes require deflation.</v>

31
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of evidence is that that's not</v>

32
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>such a good thing to have even</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally,</v>

33
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.870
<v Speaker 1>so I've always been of the view that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation target and it makes more</v>

34
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier for people to understand.</v>

35
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>We've had a lot of practice with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while there is this problem of if</v>

36
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you like of of a drift to drift of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price level sometimes called base drift</v>

37
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>overall it seems to me if we were able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep the inflation rate at a very low</v>

38
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we would effectively get similar</v>

39
00:02:28.291 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>results to price level targeting.</v>

40
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>I think the Fed cut interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.590
<v Speaker 1>they're in that period just about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

42
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it was basically coming down to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could have been a little faster at that</v>

43
00:02:47.001 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course GDP did a fall</v>

44
00:02:49.341 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>tremendously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think if they had kept the</v>

45
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:53.540
<v Speaker 1>interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:55.460
<v Speaker 1>along the same path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been fine.</v>

47
00:02:55.461 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>The problems I see at that period was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tremendous amount of uncertainty</v>

48
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:01.140
<v Speaker 1>added,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>by these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these new effects.</v>

50
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 1>If he liked the quantitative easing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes I've called somewhat</v>

51
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>pejoratively my industrial policy where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the action's went well beyond the usual</v>

52
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>interest rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think they were appropriate.</v>

53
00:03:14.801 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>We're still studying them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them were inappropriate.</v>

54
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>I just finished a study on mortgage</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rates.</v>

55
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question about whether policy</v>

56
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>could have been even easier going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panic.</v>

57
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is certainly something to examine,</v>

58
00:03:28.961 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>but I think basically it's about all it</v>
<v Speaker 1>could do at that point.</v>

59
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems I saw were not so much in</v>

60
00:03:35.321 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>monetary policy at that stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they really,</v>

61
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad hoc,</v>

62
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chaotic,</v>

63
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions that occurred around the</v>

64
00:03:45.041 --> 00:03:47.400
<v Speaker 1>time of the roll out of the tarp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not clear kind of actions with respect</v>

66
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>to what happened with Lehman brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of surprises and</v>

67
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>ultimately a lot of panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that panic was induced as</v>

68
00:03:57.581 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>I've argued in other places by</v>
<v Speaker 1>government actions.</v>

69
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I think some of the actions of the Fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the panic began were constructive</v>

70
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>to be sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't see that in terms of a</v>

71
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>faster or reductions in just rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

72
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>if I could just add,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that I think people should</v>

73
00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:19.951
<v Speaker 1>recognize is that while the federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds rate target of the FLMC came down</v>

74
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.560
<v Speaker 1>gradually in the fall of 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the actual rate came down quite a bit</v>

75
00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:27.580
<v Speaker 1>more rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

76
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:31.660
<v Speaker 1>each of the FMC decisions effectively</v>
<v Speaker 1>ratified the,</v>

77
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>what the rate was already at and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate came down so rapidly because of the</v>

78
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>large expansion in reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to see how measured in</v>

79
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:45.241
<v Speaker 1>terms of interest rates policy could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been much easier in the October,</v>

80
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.773
<v Speaker 1>November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>December period.</v>

81
00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was under the CBO advisory board for</v>

82
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:55.730
<v Speaker 1>several years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have thought a lot about that</v>

83
00:04:55.731 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 1>question about how accurate the CBO</v>
<v Speaker 1>projections are over time.</v>

84
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:05.621
<v Speaker 1>I think they do a reasonable job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They of course focus first on what's</v>

85
00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>happening with the labor force on those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those groves that are relatively easy to</v>

86
00:05:10.311 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>forecast that because you know what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population is going to be,</v>

87
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.590
<v Speaker 1>the more difficult part of course is</v>
<v Speaker 1>projecting productivity and uh,</v>

88
00:05:18.591 --> 00:05:20.780
<v Speaker 1>that's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's effectively a crap shoot.</v>

89
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.040
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to project it accurately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they do as good a job as anyone,</v>

90
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:30.041
<v Speaker 1>but you also have to realize that any</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm projection like that is subject</v>

91
00:05:30.441 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>to a tremendous of ans uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think basically the will you have to</v>

92
00:05:34.941 --> 00:05:37.070
<v Speaker 1>do is take that uncertainty into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

93
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CBO course projects much more than</v>

94
00:05:39.981 --> 00:05:42.980
<v Speaker 1>10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're projecting out many decades in</v>

95
00:05:42.981 --> 00:05:47.090
<v Speaker 1>order to get estimates of the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unfunded liabilities.</v>

96
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Those are even more uncertain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frequently there,</v>

97
00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:52.700
<v Speaker 1>there are too optimistic I think after</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch for that.</v>

98
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't have a general complaint</v>
<v Speaker 1>about longterm CBO.</v>

99
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me to doing about as best as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can and they're really not</v>

100
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 1>challenged much in one direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

101
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>things California should do to fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Its economy.</v>

102
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I think first you've got to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 1>California has enormous potential.</v>

103
00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.670
<v Speaker 1>It has a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great environment.</v>

104
00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very open to new ideas.</v>

105
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got great universities,</v>

106
00:06:24.711 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

107
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>both the University of California in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>private universities.</v>

108
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>So the potential is tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we really need to do in California,</v>

109
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.140
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal with the serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a budget problem,</v>

110
00:06:36.141 --> 00:06:40.430
<v Speaker 1>which means spending grows too much and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then taxes rise and that tends to drive</v>

111
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 1>out businesses and ultimately is harmful</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the state.</v>

112
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>So I would say number one in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

113
00:06:46.661 --> 00:06:51.661
<v Speaker 1>is put some a limit on the growth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending population growth.</v>

114
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>Plus inflation is one way to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.980
<v Speaker 1>that would prevent the ups and downs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

116
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:03.190
<v Speaker 1>and the deficits spending usually rises</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly when tax revenues rob and then</v>

117
00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.120
<v Speaker 1>tax revenues fall off and you got this</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge deficits.</v>

118
00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>So control the growth of spending number</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

119
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it put in some tax reforms that prevent</v>

120
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>the ups and downs in revenues to be so</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

121
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And here we've got a huge cyclical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>performance in tax revenues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would adopt some of the proposals</v>

123
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:27.860
<v Speaker 1>of the recent California Tax Commission</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a governor Schwarzenegger,</v>

124
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:30.250
<v Speaker 1>I introduced and third edge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.740
<v Speaker 1>education K12 it's slipping in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

126
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not a matter of of spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of spent in California.</v>

127
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.670
<v Speaker 1>It's really demanding more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountability.</v>

128
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:45.671
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to see a program where there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more for teachers and less for</v>

129
00:07:46.251 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 1>administration on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would do a lot of good.</v>

130
00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they should target bubbles</v>

131
00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The impacts of monetary policy occur</v>

132
00:07:59.001 --> 00:08:04.001
<v Speaker 1>with a long variable lags as Milton</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friedman showed many years ago and seen</v>

133
00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:08.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot of evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So timing to deal with bubbles is leaves</v>

134
00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>a lot to be desired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more important.</v>

135
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that has been the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with respect to monetary policy.</v>

136
00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:19.421
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not in this serious crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think having interest rates too low</v>

137
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 1>for too long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the 2002,</v>

138
00:08:22.431 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four period,</v>

139
00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really effectively inducing a lot of</v>

140
00:08:29.001 --> 00:08:31.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bubbles and asset prices,</v>

141
00:08:31.431 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>especially housing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if interest rates were higher,</v>

142
00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>closer to what they would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the policy followed,</v>

143
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and most of the eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think we wouldn't have had nearly</v>

144
00:08:43.131 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>as much of a booming and bus problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not as much of a bubble as we had.</v>

145
00:08:47.751 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so until policy can stop preventing</v>

146
00:08:51.441 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>bubbles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that's the number one</v>

147
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 1>priority and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people think there's somehow</v>

148
00:08:56.911 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>possible to bust them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that is not really</v>

149
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 1>feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's get back to the policies of</v>

150
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>really most of the eighties and nineties</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>

151
00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 1>was working without serious bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bubble problem,</v>

152
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:13.320
<v Speaker 1>the housing problem in this crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred primarily because of a policy</v>

153
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>getting off track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get it on track first and then</v>

154
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.970
<v Speaker 1>about the bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the bubbles will be much less of</v>

156
00:09:20.971 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 1>a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to disappear,</v>

157
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:25.570
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much less of a problem if Monterey</v>

158
00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>policy followed the kind of actions we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>

159
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through much of the eighties and</v>

160
00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.193
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

161
00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

162
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 1>given that the Taylor rule has large</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative interest rates right now,</v>

163
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:42.080
<v Speaker 1>would I want more quantitative easing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

164
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:44.430
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the Taylor rule does show</v>

165
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:47.670
<v Speaker 1>large negative interest rates right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a myth.</v>

166
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Speaker 1>Taylor rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:09:48.821 --> 00:09:50.880
<v Speaker 1>pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just says the interest rate should</v>

168
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 1>equal one and a half times the inflation</v>
<v Speaker 1>rate plus a half times the GDP gap plus</v>

169
00:09:55.801 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:09:56.941 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>if you plug in reasonable estimates for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what inflation is and what the GDP gap</v>

171
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:02.520
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a number,</v>

172
00:10:02.521 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty close to zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not minus four,</v>

173
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>minus five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not numbers like that.</v>

174
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in fact I would say the amount of</v>

175
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 1>quantitative easing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.910
<v Speaker 1>it could be reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

177
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 1>right now I hope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it is reduced in a gradual way.</v>

178
00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Some of the mortgage purchases I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be slowed down and then actually</v>

179
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.053
<v Speaker 1>reversed.</v>

180
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

181
00:10:25.111 --> 00:10:30.111
<v Speaker 1>it's a question is a good one and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>glad it was asked because there is a lot</v>

182
00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I think of misinformation out there</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what the Taylor rule says that</v>

183
00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Taylor was a very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I just mentioned,</v>

184
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:38.320
<v Speaker 1>you can say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.350
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sentence and you plug in the</v>

186
00:10:40.351 --> 00:10:43.640
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get minus five minus 6%,</v>

187
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you get something much closer to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to zero where the interest rate is now.</v>

188
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Now that of course has implications</v>
<v Speaker 1>going down the road because it says to</v>

189
00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the extent that real gd pick picks up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it does,</v>

190
00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if inflation picks up,</v>

191
00:10:58.261 --> 00:11:01.050
<v Speaker 1>hope it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if either of those occur,</v>

192
00:11:01.051 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>then you'd have to see interest rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to move above this zero to 25</v>

193
00:11:05.731 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>basis point range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't,</v>

194
00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:13.460
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to be back into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same kind of situation we were in 2002</v>

195
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:17.730
<v Speaker 1>through four and that of course could</v>
<v Speaker 1>begin to induce bubbles.</v>

196
00:11:17.731 --> 00:11:19.350
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly don't want that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

197
00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think quantitative easing at</v>

198
00:11:27.241 --> 00:11:28.350
<v Speaker 1>this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

200
00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively smooth the recovery.</v>

201
00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I think right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on historical experience,</v>

202
00:11:36.231 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 1>the interest rate is about where it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that we don't need a lot of</v>

203
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:43.140
<v Speaker 1>quantitative easing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had some,</v>

204
00:11:43.141 --> 00:11:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the job of the Fed now is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it back.</v>

205
00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is good.</v>

206
00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>So I think for me the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing now for policy to have a good</v>

207
00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:58.060
<v Speaker 1>recovery is to reduce this tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of uncertainty that exists with</v>

208
00:11:58.061 --> 00:12:01.630
<v Speaker 1>re boat for both monetary policy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiscal policy.</v>

209
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 1>And the uncertainty for monetary policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we don't know how rapidly the</v>

210
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>quantitative easing will be reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what's going to happen</v>

211
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.960
<v Speaker 1>with interest rates or is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions there.</v>

212
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:18.820
<v Speaker 1>So I'd say get back to the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were working during the great moderation</v>

213
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eighties and nineties primarily.</v>

214
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:26.020
<v Speaker 1>And that means letting interest rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise appropriately and reducing the</v>

215
00:12:26.021 --> 00:12:29.710
<v Speaker 1>amount of quantitative easing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting back to where it was a through</v>

216
00:12:29.711 --> 00:12:31.630
<v Speaker 1>most of the policy in the eighties and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

217
00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.090
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important unresolved</v>
<v Speaker 1>question and monetary economics is the</v>

218
00:12:40.091 --> 00:12:44.590
<v Speaker 1>interaction between the financial sector</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

219
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.670
<v Speaker 1>monetary policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>has been lots of thinking about it over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the years.</v>

221
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 1>Some of it actually done here at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford,</v>

222
00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:55.930
<v Speaker 1>girly and Shaw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of it done by tobin at Yale.</v>

223
00:12:55.931 --> 00:12:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

224
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Ben Bernanki has done some good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the most promising part is</v>

225
00:13:00.731 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>the combination of the newest work on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pricing of,</v>

226
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonds and securities.</v>

227
00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:11.890
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it's done by Monica PSAC and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of her colleagues to combine that</v>

228
00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.090
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

229
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 1>with monetary policy so that you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of what's going to happen to</v>

230
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:20.770
<v Speaker 1>longer term rates when the short rate is</v>
<v Speaker 1>reduced.</v>

231
00:13:20.771 --> 00:13:24.100
<v Speaker 1>What's going to happen to credit flows</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how much are credited flow is going</v>

232
00:13:24.101 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 1>to impact the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

233
00:13:27.041 --> 00:13:32.041
<v Speaker 1>this crisis has been very clear in</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating that more work on the</v>

234
00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>connection between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like financial economics and,</v>

235
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.770
<v Speaker 1>and monetary policy is needed.</v>

236
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot of questions out</v>

237
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:45.970
<v Speaker 1>there and policy about whether the</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial markets performed well or not.</v>

238
00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

239
00:13:47.501 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 1>if you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

240
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.670
<v Speaker 1>they absorbed a tremendous shock of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from policies as effectively of a panic,</v>

241
00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>induced by some,</v>

242
00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:00.980
<v Speaker 1>some ad hoc policy changes and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>responded quickly,</v>

243
00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:03.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they responded in a way which has</v>

244
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:07.090
<v Speaker 1>been smooth as the markets themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutions,</v>

245
00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:09.780
<v Speaker 1>the financial institutions of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

246
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.840
<v Speaker 1>have been great difficulty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the markets themselves have worked</v>

247
00:14:13.841 --> 00:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

248
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 1>so to me though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the where are we should focus our</v>

249
00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:19.630
<v Speaker 1>attention really is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this connection between the,</v>

250
00:14:19.631 --> 00:14:22.480
<v Speaker 1>the financial markets including the</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial institutions,</v>

251
00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the monetary policy itself.</v>

252
00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to have both</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence and accountability.</v>

253
00:14:32.591 --> 00:14:34.870
<v Speaker 1>They go together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not one or the other.</v>

254
00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 1>So in answer to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important is fed independence?</v>

255
00:14:39.401 --> 00:14:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I say it's very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a needs to be matched with</v>

256
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.690
<v Speaker 1>accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the concerns that you're seeing</v>

257
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:49.660
<v Speaker 1>in the congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the country about the Fed,</v>

258
00:14:49.661 --> 00:14:54.180
<v Speaker 1>the Ron Paul Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a reaction to what it</v>

259
00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:55.630
<v Speaker 1>looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A very uh,</v>

260
00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 1>interventionists actions by the Federal</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reserve.</v>

261
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of descriptions of how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually occurred is no,</v>

262
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.480
<v Speaker 1>no reports on what's called the section</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 three intervention,</v>

263
00:15:08.481 --> 00:15:10.670
<v Speaker 1>section 13 three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Reserve Act,</v>

264
00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

265
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>which allows for such actions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's very little reporting on how</v>

266
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:18.770
<v Speaker 1>it actually took place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the best thing the Fed can do</v>

267
00:15:18.771 --> 00:15:21.650
<v Speaker 1>to get back some of its independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quite frankly,</v>

268
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it's lost a little bit in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

269
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Best thing it can do is to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountable about some of the</v>

270
00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>intervention ventures in section 13</v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

271
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.490
<v Speaker 1>That's where most of the transparency</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerns exist at this point.</v>

272
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:37.650
<v Speaker 1>And then of course to emphasize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

273
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>the policy that has worked most well was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the policy of,</v>

274
00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.470
<v Speaker 1>of the eighties and nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we got off track of the on</v>

275
00:15:45.471 --> 00:15:46.610
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

276
00:15:46.611 --> 00:15:51.611
<v Speaker 1>things deteriorated I think did some</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition of interest rates being so</v>

277
00:15:52.821 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 1>low for so long and o two o four period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

278
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:58.260
<v Speaker 1>by the leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.100
<v Speaker 1>would be very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's discussed in the Fed system is</v>

280
00:16:01.101 --> 00:16:04.910
<v Speaker 1>disgusted by their central banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's discussed quite widely,</v>

281
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:08.930
<v Speaker 1>but so some recognition of that seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me it would be important in terms of</v>

282
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:11.260
<v Speaker 1>bringing back some of the independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

283
00:16:11.261 --> 00:16:14.060
<v Speaker 1>the Fed lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think in independence,</v>

284
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.390
<v Speaker 1>just to summarize Israeli really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

285
00:16:17.391 --> 00:16:20.930
<v Speaker 1>it's a essentially we've seen evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time about how it is,</v>

286
00:16:20.931 --> 00:16:25.820
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be matched with a strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of accountability to the Congress,</v>

287
00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 1>to the American people for what the Fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually doing.</v>

288
00:16:32.330 --> 00:16:36.440
<v Speaker 1>And See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's not the thing the Federal</v>

289
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Reserve should be doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Fed should be focusing on</v>

290
00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.270
<v Speaker 1>the overall level of interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not trying to intervene in certain</v>

291
00:16:44.271 --> 00:16:48.680
<v Speaker 1>sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a year ago I wrote a paper and</v>

292
00:16:48.681 --> 00:16:53.681
<v Speaker 1>presented at the annual meetings of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economists arguing that this was what I</v>

293
00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:59.060
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible] industrial policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's using monetary policy to intervene</v>

294
00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.750
<v Speaker 1>in certain sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain firms is of course part of that</v>

295
00:17:02.751 --> 00:17:05.030
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it'd be better if monetary</v>

296
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>policy did not do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just completed a study trying to</v>

297
00:17:09.831 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 1>look at the impacts of the purchases of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mortgage back securities by the Fed</v>

298
00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually don't think there is large</v>

299
00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.720
<v Speaker 1>had as large an impact on rates to as</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people believe.</v>

300
00:17:20.721 --> 00:17:24.710
<v Speaker 1>We'll be studying that for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more important the impact is quite</v>

301
00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:28.520
<v Speaker 1>unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very hard to measure a lot of</v>

302
00:17:28.521 --> 00:17:29.150
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty.</v>

303
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:31.910
<v Speaker 1>So the notion that the Fed could go in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business of,</v>

304
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:37.330
<v Speaker 1>of controlling the mortgage rates as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>has affected the funds rate for years I</v>

305
00:17:37.641 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>think is really a mistaken wishful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

306
00:17:41.001 --> 00:17:43.550
<v Speaker 1>It would take the Fed in the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

307
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:48.580
<v Speaker 1>So this is the more we can get back to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary policy which is focusing on the</v>

308
00:17:49.291 --> 00:17:54.291
<v Speaker 1>overall level of the money supply of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>overall level of interest rates rather</v>

309
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:56.490
<v Speaker 1>than intervene in certain sectors the</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

310
00:17:56.491 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>That's not monetary policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of things that raise</v>

311
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 1>peoples doubts about monetary policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They question,</v>

312
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>why should an independent agency of</v>
<v Speaker 1>government be intervening in certain</v>

313
00:18:07.471 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 1>sectors like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

314
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Treasury has bought a mortgage,</v>

315
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:16.290
<v Speaker 1>mortgage back securities that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise the same independence questions,</v>

316
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:18.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Fed has raised by these</v>

317
00:18:18.481 --> 00:18:19.650
<v Speaker 1>purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

318
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.940
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the biggest issues now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

319
00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.550
<v Speaker 1>to address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read,</v>

320
00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.910
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian's sacs recent speech,</v>

321
00:18:26.911 --> 00:18:30.150
<v Speaker 1>he's a at the New York Fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he acts as if this is like a new</v>

322
00:18:30.151 --> 00:18:33.150
<v Speaker 1>instrument for monetary policy in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

323
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his predecessors,</v>

324
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Peter Fisher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's now at Black Rock,</v>

325
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause this price keeping operations.</v>

326
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:45.300
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a huge amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doubts about this a,</v>

327
00:18:45.301 --> 00:18:47.820
<v Speaker 1>its effectiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its reliability,</v>

328
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.370
<v Speaker 1>and it has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

329
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:51.780
<v Speaker 1>raises questions about the Fed's</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

330
00:18:51.781 --> 00:18:56.070
<v Speaker 1>So I feel strongly that this is not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing that we should have the</v>

331
00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Fed doing in the future.</v>

332
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any reason to do</v>

333
00:19:04.711 --> 00:19:07.740
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always assumed the inflation target</v>

334
00:19:07.741 --> 00:19:11.430
<v Speaker 1>should be 2%.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If some people think it should be lower,</v>

335
00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:16.790
<v Speaker 1>let's maybe talk about changing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but varying across the business cycle</v>

336
00:19:16.831 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 1>seems to me to be just an extra element</v>
<v Speaker 1>of confusion.</v>

337
00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two people,</v>

338
00:19:21.451 --> 00:19:25.410
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is for me,</v>

339
00:19:25.411 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 1>his mood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you adjust it?</v>

340
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.000
<v Speaker 1>I think rather than move it around in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business cycle,</v>

341
00:19:30.001 --> 00:19:34.140
<v Speaker 1>is to do as good a job as possible as</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessing what,</v>

342
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:38.070
<v Speaker 1>how you measure the inflation target.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a been a lot of confusion,</v>

343
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about using the core inflation rate.</v>

344
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I've always preferred to use a smoothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>device.</v>

345
00:19:45.751 --> 00:19:49.590
<v Speaker 1>That is the average inflation rate over</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few quarters is actually a four</v>

346
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:53.940
<v Speaker 1>quarters in the Taylor rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the core rates,</v>

347
00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're consistently</v>

348
00:19:56.971 --> 00:20:01.971
<v Speaker 1>higher than the headline rates over</v>
<v Speaker 1>several years,</v>

349
00:20:02.431 --> 00:20:06.330
<v Speaker 1>then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or lower would be the other way around.</v>

350
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Then they can be misleading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for one year or so,</v>

351
00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.380
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the core and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that's important,</v>

352
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately it's the,</v>

353
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:19.920
<v Speaker 1>it's the measured inflation rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the headline inflation rate that's most</v>

354
00:20:19.921 --> 00:20:22.410
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I would focus on.</v>

355
00:20:22.411 --> 00:20:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason to be changing that that would</v>

356
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:29.580
<v Speaker 1>just add confusion and uncertainty to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what monetary policy is doing.</v>

357
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I think of these as the original cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>of he like really what got the excess is</v>

358
00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:42.670
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a big deviation,</v>

359
00:20:42.671 --> 00:20:44.460
<v Speaker 1>300 basis points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

360
00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:49.000
<v Speaker 1>we hadn't seen deviations like that</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 19 seven days,</v>

361
00:20:49.001 --> 00:20:51.460
<v Speaker 1>which of course was another period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:56.230
<v Speaker 1>lots of recession's a very severe one</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm 81,</v>

363
00:20:56.231 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 1>82.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

364
00:20:57.941 --> 00:21:02.860
<v Speaker 1>so I think that there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of evidence that says this was a</v>

365
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:08.080
<v Speaker 1>really the factor that got things going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the excess is the boom and</v>

366
00:21:08.081 --> 00:21:09.880
<v Speaker 1>ultimately the bus and housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

367
00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:13.150
<v Speaker 1>the search for a yield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extra risk taking.</v>

368
00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think you could have a guests that</v>

369
00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:22.831
<v Speaker 1>something would happen based on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous periods where central banks</v>

370
00:21:22.991 --> 00:21:27.991
<v Speaker 1>have deviated from the Taylor rule or</v>
<v Speaker 1>other similar guidelines.</v>

371
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:30.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing to me through history and</v>

372
00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:34.840
<v Speaker 1>through time how much evidence there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that when central banks deviate from</v>

373
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:38.110
<v Speaker 1>that kind of policy that things don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out well.</v>

374
00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And we saw that and the United States in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seven days,</v>

375
00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.770
<v Speaker 1>terrible time with high inflation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>recessions.</v>

376
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:47.440
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as countries started to follow those</v>

377
00:21:47.441 --> 00:21:49.570
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things got better.</v>

378
00:21:49.571 --> 00:21:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And so in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now unfortunately have another piece</v>

379
00:21:52.571 --> 00:21:56.120
<v Speaker 1>of evidence that when policy deviated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:21:56.140 --> 00:22:00.010
<v Speaker 1>we had a big recession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually say the great moderation was</v>

381
00:22:00.011 --> 00:22:04.360
<v Speaker 1>ended by the great deviation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has led to this great recession.</v>

382
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to be very clear that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things happened that made this situation</v>

383
00:22:09.071 --> 00:22:11.230
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made that clear.</v>

384
00:22:11.231 --> 00:22:11.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

385
00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:12.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book,</v>

386
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:14.410
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting off track,</v>

387
00:22:14.411 --> 00:22:19.060
<v Speaker 1>that there was really three things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deviation from a monetary policy</v>

388
00:22:19.061 --> 00:22:22.150
<v Speaker 1>rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second was misdiagnosing the crisis</v>

389
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:26.980
<v Speaker 1>in the summer of 2007 as a liquidity</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem rather than a problem in the</v>

390
00:22:26.981 --> 00:22:29.250
<v Speaker 1>banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the third was this,</v>

391
00:22:29.251 --> 00:22:33.460
<v Speaker 1>this panic in the fall of 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>September,</v>

392
00:22:33.461 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 1>October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think was largely a result of</v>

393
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the rather chaotic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

394
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.060
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

395
00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.200
<v Speaker 1>responses to the crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

396
00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:43.630
<v Speaker 1>so the deviation was part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>

397
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:46.480
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are other deviations from</v>

398
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:49.360
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A deviations in the directions of a very</v>

399
00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.320
<v Speaker 1>interventionist policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdiagnoses,</v>

400
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.260
<v Speaker 1>which is really why this one has been so</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe.</v>

401
00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:57.453
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

402
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Good.</v>

403
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Our has it makes a good point with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the policy responses actually</v>

404
00:23:09.731 --> 00:23:14.350
<v Speaker 1>affect individual behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a what makes policy</v>

405
00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:17.530
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can take account of those</v>

406
00:23:17.531 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>and be wary of them and still have</v>
<v Speaker 1>conducted policy.</v>

407
00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:24.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

408
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:25.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

409
00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.860
<v Speaker 1>when bond traders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the markets have a sense of</v>

410
00:23:29.861 --> 00:23:34.510
<v Speaker 1>what monetary policy is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>liked and they will price securities,</v>

411
00:23:34.511 --> 00:23:36.150
<v Speaker 1>longer insecurities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medium rums,</v>

412
00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>securities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

413
00:23:37.721 --> 00:23:39.220
<v Speaker 1>based on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

414
00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:42.760
<v Speaker 1>if the policy moves to something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say for example,</v>

415
00:23:42.761 --> 00:23:45.130
<v Speaker 1>a deviates from what hadn't been</v>
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

416
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:47.780
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes them a while to figure out</v>

417
00:23:47.781 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they will adjust the,</v>

418
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:51.950
<v Speaker 1>adjust their forecast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their procedures,</v>

419
00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.340
<v Speaker 1>their rules of thumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes indirectly,</v>

420
00:23:55.341 --> 00:23:57.800
<v Speaker 1>sometimes somewhat in inadvertently</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do it.</v>

421
00:23:58.210 --> 00:23:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the adjustment.</v>

422
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:03.890
<v Speaker 1>But that's why we like our policies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be as predictable as possible.</v>

423
00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that people can make these</v>

424
00:24:05.931 --> 00:24:08.390
<v Speaker 1>adjustments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say this is,</v>

425
00:24:08.391 --> 00:24:13.391
<v Speaker 1>to me goodhart's law is another reason</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to be a changing from a policy</v>

426
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:17.570
<v Speaker 1>that's worked well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say not to do too much fine tuning</v>

427
00:24:17.571 --> 00:24:18.404
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

428
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 1>what Goodhart's law shows you is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts to,</v>

429
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.250
<v Speaker 1>to find tune can actually um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be uh,</v>

430
00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.700
<v Speaker 1>something that's it's harmful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

431
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I think the period in the early say 2002</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a period,</v>

432
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could very well be explained by an</v>

433
00:24:36.111 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 1>effort to make policy even better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was during the great moderation.</v>

434
00:24:39.921 --> 00:24:43.340
<v Speaker 1>If you like trying to find tune in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra way,</v>

435
00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.190
<v Speaker 1>bring rates below what had worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

436
00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:48.790
<v Speaker 1>those are all fine tuning things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

437
00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:53.720
<v Speaker 1>and I think what messages such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodhart's law show you is that the</v>

438
00:24:53.721 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 1>reaction to those can sometimes be hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to predict.</v>

439
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:00.350
<v Speaker 1>People will begin to see that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an,</v>

440
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.300
<v Speaker 1>there's another target does another</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

441
00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:05.450
<v Speaker 1>You're moving away from the equilibrium</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

442
00:25:05.451 --> 00:25:08.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's a reason I think to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple if you like,</v>

443
00:25:08.301 --> 00:25:11.720
<v Speaker 1>keep the policy as simple as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep the regulations as simple as</v>

444
00:25:11.721 --> 00:25:14.510
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's true of both monetary policy.</v>

445
00:25:14.511 --> 00:25:15.530
<v Speaker 1>And fiscal policy.</v>

446
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's several ways policy could have</v>

447
00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:27.210
<v Speaker 1>been more predictable in this crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think first of all,</v>

448
00:25:27.211 --> 00:25:31.770
<v Speaker 1>by sticking to the predictable policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that worked well in the eighties and</v>

449
00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:33.750
<v Speaker 1>nineties with respect to the setting of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rates,</v>

450
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.270
<v Speaker 1>that's something that I think we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of,</v>

451
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:39.270
<v Speaker 1>a lot of evidence for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The was unpredictable,</v>

452
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.900
<v Speaker 1>a surprise if he liked to take rates too</v>
<v Speaker 1>low for so long,</v>

453
00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:44.790
<v Speaker 1>even though there was an effort to</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain it.</v>

454
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

455
00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.440
<v Speaker 1>it was hard for people to understand how</v>
<v Speaker 1>long that was going to be.</v>

456
00:25:49.441 --> 00:25:52.830
<v Speaker 1>Was it a new policy of actual low</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rates or not?</v>

457
00:25:52.831 --> 00:25:56.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's an element of unpredictability</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think has caused damage.</v>

458
00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I think a second thing I would stress is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the response to the problems in the</v>

459
00:26:01.921 --> 00:26:03.960
<v Speaker 1>financial institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

460
00:26:03.961 --> 00:26:08.550
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdiagnosing it as a a liquidity</v>

461
00:26:08.551 --> 00:26:11.820
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So more liquidity was pumped into the</v>

462
00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:15.030
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new facilities were set up that added</v>

463
00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:18.510
<v Speaker 1>unpredictability rather than looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

464
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.290
<v Speaker 1>at the evidence that there was a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the banks due to the mortgages and</v>

465
00:26:22.291 --> 00:26:24.510
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other toxic assets.</v>

466
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.390
<v Speaker 1>And then I'd say the third element of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpredictability,</v>

467
00:26:27.391 --> 00:26:30.570
<v Speaker 1>it's probably the most important for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>severe panic.</v>

468
00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.180
<v Speaker 1>And I would go back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

469
00:26:33.181 --> 00:26:38.100
<v Speaker 1>the bear stearns intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take as a given,</v>

470
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:40.480
<v Speaker 1>although it's debatable that that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

471
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.040
<v Speaker 1>was the right thing to do and the heat</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the moment very difficult under</v>

472
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:47.100
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been in policy making jobs.</v>

473
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:49.560
<v Speaker 1>They know what that's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the decision was to,</v>

474
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene and bail out of bear stearns</v>

475
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 1>creditors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me at that that was the</v>

476
00:26:56.101 --> 00:27:01.101
<v Speaker 1>moment to be as clear as possible about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would be the policy in case another</v>

477
00:27:04.231 --> 00:27:07.480
<v Speaker 1>institution had some problems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate it,</v>

478
00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:10.860
<v Speaker 1>but it was very little description of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

479
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:14.730
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies tended to vary from case to</v>

480
00:27:14.731 --> 00:27:17.880
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had the Indian Mac at Wamu,</v>

481
00:27:17.881 --> 00:27:19.350
<v Speaker 1>you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

482
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:21.300
<v Speaker 1>the Lehman brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aig,</v>

483
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Fannie and Freddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In each case,</v>

484
00:27:23.341 --> 00:27:25.050
<v Speaker 1>there was a difference in each one.</v>

485
00:27:25.050 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Seemed to be approached independently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like,</v>

486
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:32.910
<v Speaker 1>ad hoc without an overall strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's probably the biggest degree of an</v>

487
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 1>unpredictability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equity Holders,</v>

488
00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>preferred equity holders,</v>

489
00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt holders,</v>

490
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:44.250
<v Speaker 1>bank holding company versus bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

491
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.800
<v Speaker 1>various kinds of senior creditors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterparties,</v>

492
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.760
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of uncertainty about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were going to be treated.</v>

493
00:27:51.761 --> 00:27:52.211
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

494
00:27:52.211 --> 00:27:54.210
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when all the ultimate,</v>

495
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:56.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy was put forth,</v>

496
00:27:56.881 --> 00:27:59.610
<v Speaker 1>the so called a tarp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

497
00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.950
<v Speaker 1>was put forth in a way which was quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing.</v>

498
00:28:01.951 --> 00:28:05.710
<v Speaker 1>The treasury secretary just had a two</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half pages,</v>

499
00:28:05.711 --> 00:28:07.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>testified with the chairman of the Fed</v>

500
00:28:07.861 --> 00:28:10.170
<v Speaker 1>and the Banking Committee and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

501
00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 1>couldn't answer in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions very well.</v>

502
00:28:13.981 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>Huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irate response from,</v>

503
00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:20.850
<v Speaker 1>from the congress at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really then became very clear,</v>

504
00:28:20.851 --> 00:28:23.940
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there wasn't really a policy.</v>

505
00:28:23.941 --> 00:28:27.810
<v Speaker 1>They had not been thinking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least as evidenced from the testimony</v>

506
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.860
<v Speaker 1>and the other actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was probably the most</v>

507
00:28:31.861 --> 00:28:34.950
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most damaging part of this whole</v>

508
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:35.784
<v Speaker 1>episode.</v>

509
00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.640
<v Speaker 1>This is a question about the timing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panic and whether it was associated</v>

510
00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:51.831
<v Speaker 1>with the Lehman brothers bankruptcy or</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the responses of the government</v>

511
00:28:54.721 --> 00:28:59.100
<v Speaker 1>more generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And basically as soon as that occurred,</v>

512
00:28:59.190 --> 00:29:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I looked at the data and I saw much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence that the panic and the markets</v>

513
00:29:04.651 --> 00:29:08.340
<v Speaker 1>were associated with the government's</v>
<v Speaker 1>responses or a week or 10 days later.</v>

514
00:29:08.341 --> 00:29:13.341
<v Speaker 1>That's the time that say the s and p 500</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell by a nearly 30%,</v>

515
00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.700
<v Speaker 1>very a 10 times greater than what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

516
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time of Lehman.</v>

517
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And p 500 was higher the Friday after</v>

518
00:29:22.621 --> 00:29:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the Lehman bankruptcy than the Friday</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

519
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.241
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

520
00:29:27.241 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of other data to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that shows you that there's as much</v>

521
00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.260
<v Speaker 1>more investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

522
00:29:32.261 --> 00:29:34.290
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

523
00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.080
<v Speaker 1>not one counterparty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

524
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:42.110
<v Speaker 1>driven of counterparty to Lehman filed</v>
<v Speaker 1>for bankruptcy after the Lehman case.</v>

525
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.713
<v Speaker 1>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

526
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:49.230
<v Speaker 1>the major creditors we did not fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to find a direct knock on</v>

527
00:29:49.661 --> 00:29:53.200
<v Speaker 1>effects from that in the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more I look at it,</v>

528
00:29:53.201 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>the more it seems to me there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other explanation,</v>

529
00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>

530
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Now I'd say now you need to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the counterfactual would have been.</v>

531
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:05.350
<v Speaker 1>And I guess I'd go back to something</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've stressed before,</v>

532
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:10.351
<v Speaker 1>that if there had been a clear policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>put forth whereby people could have</v>

533
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:16.891
<v Speaker 1>expected the possibility at least of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a leman being put through bankruptcy,</v>

534
00:30:18.341 --> 00:30:20.050
<v Speaker 1>then there could have been some</v>
<v Speaker 1>preparation.</v>

535
00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't any,</v>

536
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:24.350
<v Speaker 1>the day of the announcement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

537
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 1>in September of 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

538
00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:31.000
<v Speaker 1>people were just beginning to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how it work.</v>

539
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It was really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

540
00:30:32.501 --> 00:30:36.400
<v Speaker 1>a surprise that had been no preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was a jolt.</v>

541
00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's be sure it was a jolt.</v>

542
00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that the direct</v>

543
00:30:39.971 --> 00:30:43.840
<v Speaker 1>connections that people talk about with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expected cascading and domino</v>

544
00:30:43.841 --> 00:30:45.260
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

545
00:30:45.261 --> 00:30:48.010
<v Speaker 1>we're not there and it really occurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

546
00:30:48.011 --> 00:30:49.690
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more evidence for this.</v>

547
00:30:49.691 --> 00:30:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

548
00:30:50.861 --> 00:30:55.030
<v Speaker 1>John Cochran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luigi Zingales in Chicago have have put</v>

549
00:30:55.031 --> 00:30:58.360
<v Speaker 1>more out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the former FDAC chair,</v>

550
00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Isaac has studied it and comes to</v>

551
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:03.550
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of conclusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while,</v>

552
00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.970
<v Speaker 1>well it was originally controversial</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I put this idea of forth over a</v>

553
00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:11.380
<v Speaker 1>year ago actually in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a speech at the,</v>

554
00:31:11.381 --> 00:31:14.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank of Canada in November of 2008.</v>

555
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was viewed as controversial,</v>

556
00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:20.080
<v Speaker 1>but I just looking at the data then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more and more you look at what</v>

557
00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:23.110
<v Speaker 1>happened internally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to people and study,</v>

558
00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:26.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aftermath it seems to me there is at</v>

559
00:31:26.081 --> 00:31:28.330
<v Speaker 1>least as much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just put it evenly at least as</v>

560
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:33.331
<v Speaker 1>much evidence that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the panic was caused by the response as</v>

561
00:31:33.431 --> 00:31:37.180
<v Speaker 1>distinct from that particular event at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lehman Brothers.</v>

562
00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's more evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually becoming</v>

563
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:43.240
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming and looking at the data</v>
<v Speaker 1>carefully at um,</v>

564
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.720
<v Speaker 1>spreads in the markets at what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to the equity markets and also</v>

565
00:31:49.061 --> 00:31:51.940
<v Speaker 1>looking at what's happened in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of the bankruptcy of Lehman</v>

566
00:31:51.941 --> 00:31:53.050
<v Speaker 1>brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the kinds of,</v>

567
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:58.051
<v Speaker 1>he like nitty gritty details that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be studying to understand what</v>

568
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:01.210
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing that work here at Stanford,</v>

569
00:32:01.211 --> 00:32:03.910
<v Speaker 1>at the Hoover Institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of focus on,</v>

570
00:32:03.911 --> 00:32:06.800
<v Speaker 1>and we have a whole working group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's delving until we're talking.</v>

571
00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:09.130
<v Speaker 1>We've talked to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former policy makers,</v>

572
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:13.720
<v Speaker 1>and also people in the private sector to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to understand this and match it up</v>

573
00:32:13.721 --> 00:32:16.270
<v Speaker 1>with the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the most important</v>

574
00:32:16.271 --> 00:32:19.210
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now come to some conclusion about what</v>

575
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:24.211
<v Speaker 1>actually happened so that we can then</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the appropriate remedies reforms to</v>

576
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:25.900
<v Speaker 1>make sure it doesn't happen again.</v>

577
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Why have I disapproved of the stimulus</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

578
00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:38.920
<v Speaker 1>the like large countercyclical a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keynesian policies?</v>

579
00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Because I don't think we have ever had</v>
<v Speaker 1>much evidence that they work.</v>

580
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:48.131
<v Speaker 1>And so let me draw it to be specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first stimulus was in early 2008 and</v>

581
00:32:49.581 --> 00:32:54.581
<v Speaker 1>that was largely in the form of one time</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebate check sent to individuals.</v>

582
00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.020
<v Speaker 1>A lot of money went out and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

583
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.860
<v Speaker 1>eat basic economic theory would tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that would not jumpstart</v>

584
00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would save most of that.</v>

585
00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.830
<v Speaker 1>So unlike what was advertised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

586
00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:10.370
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't stimulate the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

587
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 1>if you go back and look at it carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the numbers as I've done,</v>

588
00:33:15.111 --> 00:33:19.100
<v Speaker 1>you don't see an impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that big rebate just Wen to</v>

589
00:33:19.101 --> 00:33:22.220
<v Speaker 1>people's pockets and didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't dot John Stark consumption.</v>

590
00:33:22.221 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption's going the other way at</v>

591
00:33:24.711 --> 00:33:28.430
<v Speaker 1>that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you had the stimulus of a 2009</v>

592
00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.120
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that that was based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>sending checks to people,</v>

593
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:36.020
<v Speaker 1>you see exactly the same thing happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>one time payments,</v>

594
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>temporary,</v>

595
00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:40.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax cuts don't stimulate,</v>

596
00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending or consumption.</v>

597
00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.930
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we knew that for years and years and</v>

598
00:33:44.931 --> 00:33:47.360
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why policy and most of the</v>

599
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.850
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties didn't take those</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of approaches.</v>

600
00:33:49.851 --> 00:33:53.270
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then that brings you to the question</v>

601
00:33:53.271 --> 00:33:56.720
<v Speaker 1>about government purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can that be more effective?</v>

602
00:33:56.721 --> 00:33:57.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

603
00:33:57.171 --> 00:34:00.350
<v Speaker 1>in principle it can be if it's timed</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

604
00:34:00.351 --> 00:34:02.930
<v Speaker 1>if it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's done in time,</v>

605
00:34:02.931 --> 00:34:07.880
<v Speaker 1>but this stimulus package of 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government purchases part of it is</v>

606
00:34:07.881 --> 00:34:12.080
<v Speaker 1>spread out over a long period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them haven't even come in line</v>

607
00:34:12.081 --> 00:34:14.000
<v Speaker 1>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government purchases side.</v>

608
00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:18.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't see that that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulating the economy.</v>

609
00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:23.030
<v Speaker 1>The rebound in the economy has been to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do to things like inventory changes,</v>

610
00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:26.930
<v Speaker 1>recognition that the panic is over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

611
00:34:26.931 --> 00:34:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and investment side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

612
00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.850
<v Speaker 1>so you can find the impacts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

613
00:34:31.851 --> 00:34:36.851
<v Speaker 1>it's unfortunate because that means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got a huge increase in our debt,</v>

614
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:38.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

615
00:34:38.601 --> 00:34:40.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's ultimately harmful.</v>

616
00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.280
<v Speaker 1>We didn't get much out of it in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>stimulus.</v>

617
00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:44.780
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced,</v>

618
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I like to do is not just look at</v>

619
00:34:46.881 --> 00:34:49.040
<v Speaker 1>the models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

620
00:34:49.041 --> 00:34:53.630
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at a new keynesian model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at a model I built many years</v>

621
00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.190
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at other people's models,</v>

622
00:34:55.550 --> 00:35:00.550
<v Speaker 1>and they're good for assessing impacts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately what we need to do now</v>

623
00:35:00.561 --> 00:35:03.320
<v Speaker 1>that we've had these packages is to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what happened.</v>

624
00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:05.960
<v Speaker 1>You go away from the models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at what happened.</v>

625
00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Did Jumpstart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did consumption get jumpstarted?</v>

626
00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I say no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the recovery due to the stimulus?</v>

627
00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:14.540
<v Speaker 1>It seems not because it was in the form</v>
<v Speaker 1>of investment.</v>

628
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

629
00:35:15.890 --> 00:35:20.030
<v Speaker 1>so I think ultimately we can learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this experience.</v>

630
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:25.090
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly why we moved away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the policies that we're working,</v>

631
00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 1>which is really an aversion to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>large countercyclical policies.</v>

632
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:34.750
<v Speaker 1>It began in the early 2008 and I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>continued and it may continue further.</v>

633
00:35:34.941 --> 00:35:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think let's start learning from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

634
00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:42.060
<v Speaker 1>and not be ideological about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not consider what school is one in,</v>

635
00:35:42.061 --> 00:35:44.670
<v Speaker 1>but looked at the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I look at the facts,</v>

636
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:46.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't see much impact of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>

637
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I would say the responsibility of Wall</v>
<v Speaker 1>Street in this crisis and it still</v>

638
00:35:54.991 --> 00:35:59.010
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the dependence on the financial</v>

639
00:35:59.011 --> 00:36:01.110
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

640
00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:05.430
<v Speaker 1>on the government for a bailout and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interventions.</v>

641
00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:09.900
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutions had become large enough</v>

642
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:10.950
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

643
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:15.900
<v Speaker 1>and complicated enough that at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>that led people to say we needed to have</v>

644
00:36:15.901 --> 00:36:16.734
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

645
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:18.570
<v Speaker 1>these bailouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these interventions.</v>

646
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Each time it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

647
00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.040
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people said to be systemic risk.</v>

648
00:36:23.041 --> 00:36:24.600
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

649
00:36:24.601 --> 00:36:28.380
<v Speaker 1>calling saying there's a fire in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater crying fire in a theater.</v>

650
00:36:28.381 --> 00:36:32.360
<v Speaker 1>And it led to these responses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I say we're quite chaotic and,</v>

651
00:36:32.361 --> 00:36:33.960
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not systematic.</v>

652
00:36:33.961 --> 00:36:37.110
<v Speaker 1>They really led to problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think what has to happen in the</v>

653
00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 1>future as Wall Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the large firms have to find a way to</v>

654
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:41.700
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

655
00:36:41.701 --> 00:36:44.420
<v Speaker 1>we are not going to depend on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government for bail out,</v>

656
00:36:44.450 --> 00:36:47.940
<v Speaker 1>just like a startup firm out here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley.</v>

657
00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.190
<v Speaker 1>If it fails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be bailed out by the</v>

658
00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:52.650
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same should be true for the large</v>

659
00:36:52.651 --> 00:36:54.960
<v Speaker 1>financial institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should find a way to do that.</v>

660
00:36:54.961 --> 00:36:58.320
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me some sense they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for doing that.</v>

661
00:36:58.530 --> 00:37:02.790
<v Speaker 1>They want to be responsible citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think in the meantime,</v>

662
00:37:02.830 --> 00:37:07.170
<v Speaker 1>government needs to find a way for it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of this a bailout business.</v>

663
00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.390
<v Speaker 1>There's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

664
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

665
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.820
<v Speaker 1>point to where this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

666
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 1>there has been a change in the 1990s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The IMF,</v>

667
00:37:15.870 --> 00:37:17.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a lot of bailouts.</v>

668
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States participated in some of</v>

669
00:37:19.831 --> 00:37:23.220
<v Speaker 1>those and pays a Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it got quite chaotic.</v>

670
00:37:23.221 --> 00:37:25.920
<v Speaker 1>And the case of US Southeast Asia</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

671
00:37:25.921 --> 00:37:27.850
<v Speaker 1>they were sometimes and sometimes not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

672
00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.480
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in for a while and they pulled</v>

673
00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.950
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course we had a lot of contagent</v>

674
00:37:32.951 --> 00:37:37.400
<v Speaker 1>and a globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't until maybe 2002,</v>

675
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.120
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a,</v>

676
00:37:39.121 --> 00:37:42.630
<v Speaker 1>the policy became more predictable and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more understandable.</v>

677
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.340
<v Speaker 1>The IMF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

678
00:37:44.490 --> 00:37:46.530
<v Speaker 1>let out some procedures that are called</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

679
00:37:46.531 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 1>the exceptional access framework and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarified what their operations would</v>

680
00:37:50.791 --> 00:37:53.010
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the expectation of a,</v>

681
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:56.310
<v Speaker 1>of a bailout out of a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

682
00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:58.860
<v Speaker 1>sovereign debt was reduced</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>

683
00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think you saw a huge improvement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the emerging markets.</v>

684
00:38:02.401 --> 00:38:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Some of them made an extra effort to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build up their reserve.</v>

685
00:38:06.151 --> 00:38:07.980
<v Speaker 1>Some of them they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So their deficits,</v>

686
00:38:07.981 --> 00:38:11.460
<v Speaker 1>they made the adjustments and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they'd been stronger as a result.</v>

687
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that shows you what can happen if</v>

688
00:38:13.711 --> 00:38:17.760
<v Speaker 1>the policy of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes more predictable and less,</v>

689
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:21.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected bailouts or in the system.</v>
