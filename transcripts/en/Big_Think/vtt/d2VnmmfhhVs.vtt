1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Watching children in early adolescence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in adolescence is,</v>

2
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.880
<v Speaker 1>is always eternally heartbreaking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults.</v>

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>There was a great article in the Times</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine about Christmas maybe 20 years</v>

4
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:17.390
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the power of the Christmas mystery</v>

5
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:22.391
<v Speaker 1>is when you look at a child the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know in the story that the</v>

6
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Virgin Mary looked at her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at her new son,</v>

7
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>the Christ child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thought simultaneously this child</v>

8
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>might save the world and he's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

9
00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this like huge amount of hope we have</v>

10
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.310
<v Speaker 1>for our children and this terror that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to die.</v>

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>If my mother looked at me at 13 if she</v>
<v Speaker 1>read my diaries about how eagerly I want</v>

12
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>it to be popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would sound very like someone cording</v>

13
00:00:48.201 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>likes on instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 1>I knew if my outfit didn't go over well</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I knew the way that a 13 year old</v>

15
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>might not post a foe might pull down a</v>
<v Speaker 1>photograph if it on Instagram,</v>

16
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>if it doesn't get enough likes not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wear that again.</v>

17
00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or I decided not to wear that again</v>

18
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>because being liked was the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing in the world to me at</v>

19
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>that age and for a reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how you're going to</v>

20
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>play in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how to be in the world,</v>

21
00:01:13.371 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>how does show up in the world and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>testing and learning what works for you.</v>

22
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's heartbreaking.</v>

23
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It's heartbreaking when people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you or invite you to a party.</v>

24
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>And similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's heartbreaking,</v>

25
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you don't get the response you</v>

26
00:01:27.591 --> 00:01:31.820
<v Speaker 1>crave online or you get a response</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's out of proportion to what you</v>

27
00:01:31.821 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

28
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>taking the risk of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just take the simple,</v>

29
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram brings up fears of narcissism</v>

30
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 1>because we're in heyday of self</v>
<v Speaker 1>portraiture,</v>

31
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>which we've been in before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been other times where</v>

32
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>sat for portraits or painted themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

34
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>van Gogh's self portrait is rarely</v>
<v Speaker 1>regarded as an it work of narcissism.</v>

35
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>But let's say that we have this popular</v>
<v Speaker 1>form that as these self portraits,</v>

36
00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>staging them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking the photograph,</v>

37
00:02:00.861 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>taking many photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing the right photograph,</v>

38
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>cropping it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coloring it,</v>

39
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>and then distributing it immediately to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:02:09.621 --> 00:02:14.621
<v Speaker 1>this giant gallery space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then like every artist trying to see</v>

41
00:02:14.631 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>who buys it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to see who's interested in it,</v>

42
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>trying to see if it sells and trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what kind of commentary they get on</v>

43
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>you know a lot of people who post self</v>
<v Speaker 1>portraits,</v>

45
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>and this was true in the early days of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube with musicians are actually</v>

46
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.230
<v Speaker 1>looking for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases for critical feedback.</v>

47
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the hot or not thing that where</v>

48
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>you put photographs were posted and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could decide I like,</v>

49
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.000
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also plays on the right and left</v>

51
00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.030
<v Speaker 1>swipe of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tinder is sometimes what recording.</v>

52
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Like does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does this work?</v>

53
00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Beta right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know it.</v>

54
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Do I talk loud enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I talk too loud?</v>

55
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you know that credible self</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of like,</v>

56
00:02:53.571 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>are my bangs a little too short?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are My eyes big enough or,</v>

57
00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I inhabit this body I'm in and</v>

58
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.150
<v Speaker 1>be an fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The exigencies of social life fit the</v>

59
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>exigencies of a party or a workspace or</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way opt out of it.</v>

60
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are plenty of,</v>

61
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>of of kids who are dialing back and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see among millennials are return to flip</v>

62
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.940
<v Speaker 1>phones or to abstinence from computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Internet.</v>

64
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's very interesting.</v>

65
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>The last thing I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 1>when you talk about teaching my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids,</v>

67
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I feel very strongly that we can't adopt</v>
<v Speaker 1>a true love waits abstinence program</v>

68
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:31.810
<v Speaker 1>about screens.</v>

69
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>The idea is not to teach your kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>never go to parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never live in social space,</v>

71
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>avoid other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like learning to live in digital</v>

72
00:03:42.881 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>space is not unlike learning to live in</v>
<v Speaker 1>social space.</v>

73
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's what kids want help doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

74
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>I remember my mother teaching me this</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly subtle social lesson,</v>

75
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>which is when you're describing a party</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you went to,</v>

76
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>but another friend didn't get invited</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

77
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>don't say the party was terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't say they missed nothing.</v>

78
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't say it was awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's disingenuous.</v>

79
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair to the host and it's</v>

80
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>condescending to the person you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to.</v>

81
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 1>Anything that you were left out of was</v>
<v Speaker 1>awful.</v>

82
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

83
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I metabolize that lesson.</v>

84
00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember it was a sleep over and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight years old.</v>

85
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Those are the kind of lessons you teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>your kids online.</v>

86
00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to be the kind of person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that posts a topless shot on instagram?</v>

87
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has certain requirements that's</v>

88
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.820
<v Speaker 1>going to have certain consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go through what those consequences</v>

89
00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:32.260
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

90
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to be posted in all caps?</v>

91
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you gonna use twitter a lot or you</v>

92
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>can use pinterest a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you use pinterest,</v>

93
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:42.310
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to use it for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the buy button about?</v>

94
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much are you using this as to tee up</v>

95
00:04:45.071 --> 00:04:47.740
<v Speaker 1>purchases and what are you going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that debt?</v>

96
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to afford those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

97
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do with the part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Internet that shows your credit</v>

98
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 1>card debt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say these are experiences that coach</v>

99
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.030
<v Speaker 1>ought to be embraced with confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>to be embraced with confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as though the party,</v>

101
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city streets,</v>

102
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>the whatever are simply terrifying.</v>

103
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing to do is lock your</v>
<v Speaker 1>door against them.</v>

104
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.930
<v Speaker 1>But to show up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

105
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:12.283
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

106
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.180
<v Speaker 1>the women I know got advice from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother that's too much black eyeliner,</v>

107
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's too much hair dye,</v>

108
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:19.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting,</v>

109
00:05:19.781 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I pierced my ear the</v>

110
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:23.500
<v Speaker 1>second time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother said that's prelude to getting</v>

111
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 1>a tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't agree with her.</v>

112
00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't agree with her.</v>

113
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>I decided to that I would do it anyway</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where a secondary thing in that ear</v>

114
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>and that was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there are certain things that you</v>

115
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 1>say to your kid like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>my son just chose his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his uh,</v>

117
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>his g-mail name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

118
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>And he decided to use his whole name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his first middle and last name</v>

119
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>because it showed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 1>no one else had it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a lot of letters to type in.</v>

121
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>He's the got along name to type into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gmail all this time and I asked him,</v>

122
00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>you may have lifetime of signing into</v>
<v Speaker 1>things with your Gmail address.</v>

123
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you really want to be typing all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those letters?</v>

124
00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>He said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he chose his avatar for Google,</v>

125
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>he took a million pictures of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's 10 years old and he opted to have</v>

126
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>one of those executive pictures leaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back for lots of like authority and</v>

127
00:06:12.651 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Alpha maleness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I asked him,</v>

128
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.930
<v Speaker 1>you're 10 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you want to be like a little cuter</v>

129
00:06:17.931 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>and more childlike?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

130
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going with the executive picture.</v>

131
00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>And that was a good strategic decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>for him.</v>

132
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I think a good artistic decision for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

133
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowering our kids to think like</v>

134
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.730
<v Speaker 1>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think like writers to think like</v>

135
00:06:31.731 --> 00:06:34.610
<v Speaker 1>novelists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are creating an Avatar online.</v>

136
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't necessarily want to be some</v>

137
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Pollyanna Avatar who only posts great</v>
<v Speaker 1>things about her life.</v>

138
00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.530
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you do or do you show up all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>

139
00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Vaguebooking and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and writing sad sack posts and talking,</v>

140
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really vulnerably like a memoirist</v>

141
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:53.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those are choices that have</v>

143
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's at that level of detail.</v>

144
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all do it in our lives with facebook</v>

145
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That level of detail you teach kids.</v>
