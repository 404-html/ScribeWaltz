1
00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the really scary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming things about terrorism can</v>

2
00:00:09.491 --> 00:00:14.491
<v Speaker 1>be the idea that it's this giant Boogie</v>
<v Speaker 1>man that is really difficult to</v>

3
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:19.330
<v Speaker 1>comprehend and is terrifying and comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>along in the night out of nowhere and</v>

4
00:00:19.331 --> 00:00:21.880
<v Speaker 1>steals your family members or loved ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

5
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life's work has really been</v>

6
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>understanding the small logical puzzle</v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces that when taken together create</v>

7
00:00:34.091 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>that man so that you can take it apart</v>
<v Speaker 1>into manageable pieces and actually</v>

8
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>begin to understand what drives these</v>
<v Speaker 1>inconceivable actions.</v>

9
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.830
<v Speaker 1>So when you take this overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 1>boogie man of terrorism and you begin to</v>

10
00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>tease it apart based on the data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>look for patterns,</v>

11
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the turnoff again and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each time a terrorist plot is planned in</v>

12
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>a different territory throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical data,</v>

13
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you begin to notice patterns that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not seem obvious to begin with.</v>

14
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 1>So things like the percentage beneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>livable wage that a border guard gets</v>

15
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 1>paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course gives rise to the</v>

16
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:15.811
<v Speaker 1>possibility of accepting a bribe to let</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody just sneak across the border or</v>

17
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>hand to package to you if that bribe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the difference between being able to</v>

18
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>feed your kids that months or not.</v>

19
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty understandable small</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice for that individual actor and yet</v>

20
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>has given rise to perhaps a terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>act to being able to take place even</v>

21
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>though the law of the territory should</v>
<v Speaker 1>have prevented it.</v>

22
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Another example would be the rate of</v>
<v Speaker 1>change of things like freedom of the</v>

23
00:01:42.521 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>press or freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the scores themselves,</v>

24
00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>but the rate of change which goes to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficulty that society's experience</v>

25
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 1>when they suddenly open up and allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties that many of the more</v>

26
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:57.370
<v Speaker 1>traditional members of society haven't</v>
<v Speaker 1>been accustomed to in the past.</v>

27
00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>There are strategies for taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities through those evolutions.</v>

28
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>But without those strategies in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can seem very jarring.</v>

29
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And we experienced that even in a mature</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy like ours where when certain</v>

30
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 1>changes take place quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can take portions of the community</v>

31
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.250
<v Speaker 1>time to be comfortable with them and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>catch up in a political environment.</v>

32
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another example would be the ratio of</v>

33
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.960
<v Speaker 1>who Kabar is to Madrasa was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there you begin to see,</v>

34
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions between more traditional</v>

35
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>religious elements in society and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger demographic in many countries</v>

36
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.220
<v Speaker 1>where you have more than 50% in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth demographic.</v>

37
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>There's a big cultural rift there that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can often give rise to lack of</v>

38
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:51.040
<v Speaker 1>understanding or the feeling that young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not being incorporated into</v>

39
00:02:51.041 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 1>society and need some other outlet for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>for their feelings of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of frustration.</v>

41
00:02:57.581 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eventually,</v>

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another really interesting one that we</v>

43
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:07.201
<v Speaker 1>see is how good machine translation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a local language.</v>

44
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>So often we think that libraries in in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the olden days and and now the provision</v>

45
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:19.610
<v Speaker 1>of hardware and Internet access points</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be a great uh,</v>

46
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>tool in the fight against extremism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden young people in a given</v>

47
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>area have access to the sum total of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human knowledge.</v>

48
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>How great is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet if the language that's spoken,</v>

49
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the dialect in that region is not very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well translated by Google translator or</v>

50
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>other artificial intelligence programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then really access to the Internet for</v>

51
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>the majority of young people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily speak another language or</v>

52
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:49.201
<v Speaker 1>dialect is not terribly meaningful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're generally seeing sights</v>

53
00:03:50.111 --> 00:03:55.111
<v Speaker 1>that for small dialect are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>created in their vicinity and may not</v>

54
00:03:56.291 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>offer perspectives that are particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from what they're hearing</v>

55
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 1>around them in a given day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are a number of these</v>

56
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>correlations and the beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>my dad's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an economist and I grew up in a</v>

58
00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>household that loved throwing data</v>
<v Speaker 1>around around the dinner table.</v>

59
00:04:12.161 --> 00:04:17.161
<v Speaker 1>And the beauty of data is that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at huge sets across many different</v>

60
00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>time periods and geographies and see</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns that emerged so starkly that</v>

61
00:04:24.941 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't ignore them.</v>

62
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of inputs are really helpful</v>
<v Speaker 1>in understanding how regular human</v>

63
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:35.851
<v Speaker 1>beings like you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who grew up in different environments,</v>

64
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>subject to different inputs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could find themselves with different</v>

65
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:41.530
<v Speaker 1>perspectives about what's happening in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

66
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And eventually if their perspectives go</v>
<v Speaker 1>unheard,</v>

67
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>feel increasing frustration that</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually can find its outlet in a</v>

68
00:04:50.681 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>violent way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>what's one of the things that I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting outside of those just</v>

70
00:04:55.841 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>being intellectually interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the practical applications of</v>

71
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:05.311
<v Speaker 1>that kind of study is to see where there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are easy,</v>

72
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.560
<v Speaker 1>cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient ways to make,</v>

73
00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a disproportionately big impact in</v>

74
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.891
<v Speaker 1>portions of the world where instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>launching a kind of nebulous</v>

75
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 1>multimillion dollar program that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not going to hit the milestones that</v>

76
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:26.140
<v Speaker 1>it's intending to hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go in with a very surgical and</v>

77
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:31.141
<v Speaker 1>efficient programs and make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately large impact in the</v>

78
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>lives of the people living in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>regions.</v>

79
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
