1
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Variety choice at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

2
00:00:12.581 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that we're growing are</v>

3
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>basically dependent on what will grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in,</v>

4
00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 1>in our ecosystem again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:20.511
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:25.070
<v Speaker 1>we're basically getting seeds that</v>
<v Speaker 1>either are from the same latitude around</v>

7
00:00:25.071 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>the world or from seeds that we know</v>
<v Speaker 1>have grown here in the past.</v>

8
00:00:28.701 --> 00:00:29.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

9
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>right now we're growing a type of corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.913
<v Speaker 1>called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>eight row flint corn now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight row flint corn.</v>

12
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did an experiment,</v>

13
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>some guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy guy from North Carolina who's</v>

14
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.400
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with saving seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid us a,</v>

15
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.420
<v Speaker 1>paid our farmer Jack $2,000 to plant it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 75 of these,</v>

16
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 1>these corn corn plants of eight row</v>
<v Speaker 1>flint corn.</v>

17
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it was a,</v>

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>it was the most popular corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.530
<v Speaker 1>among the native American Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they used to prize it for its</v>

20
00:01:03.531 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>ability to dry and feed a feed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes during the,</v>

21
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.113
<v Speaker 1>during the winter.</v>

22
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And so jack and I was very skeptical</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this would germinate at all.</v>

23
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

24
00:01:15.231 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>we got 99 percent germination and we got</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible corn now we harvested it.</v>

25
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>And just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is out of,</v>

26
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you write this into a novel,</v>

27
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just not to be believed,</v>

28
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but we harvest the next day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next day I'm reading this,</v>

29
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brochure from a very famous,</v>

30
00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>marketplace and actually Michigan that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sells wholesale and retail around the</v>

32
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I opened up to like the middle of</v>

33
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pamphlet and,</v>

34
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

35
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>the most famous Italian placenta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now have it on sale oto feel a from</v>

36
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Italy and Oto feel a translate is eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>row flint corn.</v>

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.500
<v Speaker 1>So it's the Italians that recognized</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Indians this incredible core</v>

38
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:04.250
<v Speaker 1>and that could make this unbelievable</v>
<v Speaker 1>polenta took it from us,</v>

39
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>preserved it while we in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States have completely lost that except</v>

40
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>really for the seeds that we had growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ended up Germany.</v>

41
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little.</v>

42
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.540
<v Speaker 1>He paid some other farmers to grow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really germinate well,</v>

43
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:18.890
<v Speaker 1>but we are preserving what is our</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural heritage in our natural ecology.</v>

44
00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I was going to ne was</v>

45
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>what's corn country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>for the native Indians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the Italians recognize this,</v>

47
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds of years ago and</v>

48
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>have preserved it over these small</v>
<v Speaker 1>family farms.</v>

49
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

50
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things.</v>

51
00:02:31.411 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we grind our own Polenta,</v>

52
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like back into the turn of the</v>

53
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're like a well Miller and we grind</v>

55
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>our own plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we make this unbelievably flavorful?</v>

56
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Belie that people cannot taste it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like,</v>

57
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.370
<v Speaker 1>they've never tasted polenta and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

58
00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have this stuff now,</v>

59
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>now it's really great point that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question I gave you a ball right now.</v>

60
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>You would flip out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good because you're really</v>

61
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:55.700
<v Speaker 1>tasting things that have been hybridized</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it.</v>

62
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.610
<v Speaker 1>flavors and oils and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the German,</v>

64
00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff are incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also by the way,</v>

65
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>it's more helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

66
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Our research is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in that germ,</v>

67
00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>in that oils are a lot of micronutrients</v>
<v Speaker 1>that totally brought out over the course</v>

68
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of generations.</v>

69
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I tell that story about this wacky</v>

70
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>dude at Beta $2,000 and the native</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans and autofill April flicker,</v>

71
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>and the response in the dining room is</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if you've just given them,</v>

72
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret to life,</v>

73
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're tasting now all of a</v>

74
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.271
<v Speaker 1>sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:30.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're tasting Italy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tradition and all this stuff that,</v>

76
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.530
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the tradition of Italy is based</v>

77
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>actually on America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like all the things that just</v>

78
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>like totally drank the koolaid right</v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

79
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's great.</v>

80
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Polenta is no question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's much better because I have that</v>

81
00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:46.090
<v Speaker 1>story that we can relate to everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that makes me look like a better</v>

82
00:03:46.091 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>chef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>even in my best days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't lack an ego.</v>

84
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm not having an ego like the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chefs,</v>

85
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.120
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

86
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I cannot cook as well as those stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make people taste things they</v>

87
00:03:57.671 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>otherwise wouldn't taste the seasoning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just priceless.</v>

88
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>So I like to get more of those stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>in self interest because it makes my</v>

89
00:04:04.871 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>food taste.</v>

90
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
