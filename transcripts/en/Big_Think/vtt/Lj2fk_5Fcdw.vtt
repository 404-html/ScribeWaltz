1
00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:00.843
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 2>so when we think about democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's kind of a real</v>

3
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 2>interesting opportunity to think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is participatory democracy in the</v>

4
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 2>modern connected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>connected world and I think there's all</v>

5
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 2>kinds of versions that are much better</v>
<v Speaker 2>than the vote every two years kind of</v>

6
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 2>version that we have right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

7
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:32.791
<v Speaker 2>does a lovely experiment that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if people got to vote on,</v>

8
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.370
<v Speaker 2>we're five percent of their income tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes to.</v>

9
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 2>So you will get the list of all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>things the government does,</v>

10
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is actually already a good thing</v>

11
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 2>because people don't know what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government does.</v>

12
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 2>We went at some point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to the Chapel Hill Public</v>

13
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 2>Library and we ask people when was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>last time you got benefit from tax</v>

14
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>payers money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>People couldn't remember when was the</v>

15
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>last time and they were in a public</v>
<v Speaker 2>library funded by taxpayers money.</v>

16
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't really understand what the</v>

17
00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 2>government does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

18
00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 2>what taxes go for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you've got a list of all the</v>

19
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.620
<v Speaker 2>things the government does and you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide five percent,</v>

20
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably don't want people to</v>

21
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:16.570
<v Speaker 2>allocate all of their income tax because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some things that the government</v>

22
00:01:16.571 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 2>needs to worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but doing some kind of marginal</v>

23
00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:21.550
<v Speaker 2>contribution and thinking where we want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

24
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 2>I think would get people to be more</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved,</v>

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.080
<v Speaker 2>care more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at waste.</v>

26
00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I think it will make government officers</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit more accountable.</v>

27
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 2>So that's one version where I think we</v>
<v Speaker 2>could get participatory democracy to be</v>

28
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 2>closer to what we wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to be.</v>

29
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.490
<v Speaker 2>And another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another kind of direction is to say why</v>

30
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 2>do we need to vote for one person?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

31
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine that we will have a voting</v>

32
00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Speaker 2>procedure.</v>

33
00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 2>We would say you could say I want then</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ben really to vote for me on any issues</v>

34
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 2>that has to do with education and</v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

35
00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 2>but not about a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

36
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>space exploration and not about a</v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear activities.</v>

37
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 2>You can imagine all of society is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>network of people and you can assign</v>

38
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 2>your vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just to the representatives,</v>

39
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 2>but you could assign your votes to other</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in society where you could say,</v>

40
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

41
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.180
<v Speaker 2>then I trust you or those topics you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could vote for me and I can trust</v>

42
00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:26.260
<v Speaker 2>somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on.</v>

43
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>So we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could create a network in which we</v>

44
00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.570
<v Speaker 2>trust different people for different</v>
<v Speaker 2>subtopics and not have this idea that is</v>

45
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:41.900
<v Speaker 2>one person who is representing us is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the right person for all,</v>

46
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 2>all topics around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

47
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.130
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's one.</v>

48
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 2>The other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other,</v>

49
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:53.530
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big issue.</v>

50
00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you saw this,</v>

51
00:02:55.331 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 2>but we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need it,</v>

52
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.770
<v Speaker 2>although studies about how people want</v>
<v Speaker 2>society to be designed.</v>

53
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>So originally we did it on inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial inequality,</v>

54
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 2>but then we moved to other areas as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

55
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 2>but in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial inequality.</v>

56
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 2>And we ask people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

57
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 2>what they understand about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution of wealth in the US.</v>

58
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 2>So we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if we took all the people in the</v>

59
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>US from the cruise to the riches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We broke them into five buckets,</v>

60
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>the 20 percent richest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent less,</v>

61
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 2>less,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than the poorest,</v>

62
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 2>and we asked you from the 100 percent</v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth total time how much is allocated</v>

63
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 2>right now to each of those five buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people think that the bottom two</v>

64
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 2>buckets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom 40 percent of Americans own</v>

65
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>about nine percent of the wealth when in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact they own about zero point three,</v>

66
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

67
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

68
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 2>this slope is what's called the Gini</v>
<v Speaker 2>Coefficient.</v>

69
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>The rate of inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People know the rich have.</v>

70
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 2>American don't understand how much</v>

71
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>little the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poor half.</v>

72
00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 2>And then we also ask them what would you</v>
<v Speaker 2>like society to be?</v>

73
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 2>And we use a John Roles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you remember John Rawls had this</v>

74
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 2>interesting idea that he said a just</v>
<v Speaker 2>society is a society that if you knew</v>

75
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 2>everything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will be willing to join it in a</v>

76
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 2>random place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're very rich,</v>

77
00:04:17.471 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 2>you might want society that treats the</v>
<v Speaker 2>regionalized and the not so nice.</v>

78
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>If you're very poor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might want the other way around,</v>

79
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 2>but if you don't know where you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be allocated after the fact.</v>

80
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 2>You have to consider all perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he called this developer ignorance</v>

81
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 2>because you choose before you know where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be.</v>

82
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.210
<v Speaker 2>So we described the veil of ignorance to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of people and we say,</v>

83
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 2>what kind of society would you like to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create?</v>

84
00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.330
<v Speaker 2>And Americans created a society that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>more equal than Sweden,</v>

85
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>not perfectly equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants socialism,</v>

86
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 2>but much more equal than than Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

87
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 2>the differences between Republicans and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats were tiny.</v>

88
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republicans want in slightly more</v>

89
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrats won in slightly more equality,</v>

90
00:04:57.821 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 2>but it was small difference compared to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gap between what we have and what</v>

91
00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 2>people want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another way to think about</v>

92
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 2>democracy in the modern world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

93
00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say that we could vote on a</v>

94
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:15.541
<v Speaker 2>topic like we could vote on whether we</v>
<v Speaker 2>want Obama's healthcare version.</v>

95
00:05:15.911 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one approach.</v>

96
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.560
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to vote on that as individual,</v>

97
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 2>just way too complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this plan is,</v>

98
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>includes so much.</v>

99
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.910
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to be experts on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the time to really read</v>

100
00:05:27.911 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 2>the whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000 pages of this plan.</v>

101
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 2>What what we could do is we could vote</v>
<v Speaker 2>on our principles,</v>

102
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 2>on how we want society to be right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not about the concrete aspects,</v>

103
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.720
<v Speaker 2>but on what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are the guiding principles of</v>

104
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.540
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much we care about equality and how</v>

105
00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 2>much we care about access to health and</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to vote on something concrete,</v>

106
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:57.230
<v Speaker 2>but to vote on it in terms of what are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principles we believe in and then it</v>

107
00:05:57.231 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>will be the job of the politicians to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take our principles and translate them</v>

108
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:06.080
<v Speaker 2>into policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about something like investment.</v>

109
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 2>If you go to a an investment</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional to help you,</v>

110
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>they don't ask you what stocks you want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to invest in.</v>

111
00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.150
<v Speaker 2>That's their job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What they ask you is what can I firstly</v>

112
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.003
<v Speaker 2>want to take?</v>

113
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>How much money do you want to give to</v>
<v Speaker 2>charity?</v>

114
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 2>They ask you again of the general</v>
<v Speaker 2>principles about life and then they go</v>

115
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:27.731
<v Speaker 2>ahead and figure how those principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>are going to be played out in the</v>

116
00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>details and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's another kind of interesting</v>

117
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.861
<v Speaker 2>version to think about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you say we as citizens will never</v>

118
00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 2>have the expertise to truly vote on</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

119
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.570
<v Speaker 2>but we understand our own values and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>can say what kind of society do we want</v>

120
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create?</v>

121
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 2>And it will be the job of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians to take these values and</v>

122
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 2>translate them into specific instances</v>
<v Speaker 2>and rules.</v>
