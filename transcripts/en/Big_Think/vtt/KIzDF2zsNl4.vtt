1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inward,</v>

2
00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:04.830
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is that my could not</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand the inward,</v>

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>had no use for it in the context of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

4
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>did not matter to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her thing was very simply that if I have</v>

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>a vial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a with a cross bones and skulls on it</v>

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>and the word p o l I s o n written on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bottle.</v>

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's poisoned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I take that same poison and pour it</v>

8
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>into the most beautiful vase of baccarat</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystal ever made,</v>

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>it's still a poison for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The context of the use of the word and</v>

10
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>didn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this was a generational thing</v>

11
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>because my was 30 some years older than</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a or was at the time of us having</v>

12
00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 1>this conversation and my view of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inward has a bit more nuanced.</v>

13
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.403
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

14
00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.980
<v Speaker 1>based upon the generation that I've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in and the music that I listened</v>

15
00:00:49.981 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>to in the culture that I've been a part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

16
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>So my view is a little bit more liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>than my view on the inward.</v>

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>And so we had this debate for years</v>
<v Speaker 1>about whether or not,</v>

18
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inward was something that ought to</v>

19
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>be used in any context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we never agreed on that.</v>

20
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of things we never</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed on.</v>

21
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>She asked me when I was in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I thought the greatest virtue was</v>

22
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>of all the virtues tab is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the greatest virtue for you.</v>

23
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think love is the greatest of all the</v>

24
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 1>virtues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

25
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:20.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think courage.</v>

26
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.833
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

27
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.793
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

28
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>So for 28 years of our friendship we</v>
<v Speaker 1>debated,</v>

29
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>which is the greatest virtue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love or courage.</v>

30
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Her argument was that it takes courage</v>
<v Speaker 1>to love it.</v>

31
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>My argument was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

32
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.311
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

33
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but love is courage enacted a,</v>

34
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:41.530
<v Speaker 1>I believe that love is the greatest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the virtue.</v>

35
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 1>She thought it was courage and we never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never settled that debate.</v>

36
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.550
<v Speaker 1>So there are a number of things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>would come back to time and time again</v>

37
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>over the course of our relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we had different opinions.</v>

38
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>The point of this is that she allowed me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to interrogate her.</v>

39
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>She allowed me to disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She welcomed my opinion.</v>

40
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>She wanted to hear what I thought on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular issue,</v>

41
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.920
<v Speaker 1>even if she thought I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had debates about the merits of art</v>

42
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>versus entertainment and what makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>something art,</v>

43
00:02:08.011 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>what makes something entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had these debates all the time,</v>

44
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:13.350
<v Speaker 1>but it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was such a beautiful relationship</v>

45
00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>where we were always allowed to engage</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and no matter what the</v>

46
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>conversation was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how tense or terse it might've</v>

47
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>been about a particular subject matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every conversation always,</v>

48
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.990
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always ended on a love note.</v>

49
00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>She never allowed the conversation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>end without it being on a low note.</v>
