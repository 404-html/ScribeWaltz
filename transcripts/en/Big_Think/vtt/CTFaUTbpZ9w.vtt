1
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Preserving economic interests requires</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading and working with governments,</v>

2
00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

3
00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that violate human rights.</v>

4
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>And there are some who would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>you can't do both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>

6
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go and talk to the Chinese about</v>

7
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.040
<v Speaker 1>stabilizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>the global economy and the steps that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to take to,</v>

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to help us deal with,</v>

10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously a,</v>

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 1>an existential economic crisis and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time lecture them about their</v>

12
00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>treatment of dissidence for prisoners or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Falun Gong or Tibetans or what have</v>

13
00:00:53.231 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's right.</v>

14
00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 1>I think that the United States and</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like trying to work together</v>

15
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.650
<v Speaker 1>on economic matters because it's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mutual interest to do so.</v>

16
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think China or any other country</v>
<v Speaker 1>works with us on those issues,</v>

17
00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do us a favor.</v>

18
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.760
<v Speaker 1>They do it because it's in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to do so as well.</v>

19
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think we damage ourselves</v>

20
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:25.981
<v Speaker 1>diplomatically if we stand up for our</v>
<v Speaker 1>principals so long as we do it in a</v>

21
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>intelligent way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's the challenge of diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

23
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it's doing more than one thing at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

24
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And any secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>or any president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>who is up to the enormous challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.340
<v Speaker 1>of those jobs should be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

28
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that it's unrealistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think that,</v>

29
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can simply drop those issues.</v>

30
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go into a meeting with the</v>

31
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Chinese and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

32
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

33
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 1>we just can't afford to raise the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that dissident.</v>

34
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>We can't afford to lecture them about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the port Tibetans because we've got to</v>

35
00:02:10.931 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>save the global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then three months later,</v>

36
00:02:14.261 --> 00:02:15.970
<v Speaker 1>something awful is going to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tibet.</v>

37
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And guess what?</v>

38
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>The United States government is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to say something about it because</v>

39
00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>it would be politically impossible not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

40
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And then the Chinese having seen the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern of silence become even more</v>

41
00:02:31.391 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 1>upset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>

42
00:02:33.161 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 1>where does that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We thought you weren't talking to us</v>

43
00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>about that stuff anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the diplomatic costs are even</v>

44
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:42.200
<v Speaker 1>greater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think for,</v>

45
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic diplomatic reasons,</v>

46
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:49.891
<v Speaker 1>it's better just to be principled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent and send the message out to</v>

47
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>every country that we work with around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

48
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just part of doing business with</v>

49
00:02:54.161 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>the United States that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>raise those issues.</v>

50
00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's who we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what we believe.</v>

51
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno about self determination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sovereignty,</v>

52
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.970
<v Speaker 1>a state sovereignty is often used as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>argument against intervening to stop</v>

53
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 1>human rights abuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 1>and it's a complicated set of arguments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.520
<v Speaker 1>but certainly in cases where you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme violence against civilians,</v>

56
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat or reality of mass killing</v>

57
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>and genocide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in,</v>

58
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:37.081
<v Speaker 1>in fact the United Nations has adopted a</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of responsibility to protect,</v>

59
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.140
<v Speaker 1>to deal with those situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if,</v>

60
00:03:40.141 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>if a state is failing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to protect its own people</v>

61
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>from those kinds of abuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the rest of the world has a</v>

62
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:52.920
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to step in in whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>way may be effective.</v>

63
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we're talking about,</v>

64
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less extreme violations of human rights</v>

65
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>torture or a newspapers being closed</v>
<v Speaker 1>down or people being in prison because</v>

66
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>because they're expressing their views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think very few people argue that those</v>

69
00:04:11.201 --> 00:04:14.460
<v Speaker 1>cases merit military intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 1>invading a country to take down it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

71
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>But there are other tools that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>are appropriate to use to pressure</v>

72
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>countries to change their behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's the right thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

74
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>partly because there are legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations being violated when</v>

75
00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>governments violate human rights in</v>
<v Speaker 1>those ways.</v>

76
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>And partly because we have a self</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest in,</v>

77
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Americans,</v>

78
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.191
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

79
00:04:43.191 --> 00:04:48.191
<v Speaker 1>in building a world in which governments</v>
<v Speaker 1>treat their people better than a lot of</v>

80
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>reasons for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

81
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't think that sovereignty is an</v>

82
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>absolute bar to one country or one group</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

83
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting human rights beyond their</v>

84
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.550
<v Speaker 1>political borders.</v>

85
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>The United States can't be an effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>champion of human rights anywhere,</v>

86
00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.500
<v Speaker 1>if it's a generally seen around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a violator of human rights.</v>

87
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.470
<v Speaker 1>And so when the Bush administration was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just engaging that justifying</v>

88
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:28.650
<v Speaker 1>practices like torture and disappearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in secret prisons and long term</v>

89
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.870
<v Speaker 1>detention without charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

90
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very difficult,</v>

91
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 1>not impossible interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but difficult for the United States to</v>

92
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:40.690
<v Speaker 1>effectively urge other countries not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do those things.</v>

93
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>I do think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'm critical of some of the</v>

94
00:05:43.331 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>things that the Obama administration has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

95
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has gone a long way towards,</v>

96
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just eliminating those practices but</v>

97
00:05:51.971 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>convincing the world that they are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminated.</v>

98
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I think this is actually a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a rare moment when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

100
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the United States government and</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the president has a lot of</v>

101
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:07.330
<v Speaker 1>moral credibility to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

102
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>go to the world and champion and end to</v>
<v Speaker 1>torture and,</v>

103
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair trials for everybody and freedom of</v>

104
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 1>the press and freedom of speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

105
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>that moment may not last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do have a moment like that now</v>

106
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's important that it be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>effectively and wisely.</v>

107
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.460
<v Speaker 1>Technology can be used to suppress human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and to facilitate human rights.</v>

108
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.500
<v Speaker 1>That's always been the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

109
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.340
<v Speaker 1>there's never been one technology that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>is beneficial only to one side and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle.</v>

111
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.740
<v Speaker 1>So governments like China and Iran can</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the Internet to monitor,</v>

112
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

113
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:51.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their people's communication,</v>

114
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try to identify dissidence,</v>

115
00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and go after them individually.</v>

116
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.360
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

117
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 1>campaigners for democracy and human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights can also use these technologies</v>

118
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 1>as we saw in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

119

<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>

120
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.430

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot that the United States</v>

123
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 1>can do to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

124
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>to help the,</v>

125
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

126
00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:30.611
<v Speaker 1>there are really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies being developed that allow</v>

127
00:07:31.251 --> 00:07:35.920
<v Speaker 1>people to communicate privately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>to defeat surveillance and to defeat</v>
<v Speaker 1>censorship,</v>

129
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs that can be downloaded,</v>

130
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by folks in Iran and China and Burma and</v>

00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:46.994
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam.</v>

132
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that we've asked the</v>

133
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>US government to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

135
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very interesting and ambiguous role</v>

136
00:07:58.371 --> 00:08:03.371
<v Speaker 1>played by a American technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies like Google and Yahoo and</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>these are the companies that develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>these liberating technologies that,</v>

139
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissidents in Iran and China use,</v>

140
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 1>but they've also sometimes partnered</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the governments,</v>

141
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give them,</v>

142
00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology they use to suppress</v>

<v Speaker 1>dissent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>

145
00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:30.190
<v Speaker 1>And so helping these companies figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out what their responsibilities are when</v>

146
00:08:31.101 --> 00:08:36.101
<v Speaker 1>they are operating in dictatorships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>backing them up when they have to stand</v>

147
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>up to those governments is a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important challenge for the 20th.</v>

148
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.350
