00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Billing errors almost invariably are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>our disadvantage.</v>

2
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.050
<v Speaker 1>It's so stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One feels so blessed.</v>

3
00:00:08.051 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>One feels so Leprechaun pod of Goldie</v>
<v Speaker 1>defines a billing error in our favor</v>

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.640
<v Speaker 1>that the temptation to take advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

5
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty potent but don't yield to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

6
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Here's the essential point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not right to profit from someone</v>

7
00:00:22.451 --> 00:00:24.940
<v Speaker 1>else's innocent error and in your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

8
00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>If you drop your wallet on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you expect people to return it with the</v>

9
00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>cash in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's innocent error is not meant to</v>

10
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>be a profit making opportunity that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a kind of civic duty to play our</v>

11
00:00:37.931 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to return the lost property,</v>

12
00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>to point out when the door to the bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been left ajar,</v>

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.550
<v Speaker 1>not to simply exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't want to live in that kind of</v>

14
00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,</v>

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you can't exploit an innocent air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Time Warner's,</v>

16
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 1>even though you may have harsh feelings</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a person or an entity,</v>

17
00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 1>you don't sacrifice your moral values</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're dealing with him that his</v>

18
00:01:01.691 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 1>good conduct doesn't just flow to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

19
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>You regard as good people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a set of ethical principles</v>

20
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>that you apply to all people in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

21
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means Time Warner has made an</v>

22
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>innocent error by leaving you with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>de Luxe cable package,</v>

23
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>even though you're paying for what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe they,</v>

24
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the cheapskate package,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how it's designated on my</v>

25
00:01:21.521 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to let them know now that the</v>

26
00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:25.870
<v Speaker 1>second question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>how hard do you have to try to let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and you certainly don't have to</v>

28
00:01:30.071 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>make it your life's work to inform</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone when they've made this kind of</v>

29
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one phone call.</v>

30
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

31
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Two phone calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>I'd say so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That meets my standard.</v>

33
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would send them a letter as much to</v>

34
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:44.740
<v Speaker 1>protect yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should you get receive a bill two years</v>

35
00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>from now for 24 months of the Lux cable</v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

36
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.650
<v Speaker 1>But once you've made a good faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable efforts,</v>

37
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 1>and I realized these are ambiguous terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>to inform them about their air,</v>

38
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>then they're on their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do not have to make it your life's</v>

39
00:01:57.401 --> 00:02:02.401
<v Speaker 1>work to correct time warner sloppiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other aspect of this is these</v>

40
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:04.900
<v Speaker 1>exchanges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these moral exchanges have to be</v>

41
00:02:04.901 --> 00:02:07.780
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That if you would want someone to tell</v>

42
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you that they have overcharged you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to tell them that they've</v>

43
00:02:11.861 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>undercharged you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethics must have parody.</v>

44
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.700
<v Speaker 1>Ethics must have symmetry for an ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposition to be compelling.</v>

45
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It must seem fair no matter which seat</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in.</v>
