00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 2>such a hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would I go to dinner with?</v>

3
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to pick a feminist because</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could probably like figuring out</v>

4
00:00:19.761 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 2>a way to get like dinner with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>feminist.</v>

5
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.853
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.893
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

7
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 2>this is going to sound kind of twisted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think Raymond Carver,</v>

8
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 2>the writer who I love and is kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

9
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an alcoholic and not like</v>

10
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 2>necessarily a very good person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just have always really loved his</v>

11
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 2>short stories and I would just love to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pick his brain.</v>
