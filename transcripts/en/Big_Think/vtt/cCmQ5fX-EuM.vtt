1
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Hardly anyone has raised more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious,</v>

2
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>imaginative children than the legendary</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid century children's book editor,</v>

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>Ursula Nordstrom who brought to life</v>
<v Speaker 1>such multigenerational classics as</v>

4
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Wise Brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goodnight Moon Ed White's Charlotte's</v>

5
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>web,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shel Silverstein's,</v>

6
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>the giving tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Maurice Sendak's where the wild</v>

7
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:28.680
<v Speaker 1>things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During her long tenure at Harper and</v>

8
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>row,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nordstrom was not just an editor to her</v>

9
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>authors at her artists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their friend.</v>

10
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They're confident,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their therapists,</v>

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>their greatest champion always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She stood up against censorship and</v>

12
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>constantly bolstered the creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence of these young writers and</v>

13
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a special instrumental and the</v>

14
00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>life of Maurice Sendak who might not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we know him as today without her,</v>

15
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

16
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>was a beautiful letter writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her letters are collected in a book</v>

17
00:00:57.421 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>called dear genius by the Children's</v>
<v Speaker 1>book historian Leonard Marcus.</v>

18
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>And so in one exchange with Sendak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote to her despairing over having</v>

19
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:10.470
<v Speaker 1>been commissioned to illustrate the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tolstoy and feeling utterly</v>

20
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>inadequate to match tolstoy's genius.</v>

21
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>And so she wrote to him and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may not be tolstoy.</v>

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Tolstoy wasn't sendak either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have a vast and beautiful genius.</v>

23
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 1>This emboldens Sendak enormously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the following year,</v>

24
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.070
<v Speaker 1>he was already working on his very own</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the wild things are,</v>

25
00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>which went on to become one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>beloved children's books of all time.</v>

26
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>But most of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nordstrom defended the world and the</v>

27
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:42.201
<v Speaker 1>experience of the child against all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial pressures for commodities and</v>

28
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:47.241
<v Speaker 1>conformity and politely boring</v>
<v Speaker 1>storytelling that dominated children's</v>

29
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>books at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the most benevolent patron saint</v>

30
00:01:52.141 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>of modern childhood ended up being a gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman working at the height of</v>

31
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.671
<v Speaker 1>consumerism and somehow managing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>publish an envision and defend books</v>

32
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>that were not forgettable commodities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but extraordinary masterworks.</v>

33
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>That's stood the test of time and moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inspired and enchanted generations.</v>
