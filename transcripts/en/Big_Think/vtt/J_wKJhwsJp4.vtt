1
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.950
<v Speaker 1>No one knows all the answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll.</v>

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>I'll mention two of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me say two words.</v>

3
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>Television News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>television news.</v>

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Fifty years ago when television news was</v>
<v Speaker 1>young,</v>

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>the philosophy television news is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically just broadcast news on</v>

6
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was reporters on television,</v>

7
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>somebody trying to say what had</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

8
00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.930
<v Speaker 1>That was what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have 30 minutes of news</v>

9
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>without a single televised clip of</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

10
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Just somebody that's sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading the news sometimes at great</v>

11
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was television news.</v>

12
00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>It was simply an effort to inform</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays never to entertain and to play</v>

13
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 1>to the gallery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It matters if there are pictures of</v>

14
00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If their jokes you can tell matters,</v>

15
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>we'd get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People want to yell and scream at each</v>

16
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:48.644
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 1>That's really taken us down a sad path</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone says,</v>

18
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's emphasized the notion that the</v>

19
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>right way to have interaction is to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strong advocates who will call each</v>

20
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>other names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that's striking about the way</v>

21
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>the news is today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take an issue,</v>

22
00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>a contested issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion,</v>

23
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you like news today is virgo to</v>

24
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>telling us people's positions on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

25
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>Candidates say it's very bad at telling</v>
<v Speaker 1>us why they have their positions.</v>

26
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it strikes me that one of the jobs of</v>

27
00:01:17.531 --> 00:01:20.480
<v Speaker 1>were news reporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to say so and so is for or against</v>

28
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>abortion rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what so and so's argument,</v>

29
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>why does so and so I believe that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago I ran into a guy who was</v>

30
00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:32.831
<v Speaker 1>retired reporter for a major newspaper</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was lamenting what had happened</v>

31
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>to the news and he was telling me how</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was coming along in the sixties,</v>

32
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>if the president announced the New Urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>Affairs Initiative,</v>

33
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the headline would be the next day</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Announces Urban Affairs</v>

34
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Initiative.</v>

35
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>And the story would be explaining what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

36
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>This is what the president proposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the story today.</v>

37
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we had this meeting in the nineties</v>

38
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said the story would be Republicans</v>

39
00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>Attack Presidents Urban Affairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initiative as the first paragraph is a</v>

40
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>brief token.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Summer was having the secretary or</v>

41
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody attacking it third grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>because somebody at defending it,</v>

42
00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>you never take much time to explain what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

43
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is who's gonna win?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's gonna lose,</v>

44
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>who's on which side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

45
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Certainly that's to help take us down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the only thing.</v>

46
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:18.260
<v Speaker 1>One theory is the big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxury.</v>

47
00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>We've been a generation here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I speak of myself and the other baby</v>

48
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>boomers whose had everything we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel as though we've ever.</v>

49
00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 1>They were constantly complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's going wrong in our lives,</v>

50
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.890
<v Speaker 1>but there's a sense which compared to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of world we've had everything</v>

51
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>we've everything we could want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>and that's given us a lot of time to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruminate,</v>

53
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 1>a maybe too much time to read what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think our luxury has made us in cautious</v>

54
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.530
<v Speaker 1>in how we use democracy.</v>
