1
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it may have something to do with</v>

2
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>the</v>
<v Speaker 1>myths of the gala to at least the ideal</v>

3
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>of Galitary aneurysm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>it's better to be a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with sort of good standing in the</v>

6
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good character and so on than to be a,</v>

7
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.000
<v Speaker 1>an egghead eggheads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>a suspected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not just American culture.</v>

9
00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was true traditionally in,</v>

10
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.000
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Britain as well.</v>

11
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's something to be said for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.730
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there many unpleasant,</v>

13
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of,</v>

14
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>of that kind of fillets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Philistinism.</v>

15
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>But the good thing is that ideas can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous.</v>

16
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Intellectuals are dangerous where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give them too much power because they</v>

17
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 1>tend to take ideas to their extreme and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.780
<v Speaker 1>they're not practical people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's good,</v>

20
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I think to be a little suspicious of</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking idea,</v>

21
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>any idea to its extreme and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably better to have people in power</v>

22
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>who are more practical and who can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who know the art of compromise.</v>

23
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he would be,</v>

24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.220
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a shocked because some of his,</v>

25
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly some of his is worse,</v>

26
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.730
<v Speaker 1>his most pessimistic predictions would</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to have come true and that he,</v>

27
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

28
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>he was on the one hand in favor of</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and he admired American</v>

29
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was frightened of the possible</v>

30
00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it could lead to tremendous</v>

31
00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:48.110
<v Speaker 1>vulgarity and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think he probably would see that</v>

32
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>and you would also see a much less a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conformist population probably than the</v>

33
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>one he saw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on where he would travel,</v>

34
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 1>and I think he probably would be rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>shocked by the tone of the public</v>

36
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:13.421
<v Speaker 1>figures of the politicians who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably less little less high minded</v>

37
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>than the ones that he encountered when</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was there.</v>
