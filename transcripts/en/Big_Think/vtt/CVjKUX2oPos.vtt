1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:00.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was there that I</v>

3
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 2>decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>that even if I wasn't going to die,</v>

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 2>and obviously I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not afraid of death.</v>

5
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 2>The is part of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people I have met a particularly.</v>

6
00:00:32.951 --> 00:00:37.951
<v Speaker 2>Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>just are so afraid of death.</v>

7
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't look forward to it at 85.</v>

8
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 2>I know it's just a few years away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't fear it.</v>

9
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 2>I believe in the afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe,</v>

10
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 2>and a reward and punishment and I hope</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be rewarded.</v>

11
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I think some of all of that comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>having served in</v>

12
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

13
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 2>and I think I'm serving in a war and</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing people die,</v>

14
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also impacts on how you think about</v>

15
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 2>other wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I believe,</v>

16
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this country has to be defended and</v>

17
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 2>air are just wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And certainly World War Two was a such a</v>

18
00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 2>just war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.010
<v Speaker 2>but that the Vietnam War was not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that we shouldn't be in</v>

20
00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was marching the various</v>

21
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 2>demonstrations against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 2>believed it was wrong and ultimately I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge majority of the people of this</v>

24
00:01:56.021 --> 00:01:57.490
<v Speaker 2>country thought it was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

25
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they stopped it with their marches.</v>

26
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think like most soldiers at the time,</v>

27
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 2>I served in the European theater of</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations and served into campaigns,</v>

28
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>one for northern France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other for the Rhineland and I fought</v>

29
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 2>in Holland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Belgium,</v>

30
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 2>I saw people killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very frightened and often thought</v>

32
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 2>I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably die,</v>

33
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe on the battlefield somewhere,</v>

34
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

35
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 2>I came out alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was discharged as a sergeant.</v>

36
00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

37
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 2>I think that being in a war and has an</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on your character</v>

38
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.610
<v Speaker 2>outlook on life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

39
00:03:01.611 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't recommend it,</v>

40
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 2>certainly other ways to build character.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

41
00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's part of who you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are.</v>
