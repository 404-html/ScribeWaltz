1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I moved back to my neighborhood in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>late nineties,</v>

2
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>after spending many years to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>disassociate myself from it because it</v>

3
00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>was to me just the epicenter of urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>blight and you know,</v>

4
00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>it was dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does smell funny.</v>

5
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of problems associated</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

6
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>And I'd also buy all my formative years</v>
<v Speaker 1>were kind of watching the disinvestment</v>

7
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>of the community for both the financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector as well,</v>

8
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as business sector as well.</v>

9
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.390
<v Speaker 1>And it was a difficult place to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I got to school,</v>

10
00:00:35.391 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 1>I got a chance to go away to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left and I swore never to come back.</v>

11
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 1>And it was only because I was so broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had to move back home with my</v>

12
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 1>parents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

13
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.790
<v Speaker 1>but once I got there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what got me there was the fact</v>

14
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 1>that like there was this burgeoning art</v>
<v Speaker 1>community there.</v>

15
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>So that was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

16
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>I was an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I want it to be a part of that.</v>

17
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>But what kept me there was honestly</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting politicized,</v>

18
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about recognizing that my poor community</v>

19
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>was actually being targeted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>targeted as a place that for the</v>

20
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>repository,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>for all of the bad things that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthier and usually wider communities</v>

22
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:09.310
<v Speaker 1>could avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>I came back home to find out that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayor Giuliani and Pataki,</v>

24
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>our governor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're planning on building this huge</v>

25
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>waste facility on our waterfront.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>that would've brought about 40% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city's municipal waste to the area.</v>

27
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Even though we were already handling</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 40% of the city's commercial</v>

28
00:01:25.341 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an enormous amount of waste was</v>

29
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.160
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

30
00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>put upon our backs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they were public health issues</v>

31
00:01:31.011 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>associated with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just thought,</v>

32
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:34.790
<v Speaker 1>why is this happening?</v>

33
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized it was because it was a poor</v>

34
00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 1>community and a poor community of color</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

35
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>and the whole idea of environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>justice is it just just simply means</v>

36
00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>that no community should have to bear</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brunt of lots of environmental</v>

37
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>burdens and not enjoy environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>

38
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>And right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>race and class are great indicators as</v>

39
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>to where you're gonna find good stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like parks and trees and really bad</v>

40
00:01:56.061 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>stuff like waste facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just really struck me as like,</v>

41
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I want it to be a part of the solution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not just,</v>

42
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretended it didn't exist or just,</v>

43
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.320
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
