3
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>It's a foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started a few years ago and we started</v>

4
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:24.771
<v Speaker 1>it because we wanted to bring self</v>
<v Speaker 1>esteem back to Haiti and currently 7,000</v>

5
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>kids have scholarships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We started something which is called hip</v>

6
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:35.160
<v Speaker 1>hop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip hop for health mobile clinics going</v>

7
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>throughout Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm giving people HIV tests,</v>

8
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>giving them condoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but through music there's also a</v>

9
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>children's prison program where we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>went into these prisons,</v>

10
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>whether it's kids introduce chest took</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the prisons,</v>

11
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>but more beds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basketball courts and these kids were</v>

12
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

13
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.510
<v Speaker 1>every time I go down there and tears</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to my eyes because I knew I wasn't</v>

14
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these kids was in gangs.</v>

15
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most terrible violence you could think</v>

16
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:12.741
<v Speaker 1>about a yearly is actually the movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really working and it's,</v>

17
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the greatest thing is when I look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a kid and I noticed that</v>

18
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>I can rise his self esteem because</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone rose myself esteem.</v>

19
00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm here as yelling.</v>

20
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing is</v>

21
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>we have a documentary coming out which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is called CRI.</v>

22
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 1>Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is my work on the ground for</v>

23
00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the past three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

24
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.660
<v Speaker 1>I didn't leave the ground until I felt</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the people on the ground understood</v>

25
00:01:43.661 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>what we was doing and was training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I kept going back and forth,</v>

26
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:49.900
<v Speaker 1>back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I feel like we have great a</v>

27
00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.600
<v Speaker 1>great team on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a great ngos,</v>

28
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>but to get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took three years of me going back and</v>

29
00:01:55.721 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>forth to Haiti.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of times when you starting</v>

30
00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>foundations for it to really work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be hands on for the first</v>

31
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm in in right now.</v>

32
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
