1
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a philosopher,</v>

2
00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:16.001
<v Speaker 1>so I was thinking of soldiers in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of there's the meaning and philosophical</v>

3
00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>meaning of their stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emotions and the deep emotions.</v>

4
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And I interviewed a lot of soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about 30 to 40 soldiers,</v>

5
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:30.171
<v Speaker 1>so the current wars and including some</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Bosnia and Vietnam and my dad who's</v>

6
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:35.981
<v Speaker 1>a World War II veteran and I really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to go beyond just stories about</v>

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>trauma of which many soldiers don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffer though,</v>

8
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>of course we know many do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wanted to talk about the feelings</v>

9
00:00:44.121 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>everyone seems to come home with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying to make moral sense of what</v>

10
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:49.990
<v Speaker 1>they've seen and done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.180
<v Speaker 1>even when they do everything right by</v>
<v Speaker 1>wars,</v>

12
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.290
<v Speaker 1>best standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was talking about the,</v>

13
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>the moral weight of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>memorial burdens of war.</v>

14
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad actually just died,</v>

15
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>December 15th that the days I was</v>

16
00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:11.411
<v Speaker 1>putting the final touches on the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I always knew he was a world war two</v>

17
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>veteran and a medic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He never fired a rifle a gun during the</v>

18
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always had this sense that war was</v>

19
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:21.410
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't want to talk about it like</v>

20
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>many of his generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a member of a laconic generation.</v>

21
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he died I was cleaning up as</v>

22
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>affects and found in his pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his dog tags and um,</v>

23
00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>he never told me and I never asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was 65 years of carrying his</v>

24
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 1>dog tags.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 1>they were an identity to be sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're also a moral identity or</v>

26
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>moral burden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought he really carried it</v>

27
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>silently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought it wasn't polite conversation</v>

28
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>to talk about the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I probed,</v>

29
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:54.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would say,</v>

30
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>well aboard the Qe one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Queen Elizabeth,</v>

31
00:01:57.771 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>the first and the Queen Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a slaughter house.</v>

32
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>It was a butcher shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was amputated legs and men that were</v>

33
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.590
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really suffering,</v>

34
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one will have a leg in that one,</v>

35
00:02:08.691 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Walt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was painful.</v>

36
00:02:10.671 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Tears would come down and I realized he</v>
<v Speaker 1>never wanted to watch footage of the war</v>

37
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>and he wasn't traumatized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think is very healthy,</v>

38
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>resilient guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if his war was difficult,</v>

39
00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>it was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many.</v>

40
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think war should be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>private burden,</v>

41
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a draft war or a volunteer</v>

42
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:33.110
<v Speaker 1>force or your guard national guard or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

43
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>a member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>contractors are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no history is complicated story,</v>

45
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:38.840
<v Speaker 1>but go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going out.</v>

46
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm going out to war part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves.</v>

47
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>So he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

48
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

49
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unconscious reason you might say.</v>

50
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>I also have an uncle who fought in world</v>
<v Speaker 1>war two as a marine</v>

51
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>bayonet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oka Allah,</v>

52
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 1>really ugly.</v>

53
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>And he did suffer ptsd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>posttraumatic stress disorder.</v>

54
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>But the book isn't really about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about psychological injuries that we</v>

55
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>know about that are very acute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the everyday ordinary mix of</v>

56
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:15.890
<v Speaker 1>feeling exultant about the battle and</v>
<v Speaker 1>exuberant and that it's your,</v>

57
00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>the time of your life to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to shine for some and that that's the</v>

58
00:03:20.561 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>only way that you could go in and be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniper who's defending himself and his</v>

59
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:26.090
<v Speaker 1>buddies and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for victory or survival.</v>

61
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.060
<v Speaker 1>And then also feeling the shame of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing what you do when you do it.</v>

62
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
