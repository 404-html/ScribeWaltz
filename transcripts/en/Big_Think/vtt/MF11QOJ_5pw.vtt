1
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>And here's a writer I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have actually,</v>

2
00:00:07.431 --> 00:00:11.710
<v Speaker 1>this is a man of war and I borrowed my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my best friend,</v>

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Amy Beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a beautiful a nature writer.</v>

4
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>She wrote this line about men of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man of war appears to be one</v>

5
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 1>individual like Leo Tolstoy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually many individuals</v>

6
00:00:24.971 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 1>living together as a colony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Leo Tolstoy said,</v>

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

8
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>he starts in my head more big wise than</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody else in the world.</v>

9
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>So for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolstoy ended his journal each day with</v>

10
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:47.071
<v Speaker 1>three letters and they show for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian if I live every month.</v>

11
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>He began with the note nearer to death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a few weeks ago I actually went to</v>

12
00:00:55.151 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Russia and I visited a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naya,</v>

13
00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>pollyanna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He stayed outside Moscow and there I</v>

14
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 1>learned that he had failed many things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

15
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 1>He failed assets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools as an educator,</v>

16
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>he failed at breeding horses.</v>

17
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>He failed at farming and of course he</v>
<v Speaker 1>also failed eventual in his religious</v>

18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>endeavor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much the only thing he didn't</v>

19
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:25.381
<v Speaker 1>fail it was to be a writer and asset</v>
<v Speaker 1>babble in the Russian writer.</v>

20
00:01:25.691 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite writers said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the world could,</v>

21
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.540
<v Speaker 1>if the world could write by itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would write like tolstoy</v>

22
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>and I take that to mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>we know there are big ways and small</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways in life.</v>

24
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the world wrote itself like it is</v>

25
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Super Spolan or Porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be all big wise but was tolstoy</v>

26
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The balance of big ways and small lies.</v>

27
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>The big wires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For many,</v>

28
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm a psychiatric ward and to sell too</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people outside in the world can be</v>

29
00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:07.480
<v Speaker 1>summarized as such.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why live?</v>

30
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Why suffer and why suffer on now any one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us had I answered there and I think</v>

31
00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>particularly for those who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>experienced mental illness,</v>

32
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>there's also another question we cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

33
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Why are you you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you you?</v>

34
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And there are many variations of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

35
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Why are you not happy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you stay hopeful?</v>

36
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you see the bright side of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

37
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so selfish?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you just be like everyone</v>

38
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.630
<v Speaker 1>else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you be real?</v>

39
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you be rational?</v>

40
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>The big lies a timeless questions any</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking them.</v>

41
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 1>And then not being able to find answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One puts oneself in the timeless trap.</v>

42
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>Anyone suffering severe depression may</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the experience,</v>

43
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>the time coming to stop one day to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

44
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.750
<v Speaker 1>one minute to the next time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the most precious possession we</v>

45
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:24.241
<v Speaker 1>have becomes the most treacherous thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's time real.</v>

46
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 1>It's time rational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a way for us to experience time</v>

47
00:03:31.551 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>in the real world and rational manner?</v>

48
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Time in the world of physics is probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most democratic experience.</v>

50
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say tom's minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as my minute a dictator stays.</v>

51
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.550
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one seconds longer than my day,</v>

52
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>but time experienced by each individual</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we all know is so much less</v>

53
00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:59.310
<v Speaker 1>scientific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much less reliable</v>

54
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.270
<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a big license small wise,</v>

55
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look around at our lives and come up</v>

56
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.400
<v Speaker 1>with abundance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small why's,</v>

57
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.880
<v Speaker 1>why do I agree to eat at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant?</v>

58
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.200
<v Speaker 1>But now they want to cross the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was what I really wanted to go.</v>

59
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Why do I read the news first thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the morning when I know I shouldn't?</v>

60
00:04:21.931 --> 00:04:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Because that makes me burn my children's</v>
<v Speaker 1>toast.</v>

61
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Why do I want to train for a marathon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and here is one of my favorite wise,</v>

62
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 1>not asked by me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by an older man.</v>

63
00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>When he was the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he listened to my public radio and he</v>

64
00:04:37.951 --> 00:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I tell myself this morning?</v>

65
00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 1>Now that piece of cake I ate was good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

66
00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.570
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't,</v>

67
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.690
<v Speaker 1>but we don't live to answer all these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small wise,</v>

68
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.320
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't and exhausted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted parent of small child can</v>

69
00:04:57.391 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>relate to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have to wear shoes?</v>

70
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Why do I have to brush my teeth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't I sleep in the dog bed?</v>

71
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Where's the puppy?</v>

72
00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.023
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

73
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.200
<v Speaker 1>and then there are the big wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big why's are not always answerable.</v>

74
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may say that they're big lies because</v>

75
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:24.221
<v Speaker 1>they can be answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the danger of living is that</v>

76
00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:29.411
<v Speaker 1>inevitably we run into people who think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that why has an answer and they think</v>

77
00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:35.731
<v Speaker 1>man has to answer for them and when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can provide a satisfactory answer,</v>

78
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>they will do that for us often with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasty and judge.</v>

79
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>A Manto answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big whys are life and death or on a</v>

80
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:50.710
<v Speaker 1>piece that small wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we can find answers,</v>

81
00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.761
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

82
00:05:51.761 --> 00:05:55.420
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have to find answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just to acknowledge them,</v>

83
00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.510
<v Speaker 1>insulate and sustain us.</v>
