00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:09.231
<v Speaker 1>no women had no rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Taliban came to Afghanistan.</v>

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>What you don't know is Afghan women had</v>
<v Speaker 1>their rights before European women even</v>

4
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was in American woman even knew</v>

5
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>a very sophisticated country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>in that sense that women were working</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulder to shoulder with men and women,</v>

8
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>their work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightclubs,</v>

9
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

10
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>there's picture I've seen a my mom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>her friends wearing high boots,</v>

11
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>mini skirts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dancing,</v>

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to work with the beautiful suits,</v>

13
00:00:48.361 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above the knee skirt,</v>

14
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>high heels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country went like 500 years</v>

15
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that was really</v>

16
00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>extremely upsetting for African women</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you never seen independence</v>

17
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>and freedom and you'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hit you so hard if somebody</v>

18
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:12.300
<v Speaker 1>surprises you a little bit further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you had complete freedom and it's</v>

19
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>come in and it's all taken from you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a shock that it's extremely</v>

20
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.500
<v Speaker 1>difficult to absorb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

21
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was beyond that for me when I</v>

22
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>looked at my country at that time,</v>

23
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 2>we should</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask about how Judas,</v>

24
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.890
<v Speaker 2>but children want</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can make an Amazon mean jail</v>

30
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

36
00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.140
<v Speaker 1>And this suburbs is still very</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>

37
00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:27.141
<v Speaker 1>but in Cabo it's changing a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you go to a shock like that,</v>

38
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:28.014
<v Speaker 1>a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media asked me a lot about,</v>

40
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 1>are you working on getting the burgers</v>
<v Speaker 1>off their women?</v>

42
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>my answer to that is the last thing that</v>

43
00:02:41.671 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>an Afghan woman is thinking about right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is the,</v>

44
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:47.010
<v Speaker 1>she have a burqa on or off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's worried about her life,</v>

45
00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 1>about her safety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her family's safety.</v>

46
00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>She's poverty is in the highest level</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

47
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.270
<v Speaker 1>She just cares about building a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making some rice and feeding her family.</v>

48
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the priority of having her Burka offer</v>

49
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>on is not on top of her agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>what we need to do for women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan is education,</v>

51
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

52
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>so they can stand up for themselves.</v>

53
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And when I'm in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
