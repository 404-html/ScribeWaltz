1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know much about the real problems</v>

2
00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:10.540
<v Speaker 1>in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say that,</v>

3
00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are problems of race that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hardly knew existed in San Francisco,</v>

4
00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but they were right in front of us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually got to see what they were.</v>

5
00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.190
<v Speaker 2>I can remember my mother telling me one</v>
<v Speaker 2>day she had a friend who was black and</v>

6
00:00:24.321 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to go to a restaurant for</v>
<v Speaker 2>lunch and they were going to go to the</v>

7
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.890
<v Speaker 2>St Francis Hotel and they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>discussing whether they could.</v>

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 2>And that was San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't the south.</v>

9
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 2>There is not a magic answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

11
00:00:40.071 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm probably since I recently wrote it</v>

12
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 2>to sand in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

13
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:44.861
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

14
00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:49.861
<v Speaker 2>in a case involving</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of race conscious criteria in</v>

15
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 2>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is whether the city of Seattle</v>

16
00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 2>could use a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as one criteria among several.</v>

18
00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 2>They allowed high school students</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom to choose whatever school they</v>

19
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:06.070
<v Speaker 2>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They listed preferences,</v>

20
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 2>but they said that no school will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 85 percent white.</v>

21
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Basically that was their criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the question was,</v>

22
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>could they actually overtly in that way</v>
<v Speaker 2>use a racial criteria and the court five</v>

23
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 2>to four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.870
<v Speaker 2>decided that they could not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could not.</v>

25
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 2>I descended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought,</v>

26
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:27.010
<v Speaker 2>of course I can at work consequences</v>
<v Speaker 2>relevant there.</v>

27
00:01:27.011 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 2>They certainly were to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

28
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 2>if you interpret the equal protection</v>
<v Speaker 2>clause to,</v>

29
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

30
00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for bid,</v>

31
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:39.391
<v Speaker 2>this is how are people supposed to deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>with problems of race and poverty in the</v>

32
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:44.881
<v Speaker 2>inner cities of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see the constitution as a very</v>

33
00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 2>workable document.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think Madison's genius was to say</v>

34
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get these values will</v>
<v Speaker 2>stay the same and we're going to embody</v>

35
00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:57.970
<v Speaker 2>them in words that allow their</v>
<v Speaker 2>application over the course of the next</v>

36
00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 2>four or 500 years and if not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not longer.</v>

37
00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 2>And to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to refer back to how do these</v>

38
00:02:05.351 --> 00:02:06.700
<v Speaker 2>values apply today?</v>

39
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 2>What's the value of the equal protection</v>
<v Speaker 2>clause?</v>

40
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Trying to bring us together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to create one nation,</v>

41
00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 2>trying to create races that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>separate indeed one held in slavery like</v>

42
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 2>a caste system and try to create one</v>
<v Speaker 2>country out of this diversity and it's a</v>

43
00:02:21.521 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 2>miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we've been able to do that to a</v>

44
00:02:23.441 --> 00:02:25.750
<v Speaker 2>degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still plenty of problems.</v>

45
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 2>And for me to think of that clause being</v>
<v Speaker 2>posed as an obstacle to such an effort.</v>

46
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I just think that that was wrong.</v>

47
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:36.430
<v Speaker 2>And I expressed my views very concisely</v>
<v Speaker 2>in about 77 pages.</v>

48
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm basically optimistic even with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I was most pessimistic about,</v>

49
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:45.270
<v Speaker 2>to go back to read a specific case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I W I was most pessimistic about the</v>

50
00:02:45.271 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 2>court's decision in the Seattle case</v>
<v Speaker 2>involving the use of race conscious</v>

51
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 2>criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about that seriously.</v>

52
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 2>I was in a descent.</v>

53
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.440
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a bad decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I wrote.</v>

54
00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

55
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impedes the ability of</v>

57
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 2>communities to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>take people who were isolated in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>center of the city,</v>

59
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 2>very poor family background could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible and,</v>

60
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lacking opportunity and try to work out</v>

61
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 2>the problems in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>

62
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 2>in the community context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think this is a bad decision.</v>

63
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>It's a throwback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's only a throwback to see because</v>

64
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately I am an optimist.</v>

65
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.610
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately I do think that people</v>
<v Speaker 2>overcome even this kind of a barrier and</v>

66
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 2>people figure out how to solve these</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

67
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 2>Not perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll do it.</v>

68
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:46.080
<v Speaker 2>The country itself is becoming much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a diverse country and yet we will</v>

69
00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 2>cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We cooperate,</v>

70
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>we know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really,</v>

71
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 2>I think are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are great.</v>

72
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 2>if there's an American contribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's in that respect,</v>

74
00:03:57.521 --> 00:04:02.521
<v Speaker 2>the respect of being open and coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a problem and not being prejudiced</v>

75
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:09.451
<v Speaker 2>about it and trying to look for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>solution arises out of the problem.</v>

76
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 2>It's a pragmatic attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an attitude that is not a respecter</v>

77
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 2>of persons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a respecter of problems and we</v>

78
00:04:18.401 --> 00:04:20.470
<v Speaker 2>don't just take what people say</v>

79
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.230
<v Speaker 3>for me.</v>
