1
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe me more than</v>

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 2>I picked it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I was conditioned that an early age to</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate nature photography through my</v>

4
00:00:16.691 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 2>grandfather who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was Irish and,</v>

5
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:23.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he left Ireland in the 1920s and moved</v>

6
00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:28.150
<v Speaker 2>to India and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a doctor and,</v>

7
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:30.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the early part of his life,</v>

8
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 2>he was engaged in safaris and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not that glorious,</v>

9
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:36.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking back in retrospect because he</v>

10
00:00:36.081 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 2>shot tigers and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in the twenties and thirties,</v>

11
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose it had a different type of a</v>

12
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.980
<v Speaker 2>social imprint as we might examine</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

13
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:47.650
<v Speaker 2>But in his midlife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he traded has a,</v>

14
00:00:47.651 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 2>is gone for a camera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I continued doing his safaris and</v>

15
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:54.850
<v Speaker 2>expeditions both in India and then later</v>
<v Speaker 2>on in,</v>

16
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.710
<v Speaker 2>in Africa and Botswana and Tanzania and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Namibia and,</v>

17
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:00.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and settled.</v>

18
00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:01.690
<v Speaker 2>He lived in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 2>in Swaziland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a north or South Africa.</v>

20
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 2>So his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 2>his body of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>photography work was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

23
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>impressed upon me at an early age</v>

24
00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 2>through a slideshows.</v>

25
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.730
<v Speaker 2>And I sat through many slideshows are</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching elephants and giraffes and</v>

26
00:01:18.731 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was my sort of early affinity</v>

27
00:01:21.851 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 2>to landscape photography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I started taking pictures in South</v>

29
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.890
<v Speaker 2>Africa myself when I was about 12,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

31
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Safaris and,</v>

32
00:01:32.241 --> 00:01:33.850
<v Speaker 2>and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

33
00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it just progressed.</v>

34
00:01:36.461 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 2>And I always somehow was picked to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 2>to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

36
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I translated that into a career in</v>

37
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 2>advertising where I did a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>directing,</v>

38
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 2>actually all of commercials and music</v>
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>

39
00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

40
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.070
<v Speaker 2>I decided to focus more specifically on</v>
<v Speaker 2>photography and get out of,</v>

41
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.100
<v Speaker 2>of advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't entirely comfortable,</v>

42
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.761
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

43
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.080
<v Speaker 2>as I developed as an advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 2>with promoting messages of consumerism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

45
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I settled on portrait photography for,</v>

46
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a career earning,</v>

47
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

49
00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course,</v>

50
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 2>I followed with my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.843
<v Speaker 2>my advocacy</v>

52
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>American landscape.</v>
