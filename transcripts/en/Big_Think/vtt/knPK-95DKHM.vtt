1
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>If I were a smart musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have done what the other smart</v>

2
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.810
<v Speaker 1>musicians did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only licensed your music in</v>

3
00:00:15.811 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>places where they don't speak English.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the credible musicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to name names,</v>

5
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but they don't license their music in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK or the states.</v>

6
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>They license it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Portugal are they licensed it and</v>

7
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>South Korea or Japan and that way the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tastemakers,</v>

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music journalists never hear about</v>

9
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.670
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a strange phenomenon because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>I have been criticized for licensing my</v>
<v Speaker 1>music to commercials,</v>

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>but it's odd for a few reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

13
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>that most of the journalists who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticized me write for publications</v>

14
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>that are wholly funded by ad revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>so there'll be an article criticizing me</v>
<v Speaker 1>for liking my music to commercials and</v>

16
00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>on the next page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an ad for Ford or budweiser or what</v>

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>have you.</v>

18
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>And the same journalists who are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who criticize me for licensing my music.</v>

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>by the products that are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertised.</v>

21
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

22
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the old punk rocker in me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always thought it was cooler to take</v>

23
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>money from a big corporation and to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>money to a big corporation.</v>

24
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>So I have regrets that I did too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>licensing.</v>

25
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I should have as I had been smart</v>

26
00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>and done what everyone else does is only</v>
<v Speaker 1>licensed it to South Korea and Japan.</v>

27
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>When play came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>at first it didn't have any success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.840
<v Speaker 1>the reviews weren't very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't sell very well,</v>

30
00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and then it sort of picked up momentum</v>
<v Speaker 1>and became a successful record.</v>

31
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>So at first the only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way I had to get people to make</v>

32
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.580
<v Speaker 1>people aware of the music was by</v>
<v Speaker 1>licensing it to movies,</v>

33
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisement.</v>

34
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.940
<v Speaker 1>So we did a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.870
<v Speaker 1>in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I did too much of it.</v>

36
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>There's another ironic aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that at the time people in the</v>

37
00:01:54.691 --> 00:01:57.210
<v Speaker 1>music business be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're musicians or record executives,</v>

38
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>heap scorn on me for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was all the same record</v>

39
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>executives are all working at licensing</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies or they're working at record</v>

40
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>labels where they're desperate to</v>
<v Speaker 1>license anything.</v>

41
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of the musicians who</v>
<v Speaker 1>also criticized me are now bending over</v>

42
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:14.310
<v Speaker 1>backwards and frustrating prostrating</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to try and get their music</v>

43
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>licensed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that unfortunately,</v>

44
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean this in a positive way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sort of the avant garde of</v>

45
00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.250
<v Speaker 1>licensing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.630
<v Speaker 1>I was like the shock troop of licensing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a result I got killed first,</v>

47
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now everyone does it and no one's</v>

48
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>really criticized for it.</v>

49
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

50
00:02:34.171 --> 00:02:35.760
<v Speaker 1>in hindsight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I definitely did way too much of it.</v>

51
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>But the only reason I got involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music business,</v>

52
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>it was because I love music and I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make music.</v>

53
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>And selfishly I'd like people to hear</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music that I make.</v>

54
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not too concerned with the</v>

55
00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>commercial ramifications of producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and producing music and putting it out</v>

56
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>into the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people want to buy my music,</v>

57
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't want to,</v>

58
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>that's fine with me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

60
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 1>my only interest in the commercial side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the music business is to try and get</v>

61
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.320
<v Speaker 1>people to hear the music that I've made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

62
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>so I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't look at the music business and</v>

63
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>think how can I make a lot of money from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>

64
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>I look at it and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I strategically try and get</v>

65
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:22.110
<v Speaker 1>people to hear the music that I've made?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I look at that,</v>

66
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the record companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>falling apart and revenue streams are</v>

67
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.030
<v Speaker 1>dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drying up and royalties or you know,</v>

68
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>a 10th what they used to be for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

69
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't concern me.</v>

70
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some from sort of like a fiduciary</v>

71
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:39.610
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it only concerns me from a musician's</v>

72
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 1>perspective where I just hope that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future I'm able to make music that</v>

73
00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>people will be willing to listen.</v>
