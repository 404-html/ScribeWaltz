1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:10.513
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

3
00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of people don't understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>this at all.</v>

4
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:14.383
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand that in the state of New </v>

5
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.503
<v Speaker 2>York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been very active conservative </v>

6
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 2>party for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

7
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 2>elected Senator Buckley in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>seventies.</v>

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 2>And if you look at the history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>congressional races in New York,</v>

9
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 2>probably a lot of other races I've seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>through congressional races,</v>

10
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 2>the Conservative Party oftentimes </v>
<v Speaker 2>nominates a person historically,</v>

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.113
<v Speaker 2>they've been the good sports that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been willing to step back and throw </v>

12
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:44.474
<v Speaker 2>their support to the Republicans in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest of stopping a more Liberal </v>

13
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Democrat from getting in office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

14
00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.594
<v Speaker 2>what happened in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>23rd was a handful of people got into a </v>

15
00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:01.541
<v Speaker 2>back room and nominated a democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the first thing we heard,</v>

16
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:06.950
<v Speaker 2>for example in my shop at freedom works </v>
<v Speaker 2>was from our grassroots activists in the</v>

17
00:01:06.951 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 2>north country of New York.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>

18
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans have just lost this </v>
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

19
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this woman can't possibly win this race.</v>

20
00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 2>She would not ever want a republican </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary.</v>

21
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.800
<v Speaker 2>She was too liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there's no way she would have won the</v>

22
00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>Republican primary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

23
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was the conservative </v>
<v Speaker 2>party said,</v>

24
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:27.704
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republicans are about to lose his </v>

25
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 2>race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:32.204
<v Speaker 2>and they feel that their candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what happened was there were three </v>

27
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:36.224
<v Speaker 2>candidates from three different parties </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the race to liberals in the </v>

28
00:01:39.621 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 2>Republican and Democrat nominees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one conservative,</v>

29
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 2>the conservative candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although he was a first time candidate,</v>

30
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 2>a quite naive and innocent in the ways </v>
<v Speaker 2>of politics.</v>

31
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.270
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he grew so fast in his standing with the</v>

32
00:01:56.271 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 2>electorate that she got knocked out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the race when she got knocked out of the</v>

33
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did she do?</v>

34
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:06.701
<v Speaker 2>She made a deal with the White House and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chuck Schumer and endorsed a Democrat.</v>

35
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 2>So what did I say?</v>

36
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:09.343
<v Speaker 2>First validation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see aneurysm are grassroots activists </v>

37
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 2>called that correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't they?</v>

38
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 2>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

39
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 2>nominated Democrats and the Conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>Party failed to win that election.</v>

40
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.173
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a short term victory for the </v>

41
00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:22.934
<v Speaker 2>Republicans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can celebrate it all they want </v>

42
00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 2>because a year from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

43
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.443
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats will lose that seat </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the Republicans will have an </v>

44
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.183
<v Speaker 2>open primary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll nominate a conservative </v>

45
00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Republican or at least a middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>road Republican,</v>

46
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>and that person will win the race back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Democrats so that Democrat will</v>

47
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 2>only sit in that office for about a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when that happens,</v>

48
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.324
<v Speaker 2>the Conservative Party will once again </v>
<v Speaker 2>play their role of being in support of </v>

49
00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:52.304
<v Speaker 2>their principals and working the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republican nominee a little bit more to </v>

50
00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 2>their perspective on public and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then helping him beat the Democrat.</v>

51
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Social issues were so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was up there.</v>

52
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean socialists were just simply not </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the debate in that race.</v>

53
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.813
<v Speaker 2>The Democrat candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it was just the two of them and </v>

54
00:03:16.741 --> 00:03:20.160
<v Speaker 2>erase the Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was running a gastro as a big spender.</v>

55
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.330
<v Speaker 2>And so her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her first dress Greshon,</v>

56
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:27.210
<v Speaker 2>whereas she was four,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was four big budgets.</v>

57
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.750
<v Speaker 2>She was for cap and trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was for a card check.</v>

58
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 2>The Mandatory Union plan that denied </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers' a secret ballad.</v>

59
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so she,</v>

60
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.330
<v Speaker 2>she took on economic issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eras and I,</v>

61
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>I saw no discussion of social issues in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that race on economic issues.</v>

62
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.333
<v Speaker 2>She was so liberal that even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democrat was running against her for </v>

63
00:03:53.821 --> 00:03:54.654
<v Speaker 2>being too liberal at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody who are seeking office or </v>

64
00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:03.734
<v Speaker 2>wanting to hold office at some point </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to respond to the voting </v>

65
00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:09.860
<v Speaker 2>constituency whose votes they want.</v>

66
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 2>And right now the Republicans are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>office,</v>

67
00:04:13.131 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 2>are kind of confused about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

68
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:17.533
<v Speaker 2>this tea party movement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what you see right now is most </v>

69
00:04:20.241 --> 00:04:21.074
<v Speaker 2>visible and grassroots conservativism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand points of entrepreneurial </v>

70
00:04:26.121 --> 00:04:27.570
<v Speaker 2>light into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In,</v>

71
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.280
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

72
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 2>advocate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>advocating small government,</v>

73
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:33.770
<v Speaker 2>conservative Islam just popped up all </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the country.</v>

74
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is genuine.</v>

75
00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.580
<v Speaker 2>He largest grassroots movement I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen on a,</v>

76
00:04:40.581 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 2>on particularly the economic issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The office holders are start,</v>

77
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:44.660
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

78
00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.843
<v Speaker 2>If I want to be reelected,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better be responsive to what these </v>

79
00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:50.960
<v Speaker 2>guys are telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where all the energy,</v>

80
00:04:50.961 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 2>there is no greater source of energy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>public policy,</v>

81
00:04:55.791 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 2>discourse and politics today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the small government conservative.</v>

82
00:05:00.261 --> 00:05:01.094
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Orthodox Republican Party is </v>

83
00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:04.214
<v Speaker 2>dispirited and confused and going </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a massive identity crisis where </v>

84
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:10.620
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Basically ask the question is,</v>

85
00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:11.454
<v Speaker 2>who are we and what are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Democrats are inflicted with </v>

86
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.170
<v Speaker 2>probably the most severe case of buyer's</v>
<v Speaker 2>remorse they ever had,</v>

87
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.970
<v Speaker 2>even worse than with the Clintons and 93</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 94 a day,</v>

88
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.550
<v Speaker 2>they have no energy to bring to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>field,</v>

89
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 2>so the field is right now dominated by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the extremely big tent.</v>

90
00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.310
<v Speaker 2>I was small government conservativism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has Democrats,</v>

91
00:05:34.311 --> 00:05:36.110
<v Speaker 2>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independents,</v>

92
00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Libertarians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>evangelicals,</v>

93
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:43.160
<v Speaker 2>people of all stripes and color,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm religious orientation,</v>

94
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.473
<v Speaker 2>and they're all happily joined in </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance to a growth in the power of </v>

95
00:05:50.151 --> 00:05:52.730
<v Speaker 2>the state that they find frightening for</v>
<v Speaker 2>their personal liberty.</v>
