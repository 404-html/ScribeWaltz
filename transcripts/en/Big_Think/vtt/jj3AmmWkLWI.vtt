00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.350
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes good design is one of the</v>

2
00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.590
<v Speaker 1>biggest questions and one of the hardest</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions to answer sometimes people ask</v>

3
00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you decide to put an object in</v>

4
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:17.860
<v Speaker 1>the collection of Moma?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

5
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small collection.</v>

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:21.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about 4,000 objects.</v>

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can talk about anything you want</v>

8
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>form function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these different equations that</v>

9
00:00:27.581 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>they have been given the world as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible definitions.</v>

12
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:34.680
<v Speaker 1>But the truth is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a very complex recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world has become more complex and</v>

14
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you can't any more have an equation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>just two variables.</v>

15
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>There's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a differential equation with many</v>
<v Speaker 1>variables.</v>

17
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>What I can tell you is one of the litmus</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests is think if this object would not</v>

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be a pet?</v>

19
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.240
<v Speaker 1>Would you miss it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tell you,</v>

20
00:00:55.241 --> 00:01:00.241
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helps sometimes objects are not</v>

21
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 1>immediately functional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not to be set upon to be used to</v>

22
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>eat or to be used to turn on the volume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes objects just delivery emotions</v>

23
00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>or are just part of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's also enough,</v>

24
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moment an object seems necessary,</v>

25
00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>then you can move on to judge if it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful,</v>

26
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>if it works well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's a fit,</v>

27
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>wastes energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are all considerations,</v>

28
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of necessity or good</v>
<v Speaker 1>addition to the world really usually</v>

29
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>
