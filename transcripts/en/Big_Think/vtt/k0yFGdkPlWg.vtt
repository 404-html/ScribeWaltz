00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>An interesting statistic with Malawi is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that its forests are being stripped of</v>

2
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>its soft pine because of the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>coffins that are being made because of</v>

3
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>aids related deaths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

4
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just expect this place to be sort of</v>

5
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>gutted and sort of just an inferno of</v>
<v Speaker 1>misery.</v>

6
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>But it was the act opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day the longs that,</v>

8
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that the end of the story is because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the story is long,</v>

9
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:45.441
<v Speaker 1>but I got lost and I was walking on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of a road in Malawi.</v>

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>My cell phone didn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had no idea where I was.</v>

11
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.520
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my guide or the person who was driving</v>

12
00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>me didn't know where I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sure to some of the people who</v>

13
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>were driving past it must've looked</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite strange to see what they call,</v>

14
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I believe I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm deemed Emma Zuniga there,</v>

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.040
<v Speaker 1>which means white person on the side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road.</v>

16
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I kept on walking and I got to this</v>

17
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>gas station and I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could someone help me please?</v>

18
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how to make a phone</v>
<v Speaker 1>call to where I'm supposed to get back</v>

20
00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this woman who worked there came up</v>

21
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>to me and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can help you,</v>

22
00:01:26.551 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>would you like to use my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was probably expensive for her.</v>

23
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>And she found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she helped me get back to where I needed</v>

24
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I was waiting for someone to pick</v>

25
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>me up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.603
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.720
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing here?</v>

28
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm here doing stories about HIV aids</v>

29
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and women and women in Malawi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

30
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we formed this,</v>

31
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>this unusual friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:57.111
<v Speaker 1>and that was like an experience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>really like kind of as a,</v>

33
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>those people that you meet that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed your life.</v>

34
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Like here was this woman who works seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>days a week,</v>

35
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>is a single mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>she finds out while I'm there that her</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter is positive and she's</v>

37
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:15.231
<v Speaker 1>supporting her family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her perspective husband gave her the</v>

38
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:20.811
<v Speaker 1>illness and is outs and laughter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's out spreading this illness as well</v>

39
00:02:22.801 --> 00:02:25.530
<v Speaker 1>among other women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

40
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>at this woman is the most graceful woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever met and the most dignified</v>

41
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.370
<v Speaker 1>woman I've ever met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

42
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

43
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>was so lonely because she couldn't talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her status.</v>

44
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 1>But in spite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just exuded such warmth and such</v>

45
00:02:43.641 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>kindness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>it was really meeting her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really saw the dichotomy of how cold</v>

47
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>her reality was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this beautiful heart that existed in</v>

48
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>all of this and the grace that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed in,</v>

49
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
