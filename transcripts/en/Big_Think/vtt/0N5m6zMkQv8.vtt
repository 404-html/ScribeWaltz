1
00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.493
<v Speaker 1>A few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a leading scientific company had a </v>

2
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.253
<v Speaker 1>specific challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a toothpaste company and they </v>

3
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>make different fluorides for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>toothpaste,</v>

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.793
<v Speaker 1>but there was a big mechanical problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fluoride was getting stuck in the </v>

5
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:20.994
<v Speaker 1>equipment and it wasn't meshing well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The company had engaged all their top </v>

6
00:00:24.721 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>chemists to try to figure out what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem was and no one could solve it.</v>

7
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.903
<v Speaker 1>It was taking months and months and time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and costing hundreds of thousands of </v>

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>dollars at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the executive on the team said,</v>

9
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have not been able to solve this.</v>

10
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.433
<v Speaker 1>Who else could we engage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other networks could help us solve </v>

11
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:44.094
<v Speaker 1>this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the company ended up posting this </v>

12
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>fluoride challenge on a website called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Inno centive,</v>

13
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.023
<v Speaker 1>which is a community of crowdsource </v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists who come together to help </v>

14
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>large companies solve scientific </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Within a few days of posting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fluoride challenge,</v>

16
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>a physicist who lived in Canada looked </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the problem online and said,</v>

17
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.780
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a chemistry problem.</v>

18
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a physics problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about charged particles.</v>

19
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 1>You charge the fluoride one way the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toothpaste the other.</v>

20
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:12.534
<v Speaker 1>Instantly the problem was solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colgate realized a few things from this </v>

21
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:16.794
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing is that they never even </v>

22
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>dare to ask the physicists at their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>company because they had labeled it as a</v>

23
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:24.114
<v Speaker 1>chemistry problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing they realize is that </v>

24
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>physicists that solved the problem may </v>
<v Speaker 1>have never been hired by colgate.</v>

25
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.253
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have the traditional resume.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had had different careers throughout </v>

26
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 1>his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in today's world,</v>

27
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:37.224
<v Speaker 1>we can access and engage expertise in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically different way to find real </v>

28
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:42.474
<v Speaker 1>time solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those that may have the answers are </v>

29
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.164
<v Speaker 1>those that choose to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may not be who we suspect are the </v>

30
00:01:49.531 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 1>right people to contribute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my book,</v>

31
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>get big things done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of connectional intelligence,</v>

32
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.873
<v Speaker 1>my coauthor Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe and I and I distilled connectional </v>

33
00:02:00.181 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>intelligence into five specific traits.</v>

34
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.553
<v Speaker 1>We looked at companies and leaders </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world and found that there </v>

35
00:02:07.081 --> 00:02:07.914
<v Speaker 1>were specific skillsets that you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>use to build your own connectional </v>

36
00:02:11.911 --> 00:02:12.744
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are called the five c's of </v>

37
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:16.254
<v Speaker 1>connectional intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first C is curiosity and we all </v>

38
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>think about curiosity is the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask great questions,</v>

39
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>but from a connectional intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

40
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>curiosity is the ability to design your </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions so that other networks outside</v>

41
00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>of your own can engage to help you solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>those problems.</v>

42
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>solving a problem today,</v>

43
00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>how can you not only be curious to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you traditionally go to,</v>

44
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.093
<v Speaker 1>but how might you design your question </v>
<v Speaker 1>to engage a new community at different </v>

45
00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.014
<v Speaker 1>resource and outside perspective from </v>
<v Speaker 1>another company or even outside your </v>

46
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>industry that could lead to a new and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different breakthrough solution.</v>

47
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.570
<v Speaker 1>The second C of intelligence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination and combination,</v>

48
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>as we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the root of innovation.</v>

49
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.433
<v Speaker 1>Combining disparate ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and resources to come up with </v>

50
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>something entirely new and different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you think about combination,</v>

51
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.374
<v Speaker 1>how are you leveraging your combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills of different resources within </v>

52
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>your company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>across teams,</v>

53
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 1>across business units,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at different levels in different regions</v>

54
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.233
<v Speaker 1>of the organization and far beyond with </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and customers and other </v>

55
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>stakeholders that could help create and </v>
<v Speaker 1>forge new business solutions,</v>

56
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:34.653
<v Speaker 1>new opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and address challenges that you may be </v>

57
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>facing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third C of connectional intelligence</v>

58
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.583
<v Speaker 1>is courage and we all know that courage </v>
<v Speaker 1>is such a key part of all of all of the </v>

59
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:47.314
<v Speaker 1>key ways of connecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I define courage from a </v>

60
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:50.704
<v Speaker 1>connectional intelligence perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really the ability to be able to </v>

61
00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>have difficult in different types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>

62
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.733
<v Speaker 1>but not just raise those conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being willing to amplify and sustain </v>

63
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 1>them over time because we know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a onetime connection doesn't </v>

64
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 1>create breakthroughs.</v>

65
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.573
<v Speaker 1>It's those people that are willing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous to continue those </v>

66
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>conversations over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often it could take years to really lead</v>

67
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.424
<v Speaker 1>to that breakthrough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's that sustaining of the </v>

68
00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>courageous conversation that creates </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

69
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.674
<v Speaker 1>So as you think about your own courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many courageous conversations are </v>

70
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:28.144
<v Speaker 1>you having every day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you sustaining those conversations </v>

71
00:04:31.031 --> 00:04:31.864
<v Speaker 1>over time and what might be those forms </v>
<v Speaker 1>or avenues that would allow you to </v>

72
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:36.604
<v Speaker 1>amplify your own courage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you surround yourself with and </v>

73
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 1>make connections with that makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous yourself?</v>

74
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.653
<v Speaker 1>The fourth C of connectional </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is community and we all </v>

75
00:04:46.781 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>know that community is such a big aspect</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>

76
00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:50.494
<v Speaker 1>Finding different networks of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can care about similar things that </v>

77
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:55.354
<v Speaker 1>can spark ideas together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we found with connectional </v>

78
00:04:58.061 --> 00:04:58.894
<v Speaker 1>intelligence as those that really tap </v>
<v Speaker 1>into this superpower are those that see </v>

79
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.264
<v Speaker 1>communities far beyond traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>forums far beyond the traditional </v>

80
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:07.850
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

81
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.683
<v Speaker 1>So it could be a community of moms in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the company at Unilever that have a new </v>

82
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.150
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about what their </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers might need.</v>

83
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:17.253
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be a network of Latino </v>
<v Speaker 1>employees at Frito lay who realize that </v>

84
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:22.864
<v Speaker 1>there's an opportunity for a guacamole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doritos chips that turned into $100 </v>

85
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.883
<v Speaker 1>million dollar product for the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So communities can be far beyond our </v>

86
00:05:30.941 --> 00:05:31.774
<v Speaker 1>traditional spectrums of what people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles and traditional sources of </v>

87
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:35.344
<v Speaker 1>expertise are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you think about your own </v>

88
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what communities are you involved with?</v>

89
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.193
<v Speaker 1>What informal formal communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what internal and external communities </v>

90
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>do you engage with and how might you be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to leverage them,</v>

91
00:05:47.261 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>not just for what they're traditionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>known for,</v>

92
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>but what other problems they could solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you,</v>

93
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 1>for your team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your company,</v>

94
00:05:55.091 --> 00:05:55.924
<v Speaker 1>and beyond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last C of connectional </v>

95
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is combustion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once you have courage,</v>

96
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 1>curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community combination,</v>

97
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:07.720
<v Speaker 1>it's about how do you allow it to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobilize income.</v>

98
00:06:07.721 --> 00:06:08.554
<v Speaker 1>Bust combustion is the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobilize and curate your communities to </v>

99
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:14.084
<v Speaker 1>create added value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's when you've built your </v>

100
00:06:16.581 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when you've tapped into the courage</v>

101
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:19.963
<v Speaker 1>of that community that allows those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to create value in a new and </v>

102
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.064
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
