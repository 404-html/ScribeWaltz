1
00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that modern jazz</v>
<v Speaker 1>composers,</v>

2
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 1>some names at a middle that come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

3
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>people like John Coltrane when shorter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>there was always directly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Sandra,</v>

5
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm a n,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deep appreciation and even a very deep</v>

6
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:32.710
<v Speaker 1>intuitive understanding of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

7
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm into their music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I like to do for</v>

8
00:00:37.181 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>fun is actually look for those</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>

9
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.540
<v Speaker 1>Like literally I talked to music</v>
<v Speaker 1>composers and it's like this hobby of</v>

10
00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:48.541
<v Speaker 1>mine where I will take a culture in song</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the chord changes and try to relate</v>

11
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>it to music theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm at I'm,</v>

12
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.940
<v Speaker 1>and physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one thing I found interesting is the</v>

13
00:00:57.941 --> 00:01:00.430
<v Speaker 1>notion that culture and came up with was</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called,</v>

14
00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sort of a musical and a musical</v>

15
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:08.710
<v Speaker 1>illusion device in saxophone plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See a saxophone can play more than one</v>

16
00:01:08.711 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>it's monophonic instruments.</v>

18
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what culture was able to do was to</v>

19
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>come up with illusionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects on the saxophone record that,</v>

20
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and it was called sheets of sandy color</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheets of sound.</v>

21
00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Or another thing that he did was he</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out ways in which you can go to</v>

22
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.140
<v Speaker 1>higher notes that the sex is naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't built to make</v>

23
00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>and this user's ideas in physics like</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonlinearity for example.</v>

24
00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>that there isn't always a one to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondence between a wave and a</v>

26
00:01:40.301 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>note.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

27
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.083
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one wave,</v>

29
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>if I add two waves together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a third wave.</v>

30
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>There's not always a one to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>correspondence.</v>

31
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between linear and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonlinear.</v>

32
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>And since music is way of cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is able to figure out techniques to do</v>

33
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:55.240
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways in which,</v>

34
00:01:55.241 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear more than one note at a</v>

35
00:01:57.611 --> 00:01:58.444
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

36
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 1>And how's that relate to physics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.070
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics is exactly an example</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

38
00:02:03.071 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>that a political really can be that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a probability incentive,</v>

39
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 1>a particle being here or here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in a sense it's,</v>

40
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of it as occupying in two</v>

41
00:02:14.321 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>places at the same time until you go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure it.</v>

42
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

43
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:21.310
<v Speaker 1>well that's hard to get your mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

44
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.730
<v Speaker 1>but in a sense that's what the sheets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sound Coltrane was doing was like,</v>

45
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>because you are playing in many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different notes on an instrument</v>

46
00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>that can only play one note at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's this overall effect in which</v>

47
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>all those notes of coexistence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I'm getting,</v>

48
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>what the sheets of sound is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>switching between different individual</v>

49
00:02:48.931 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 1>notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

50
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to play a d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

51
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I want my horn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

52
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>right and I'll play a g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>

53
00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:02.743
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the.</v>

54
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.890
<v Speaker 1>See if I play them very quickly for</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>

55
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>But if culture and figured out</v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative fingerings,</v>

56
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.040
<v Speaker 1>why plan those notes in a rapid</v>
<v Speaker 1>succession that you get an effect?</v>

57
00:03:16.041 --> 00:03:16.874
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like.</v>

58
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.900
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of the example of sheets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of som I'll pissed him off was basically</v>

59
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>the sax normally can just go up to 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>this high f sharp.</v>

60
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.771
<v Speaker 1>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:46.771 --> 00:03:51.771
<v Speaker 1>that's a high f sharp for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you can go further by using a</v>

62
00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:56.940
<v Speaker 1>nonlinear effect by using your diaphragm</v>
<v Speaker 1>down here,</v>

63
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>by forcing the resonance resonance from</v>
<v Speaker 1>down here so I can go up to my highest</v>

64
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.163
<v Speaker 1>sharp.</v>

65
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.903
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

66
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working.</v>

67
00:04:46.701 --> 00:04:46.910
<v Speaker 3>Working</v>

68
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.650
<v Speaker 1>on a little album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Project is almost done and I'm,</v>

69
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.350
<v Speaker 1>the title of the album is call and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the songs inspired by,</v>

70
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my love for grid cool ideas in physics</v>

71
00:04:57.801 --> 00:05:00.380
<v Speaker 1>and how it's connected to jazz music in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

72
00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:03.260
<v Speaker 1>but actually it has a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

73
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.770
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also explores the idea of diversity</v>

74
00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:09.950
<v Speaker 1>and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it uses modern rhythms like a</v>

75
00:05:09.951 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian beat versus a regular Tom b</v>
<v Speaker 1>versus a hip hop beat.</v>

76
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.570
<v Speaker 1>So it uses modern rhythms with jazz</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvisations.</v>

77
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Combined it with themes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say I'm and impressions I'm having</v>

78
00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:25.640
<v Speaker 1>to do with cosmology and particle</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics and string theory and the title</v>

79
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>of the album will be called mathematics</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I grew up in the bronx in</v>

80
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>the eighties hip hop music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 1>there was a part of rap music were guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>who battled each other on the streets.</v>

82
00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

83
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the battle and we'll go into,</v>

84
00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subject matter would be talking</v>

85
00:05:45.771 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>about science for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they even called it dropping</v>

86
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 1>science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Eric,</v>

87
00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:53.360
<v Speaker 1>B and Rakim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I used to take the bus home from</v>

88
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:55.280
<v Speaker 1>school and these guys would be on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>back of the bus,</v>

89
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapping,</v>

90
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>battling each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drop in science,</v>

91
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when one day,</v>

92
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard someone say,</v>

93
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

94
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I got enough mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it also captures a big part of my,</v>

95
00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what inspired me was that I was already</v>

96
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>living in us in sort of a sign that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapping and improvisational rapping and</v>

97
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:19.430
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>things are voluntary in the universe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars exploding that I'm like the star</v>

99
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:25.610
<v Speaker 1>exploding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like this planet rock Afrika</v>

101
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 1>Bambaataa wind the first rap songs out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

102
00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the title of mathematics sort of</v>

103
00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 1>brings it all together.</v>
