1
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think fashion has gotten to a point</v>

2
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>where it's sort of like mini Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>it's actress light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's mellow drama,</v>

6
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

7
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sitcom.</v>

8
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not the full length feature movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fashioned,</v>

9
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>provides a certain drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got the ego,</v>

10
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>it's got the beauty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got the glamor that Hollywood has.</v>

11
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because it's not,</v>

12
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>know we can't get in behind Meryl</v>
<v Speaker 1>Streep's dressing room.</v>

13
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.740
<v Speaker 1>We can't get backstage at the filming of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

14
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>We can't see when camera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

00:00:44.221 --> 00:00:47.550
<v Speaker 1>did it at night and 4:00 in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't want anyone to know</v>

18
00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>and only the director and Charlene's new</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Duh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah.</v>

22
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>we can't get behind the scenes on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

24
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>The celebs won't let you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood won't allow us.</v>

25
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fashion sort of Hollywood light on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level and you can get into a bit of the</v>

27
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>drama and the Glamor and the beauty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood provides.</v>

28
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also,</v>

29
00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:08.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of Ecos,</v>

30
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>so you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get a little bit of the,</v>

31
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you a little bit of the storyline as</v>

32
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.354
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

33
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>They've got to look great and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>their image.</v>

34
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>John Galleano made it out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.500
<v Speaker 1>the slight obscurity when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>his dresses were worn by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>actresses on the catwalk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>on the red carpet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

41
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great symbiotic relationship.</v>

42
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Actresses need to look glamorous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to be photographed and</v>

43
00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>designers want to keep their street cred</v>

44
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>with the general public who's watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Oscars,</v>

45
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 1>who's watching all these celebs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading all the weeklies,</v>

46
00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:46.510
<v Speaker 1>looking at all of the online sites to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see what they're wearing when they go</v>

47
00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:48.180
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they go to award ceremonies.</v>

48
00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.420
<v Speaker 1>the Hollywood end fashion has gotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>into bed together.</v>

50
00:01:52.421 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's working nicely actually for</v>

51
00:01:54.551 --> 00:01:55.384
<v Speaker 1>both of them.</v>

52
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm always riveted by Madonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:01:59.221 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>she continues to more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even at age 50,</v>

54
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>she was backstage at Marc Jacobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had address,</v>

56
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly speechless because I think</v>

57
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>she's got great style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and if not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's got unbelievable balls to have the</v>

59
00:02:15.031 --> 00:02:16.890
<v Speaker 1>style that she wants to have when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to have it.</v>

60
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>So I think she's someone that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>always found to be interesting.</v>

61
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think occasionally Katie Holmes has</v>

62
00:02:24.181 --> 00:02:27.300
<v Speaker 1>had great personal style,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of gracious in the way she gets</v>

63
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>dressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uma Thurman was a model.</v>

64
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>I love her style all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She looks just great in clothes.</v>

65
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:33.931 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>beyonce is sexy and beautiful and route</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I love the way she looks too.</v>

67
00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

68
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I think of a generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blogs are,</v>

70
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to consider ours the cut,</v>

71
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:46.751
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:02:46.751 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>going through the roof and it's record</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking numbers,</v>

73
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during New York fashion week last week</v>

74
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 1>that people are coming more to the blogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good smart ones that have a point of</v>

75
00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>view that tell them the news that</v>
<v Speaker 1>synthesize it also a bit of a,</v>

76
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting edge,</v>

77
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.640
<v Speaker 1>shall we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to,</v>

78
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use the part of cut.</v>

79
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a generational change</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

81
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>that really is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the celebrities are in</v>

82
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.600
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Olson's have great style and</v>

84
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.410
<v Speaker 1>that's an exception to the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>and they're also doing a great line of</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing,</v>

86
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:23.280
<v Speaker 1>kind of cool classics called the row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.101
<v Speaker 1>but in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

88
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes from the designers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that set the trends.</v>

89
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones that create the desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the passion,</v>

90
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:37.711
<v Speaker 1>create the whole aura around what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get or where or see in any given</v>

91
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>season.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

92
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.330
<v Speaker 1>and fashioned traditionally goes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>you're too young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>last fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fall it was about eighties and</v>

95
00:03:47.141 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>leather and tight and sequence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders on belts or forties and more</v>

96
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>conservative version of that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>silhouette.</v>

97
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>And for spring so far it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic.</v>

98
00:03:56.531 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It's quite loose normous amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>texture to fabrics and ruffles or pearls</v>

99
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>or rushing or bright strong color things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are very eye-popping.</v>

100
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing the antithesis of what</v>

101
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>came before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.730
<v Speaker 1>fashion designers tend to be tired of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they've just seen for six months</v>

103
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 1>and they want something completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different and fresh.</v>

104
00:04:14.441 --> 00:04:15.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

105
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 1>if you see a season of black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can bet that the next season's going</v>

106
00:04:18.521 --> 00:04:20.170
<v Speaker 1>to be white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you see a season where it's short and</v>

107
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>tight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can sort of put your money on,</v>

108
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>it might be long and lives um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or looser and slightly more poetic and</v>

109
00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:27.364
<v Speaker 1>it's point of view.</v>

110
00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the designer today that really</v>

111
00:04:33.411 --> 00:04:37.940
<v Speaker 1>designs for women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.600
<v Speaker 1>that's leading the pack on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With that in mind,</v>

113
00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Alvera Barabbas for law va.</v>

114
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.690
<v Speaker 1>I think his ability to design his</v>
<v Speaker 1>technique,</v>

115
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.980
<v Speaker 1>his technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

116
00:04:48.981 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his literal ability to design a dress</v>

117
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>and know how to technically do that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

118
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.420
<v Speaker 1>got many peers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Alabama really understands a</v>

119
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he understands not only her</v>

120
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:03.320
<v Speaker 1>body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her psyche,</v>

121
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.320
<v Speaker 1>how she wants to be alluring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how she wants to feel.</v>

122
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he's really entered into that</v>

123
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 1>space and I therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he designs with that in mind</v>

124
00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.790
<v Speaker 1>along with an unbelievable technical</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to make perfectly beautiful</v>

125
00:05:16.791 --> 00:05:18.260
<v Speaker 1>clothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

126
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>seem effortless and have a great ease</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sensuality that's very,</v>

127
00:05:23.541 --> 00:05:25.340
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very accomplished and very difficult to</v>

128
00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:28.100
<v Speaker 1>come by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would have to give my stars to the</v>

129
00:05:28.101 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 1>man with the most style or ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create that style.</v>

130
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a woman's got to have that style because</v>

131
00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:35.570
<v Speaker 1>she's putting on something that somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>

132
00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think alvero elbaz would be my vote</v>

133
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:38.560
<v Speaker 1>for today.</v>
