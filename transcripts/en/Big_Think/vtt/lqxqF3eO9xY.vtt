1
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I've been working in music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been playing since I was a kid.</v>

2
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the industry itself,</v>

3
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>the first record I ever played on that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a major record was Lauren Hill's</v>

4
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.380
<v Speaker 1>album,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the miseducation of Lauryn Hill back in</v>

5
00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>1998.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was still in college at University of</v>

6
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was a friend of</v>

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence and she introduced me to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was after the success of the score</v>

8
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>by the foods eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so lauren was a big star and</v>

9
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>everyone was anticipating or solo album.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

10
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I went to the studio with them one day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just hung out.</v>

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.433
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>heard me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played a couple songs for her and she</v>

14
00:00:44.791 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>thought it sounded good and wanted me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>play piano on the track she was working</v>

15
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I did it.</v>

16
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>I played on it and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.750
<v Speaker 1>she liked what I did and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>she kept it on the album.</v>

19
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>Song was called everything is</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

20
00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 1>which was a pretty big hit back in 98,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99.</v>

21
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.751
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I was just really proud to be a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an important album and that was my</v>

23
00:01:04.861 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>first entry into the big time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big leagues,</v>

24
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the music business.</v>

25
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>But it was just a session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just play the piano.</v>

26
00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>as I progressed as a writer and as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>singer,</v>

28
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.630
<v Speaker 1>I worked with different producers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some in Philly.</v>

29
00:01:20.631 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in New York and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I put a couple of different variations</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my band together and I just kept</v>

31
00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a record deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.870
<v Speaker 1>I would play at local clubs in New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Philadelphia,</v>

33
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>sometimes Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes DC,</v>

34
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get some buzz and</v>
<v Speaker 1>building an audience.</v>

35
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And it kept building and building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>a couple of years into me living in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>

37
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>I met Kanye West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who at the time was still an unknown</v>

38
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>producer from Chicago who had just moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>out to the east coast.</v>

39
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 1>He was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>he is the cousin of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my good friends,</v>

41
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Devonne Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is also a producer and one of my</v>

42
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>classmates from college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

43
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started working together,</v>

44
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>Kanye and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that was the biggest,</v>

45
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 1>different maker in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

47
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>when I started working with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his star was just starting to ascend</v>

48
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of hitched on to that and,</v>

50
00:02:19.711 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his ascension really helped me get</v>

51
00:02:23.881 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>noticed by the right people and we made</v>
<v Speaker 1>some really cool music together.</v>

52
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Him and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>on his project and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>on my own project and other people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>projects like slum village,</v>

56
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Alicia keys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jay z,</v>

57
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>all these things were happening before I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a record deal and they were helping</v>

58
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>me get the buzz and the energy around my</v>
<v Speaker 1>project that I needed to get a record</v>

59
00:02:46.771 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>

60
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>in 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I signed with Sony through Connie's</v>

61
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:56.571
<v Speaker 1>imprint and I released my first album</v>
<v Speaker 1>get lifted in December of 2014.</v>

62
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It really hasn't changed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.210
<v Speaker 1>we were never close friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

64
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.930
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning it was more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional relationship that developed</v>

65
00:03:09.931 --> 00:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>into a friendship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're still friends and we still,</v>

66
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke around in the same way we did</v>

67
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.700
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still work together in a similar way</v>

68
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.490
<v Speaker 1>that we did before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we still have a respect for</v>

69
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:22.920
<v Speaker 1>each other's creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.330
<v Speaker 1>that we did before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

71
00:03:24.331 --> 00:03:25.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

72
00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I believe Kanye is one of the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important creative minds and music right</v>

73
00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:32.310
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm excited to still be able to</v>

74
00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
