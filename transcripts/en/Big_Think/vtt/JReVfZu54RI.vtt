00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>The piracy paradox is a paradox related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a fashion design.</v>

2
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe related to other things,</v>

3
00:00:10.251 --> 00:00:11.084
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>mostly related to fashion design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paradox arises from the following,</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of puzzle,</v>

6
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>which is we usually think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property protection,</v>

7
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

8
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>as a necessary element for creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

9
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>So writers won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

10
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>If they think there are books are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be copied and musicians won't</v>

11
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>create music if they think their works</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just could be stolen.</v>

12
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>And so that's why Paris is such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about fashion design</v>
<v Speaker 1>is you see a lot of creativity in the</v>

14
00:00:39.981 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>fashion world and yet there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection for fashion designs.</v>

15
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>So dress appears in the runway on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oscars and the next day,</v>

16
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>two days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can buy a cheap version of that from</v>

17
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:55.190
<v Speaker 1>a company like aps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the privacy paradox is looks at</v>

18
00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>this puzzle and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

19
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 1>and the idea is that unlike other</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries in which piracy seems to</v>

20
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 1>drive out creativity in fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't drive it out.</v>

21
00:01:05.361 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to accelerate it.</v>

22
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is that copying of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>copying of designs as it spreads out</v>

23
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:17.780
<v Speaker 1>into the marketplace makes the original</v>
<v Speaker 1>buyer,</v>

24
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>they were the early adopter of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular design,</v>

25
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.210
<v Speaker 1>want to then move on to something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:23.211 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>So fashion's always cycling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one way to think about it is that</v>

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>it accelerates the fashion cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's paradoxical,</v>

28
00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.424
<v Speaker 1>he helpful.</v>

29
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Couple of implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is</v>

30
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>that we probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that our understanding of what</v>

31
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>creativity requires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very instrumental,</v>

32
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 1>one in the US legal system needs to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more nuanced.</v>

33
00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And so when we think of it as a public</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy question,</v>

34
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>to what degree should government provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>these monopoly rights,</v>

35
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:58.930
<v Speaker 1>which is what copyrights and patents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trademarks are.</v>

36
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to think about how different</v>

37
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to be a little more industry</v>

38
00:02:04.121 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rather than a blanket set of rules,</v>

39
00:02:06.911 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 1>we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to understand how these</v>

40
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>industries work and what kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inducements they need.</v>

41
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>So right now there's a bill before</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress to give fashion designers,</v>

42
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of copyright.</v>

43
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably not necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:02:23.201 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there may be other cases in which</v>

45
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:25.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessary.</v>

46
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 2>I think generally</v>

47
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 1>very aggressive about intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>property in the U s we're quiet,</v>

48
00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were quite eager to make sure that other</v>

49
00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>countries protect our intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>

50
00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>And I think generally that's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>helpful to us.</v>

51
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the major producer of movies or a</v>

52
00:02:47.571 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>major producer of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.590
<v Speaker 1>lots of other entertainment industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>software,</v>

54
00:02:51.591 --> 00:02:52.424
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

55
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 1>so intellectual property is essential to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American economy of the 21st</v>

56
00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we've been,</v>

57
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably aggressive about</v>

58
00:02:59.621 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>protecting it in that I think has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>good for our economy.</v>

59
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>But it's not just an economic question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:10.291
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that we ought to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about when we're thinking about</v>

61
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>how much protection should be given is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be in the public domain.</v>

62
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

63
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should be allowed us fair use,</v>

64
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much,</v>

65
00:03:19.871 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>how long should the protection b and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

66
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a fair question to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked about whether we have overshot</v>

67
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.410
<v Speaker 1>what is reasonable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very difficult,</v>

68
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.980
<v Speaker 1>for musicians to sample other songs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more than,</v>

70
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little snippets because the law has</v>

71
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>made it extremely complex and cumbersome</v>
<v Speaker 1>and costly.</v>

72
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.730
<v Speaker 1>And so many people argue that we've kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of gone well beyond what's reasonable</v>

73
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>and made the public domain the domain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that we can all use and remix and</v>

74
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>we create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>really inaccessible in a way that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not optimal.</v>

76
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:00.133
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>And he'd done a couple of things to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>around that.</v>

78
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>One is in the World Trade Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which countries like China are eager to</v>

79
00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>be a part of and they are in fact a</v>
<v Speaker 1>member.</v>

80
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>We've made an electrical property part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that agreement.</v>

81
00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:19.701
<v Speaker 1>So a part of that organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a set of Ip rules that every</v>

82
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>member state of the WTO has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to accept.</v>

83
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And that linkage between trade and Ip</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been very effective.</v>

84
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.810
<v Speaker 1>We do that in our bilateral trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements as well.</v>

85
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>We go and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to trade agreement with us,</v>

86
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Peru or Columbia or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

87
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you have to accept a set of</v>

88
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.520
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property rules and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to enforce them.</v>

89
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.200
<v Speaker 1>so we've used leverage against these</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and,</v>

91
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So China is still,</v>

93
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you can travel in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in Vietnam a few years ago and</v>

94
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>pirated dvds are everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:04:54.121 --> 00:04:55.830
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not perfect.</v>

96
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've been cracking down,</v>

97
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that we hadn't in the past.</v>

98
00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:05.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think that has slowly moved to</v>
<v Speaker 1>these countries closer to our preferred</v>

99
00:05:05.791 --> 00:05:06.624
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

100
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>It's had an enormous effect on piracy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that anything that's digital is so music</v>

101
00:05:17.211 --> 00:05:20.120
<v Speaker 1>downloading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's digital is incredibly</v>

102
00:05:20.121 --> 00:05:21.650
<v Speaker 1>easy to copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore,</v>

103
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:22.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

104
00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.370
<v Speaker 1>the piracy that goes on as is rampant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

105
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:28.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years ago you wanted to copy our</v>

106
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.840
<v Speaker 1>record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a cassette tape,</v>

107
00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:32.630
<v Speaker 1>it was complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a click and you're done.</v>

108
00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So technology has had an enormous effect</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what has driven a lot of the</v>

109
00:05:36.441 --> 00:05:41.390
<v Speaker 1>concern within the u s over increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ip protection and making sure that other</v>

110
00:05:41.391 --> 00:05:44.690
<v Speaker 1>countries in the global marketplace have</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same sets of rules.</v>

111
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has technology been effective in</v>

112
00:05:47.841 --> 00:05:50.570
<v Speaker 1>fighting it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose so,</v>

113
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:53.060
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say I can think of an example.</v>

114
00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:55.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it's primarily been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>been something that's made the piracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem larger.</v>

117
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.130
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's led to a certain kinds of</v>

118
00:06:04.131 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>innovation and industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the VCR came out,</v>

119
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies were very concerned.</v>

120
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:12.170
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>television industry,</v>

121
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>not the case at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

122
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>So it ended up creating a whole new</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

123
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 1>itunes is now this enormous company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:06:20.991 --> 00:06:23.690
<v Speaker 1>or enormous enterprise from apple that</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist.</v>

126
00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so change brings opportunity in every</v>

127
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.410
<v Speaker 1>economic domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Ip is no different.</v>

128
00:06:30.411 --> 00:06:31.820
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is how much,</v>

129
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>how do you balance the incumbent</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries against these,</v>

130
00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>these unknown future things that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't,</v>

131
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>we can't know or predict.</v>
