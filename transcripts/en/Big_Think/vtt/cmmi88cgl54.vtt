1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.890
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.960
<v Speaker 2>so when we sleep and we have an empty</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach,</v>

3
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 2>then the activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the contractile activity of our gut</v>

4
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 2>changes to a very unique pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a 90 minute cycle,</v>

5
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 2>very powerful wastes of contractions</v>
<v Speaker 2>migrate from the Esophagus all the way</v>

6
00:00:24.761 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 2>down to the nfr,</v>
<v Speaker 2>large intestine,</v>

7
00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 2>and they move very slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have been.</v>

8
00:00:33.221 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 2>So this has been referred to as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intestinal housekeeper that sort of</v>

9
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 2>cleans the gut from any residue that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

10
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the rhythm for that is generated by</v>

11
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 2>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's dependent on the input of the</v>

12
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Vegas nerve on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the second brain in the gut.</v>

13
00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.810
<v Speaker 2>And this has been something that also</v>
<v Speaker 2>should occur when during daytime,</v>

14
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:02.320
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in between meals or when our</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach and intestinal system is,</v>

15
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 2>is empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

16
00:01:04.211 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 2>with this sort of modern habit of</v>
<v Speaker 2>snacking in between meals,</v>

17
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people don't have that</v>

18
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 2>during the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have it during sleep.</v>

19
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 2>If you add the microbes into this now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

20
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite likely I'm not really proven</v>

21
00:01:21.131 --> 00:01:21.430
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 2>the microbes obey some kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>circadian rhythm by themselves.</v>

23
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 2>So the different drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep and during daytime,</v>

24
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.360
<v Speaker 2>it's quite plausible to assume that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful waves that sort of cleans</v>

26
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 2>everything out will also affect the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbes,</v>

27
00:01:40.031 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 2>the composition of the microbes because</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we don't have it,</v>

28
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:49.261
<v Speaker 2>so people that don't have that for some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason they will develop</v>

29
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 2>abnormal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm quoting cessation for example,</v>

30
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 2>of the small bowel was a lot of microbes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't really belong there.</v>

31
00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.030
<v Speaker 2>So clearly an important role in</v>
<v Speaker 2>regulating the populations and the</v>

32
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 2>regional distribution of these microbes</v>
<v Speaker 2>now got what happens during sleep,</v>

33
00:02:09.551 --> 00:02:11.470
<v Speaker 2>so during,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during rem sleep,</v>

34
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so on behalf</v>

35
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of activity going on within the</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomic nervous system,</v>

36
00:02:21.431 --> 00:02:25.630
<v Speaker 2>circuits within the brain and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>signals is being sent to the gut.</v>

37
00:02:25.631 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 2>So our bodies inhibited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

38
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 2>but not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not our intestinal activity.</v>

39
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.790
<v Speaker 2>So in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many ways,</v>

40
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 2>emotions they received.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually there'd be experienced visually</v>

41
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 2>in our dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have their mirror image in terms of</v>

42
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>God's activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contractions,</v>

43
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.960
<v Speaker 2>secretions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

44
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:48.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like everything that goes on within</v>

45
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 2>the brain emotionally always is</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflected.</v>

46
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Just like our facial expression reflects</v>
<v Speaker 2>our emotions.</v>

47
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Everything reflects our emotional state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>either waking time asleep,</v>

48
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 2>time at the gut level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Micros who live in that</v>

49
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.590
<v Speaker 2>environment or affected by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

50
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 2>it's an area that's not studied in great</v>
<v Speaker 2>detail,</v>

51
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:14.341
<v Speaker 2>but probably very important for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of how the microbes,</v>

52
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:19.080
<v Speaker 2>the gut and the brain interact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 2>and maintain health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sleep is a very important ingredient</v>

54
00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for health regulation of the immune</v>

55
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the also regulation of the,</v>

56
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.260
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of gut function and particularly got</v>

57
00:03:32.261 --> 00:03:33.810
<v Speaker 2>microbial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

58
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 2>integrity and wellbeing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know quite a bit about what happens</v>

59
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:45.121
<v Speaker 2>during sleep and during dreaming in</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoanalysis,</v>

60
00:03:45.221 --> 00:03:50.221
<v Speaker 2>this is a big window into our emotional</v>
<v Speaker 2>lives.</v>

61
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 2>So Union or in Freudian psychoanalysis</v>
<v Speaker 2>have spent a lot of time interpreting</v>

62
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 2>dreams and getting an access to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this process.</v>

63
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 2>A big portion is probably the processing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and constantly dation of memories that</v>

64
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 2>have been experienced in the day.</v>

65
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 2>Many of these of these memories have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut feeling components because every</v>

66
00:04:16.511 --> 00:04:21.511
<v Speaker 2>time we have an emotion during the data</v>
<v Speaker 2>is always a counterpart at the gut</v>

67
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is then through the sensory</v>

68
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 2>pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes back to the brain.</v>

69
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 2>We may not experience it during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>daytime,</v>

70
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 2>but it's encoded in this vast database</v>
<v Speaker 2>within the brain.</v>

71
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 2>So what happens then during sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this retrieval and then</v>

72
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 2>processing consolidation of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories,</v>

73
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Speaker 2>including all the guts feelings that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with,</v>

74
00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 2>with those experiences that we had</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the day.</v>

75
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a very important point to</v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasize that emotions</v>

76
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 2>have an integrated component of got</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity and got feelings regardless if</v>

77
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 2>we feel it like the butterflies in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach or the knot in the stomach,</v>

78
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 2>every emotion has a component that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain engages got activity and that's</v>

79
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 2>being reported back to the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to look at an emotion really</v>

80
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 2>is a circular process within the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut access,</v>

81
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during sleep and during dreaming.</v>

82
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 2>It's almost certainly a consultation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>processing of these myriad of,</v>

83
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.340
<v Speaker 2>of gut feelings that are generated</v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the day.</v>
