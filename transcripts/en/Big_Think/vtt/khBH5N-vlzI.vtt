00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.593
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They should coexist alongside each</v>

3
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They shouldn't intertwined.</v>

4
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 2>I think part of the difficulty is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>one man's faith is another man's heresy,</v>

5
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 2>or one woman's faith.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's another woman's Harrison.</v>

6
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm the chief rabbi of England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>recently wrote a book called the dignity</v>

7
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 2>of difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jonathan sacks.</v>

8
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>He was actually contemporary of mine at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oxford,</v>

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 2>and he wrote something that has stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me.</v>

10
00:00:32.121 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only one truth in heaven,</v>

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 2>but there are many truths on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

12
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth is supposed to be indivisible.</v>

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

14
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.510
<v Speaker 2>it's binary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either it is or it isn't.</v>

15
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 2>But once you accept that there was more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than one truth on earth,</v>

16
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 2>then you can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has to be my way.</v>

17
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe there's a divine power.</v>

18
00:00:55.101 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a God and God will figure it</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

19
00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.800
<v Speaker 2>but that's in heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so mixing religion and politics,</v>

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.230
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a pretty dangerous admixture in my</v>

21
00:01:06.231 --> 00:01:07.064
<v Speaker 2>view.</v>

22
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
