00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Away from our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Dan price</v>

2
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seasoning to believe that a founding as</v>

3
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that it's not possible</v>

4
00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>to have permanent principles or</v>
<v Speaker 1>semipermanent principles,</v>

5
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but that everything changes with</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

6
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>And so you have something called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>living constitution or a kind of</v>

7
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>historicized constitution that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive's first thought of,</v>

8
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:40.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

9
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early 19th century.</v>

10
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Woodrow Wilson is a great example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.630
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a very popular view</v>

12
00:00:47.631 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet,</v>

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes down to crises,</v>

14
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I think people look at our three</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches of government,</v>

15
00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.180
<v Speaker 1>the separation of powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we have representatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>for limited terms,</v>

17
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>all these fundamental things in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution and hold on to them</v>

18
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 2>lamb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And still,</v>

19
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm still believe that.</v>
