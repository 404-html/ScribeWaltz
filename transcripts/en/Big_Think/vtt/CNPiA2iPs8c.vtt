00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about your four pillars for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>When I was reading that description,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

3
00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:17.360
<v Speaker 1>what came immediately to mind was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>young child that kind of the epitome of</v>

4
00:00:17.361 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>someone who has wisdom of a sort who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder for sure,</v>

6
00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>who's very giving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we now have a lot of research</v>

7
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>that shows that children are naturally</v>
<v Speaker 1>very altruistic.</v>

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a child is kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most mindful person you can have and</v>

9
00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>you even quote the child is father to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man.</v>

10
00:00:35.091 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>You quote that poem in your book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was wondering if you kind of,</v>

11
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you agree with that,</v>

12
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:45.971
<v Speaker 1>if you think that we should be looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to kind of prolong our childhood in</v>

13
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:46.820
<v Speaker 1>a certain way.</v>

14
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea of prolonging our</v>

15
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why making it conscious?</v>

16
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause if that's the difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

17
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Is the fact that it's like returning to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the garden of Eden but with</v>

18
00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:03.890
<v Speaker 2>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a dsl yet by him about,</v>

19
00:01:03.891 --> 00:01:06.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>returning home but seeing it for the</v>

20
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 2>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that I,</v>

21
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 2>I often use as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

22
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.990
<v Speaker 2>as a sort of example of how I want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>react to life that has to do with</v>

23
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 2>genuine is the way children get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset.</v>

24
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>They cry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

25
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Tamper Tantrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then two minutes later it's gone.</v>

26
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a different human being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if we can be like that,</v>

27
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 2>it would be just an amazing way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience life instead of holding on to</v>

28
00:01:37.791 --> 00:01:42.791
<v Speaker 2>resentments and Angus and judgments for</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

29
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.670
<v Speaker 2>And that affecting a whole experience of</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we need to go to kind of to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that extreme in order to be able to</v>

31
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 1>appreciate mindfulness and incorporate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

32
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>we need to kind of experience the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily burnout a severe as you</v>

33
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of the negative things first or</v>

34
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>is it possible to just sail on through?</v>

35
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think absolutely.</v>

36
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:13.031
<v Speaker 2>We can incorporate mindfulness from a</v>
<v Speaker 2>very early age and now increasingly we</v>

37
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 2>see people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean young children being taught to</v>

38
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.230
<v Speaker 2>meditate in order to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a tool that they can use at</v>

39
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:27.071
<v Speaker 2>any point in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My two daughters made a date and they</v>

40
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 2>encourage each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They text each other when one is about</v>

41
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.560
<v Speaker 2>to meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to encourage the other to remember to</v>

42
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many days.</v>

43
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 2>So they're using it as a tool because</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the most blessed at life is going</v>

44
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 2>to include problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges,</v>

45
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 2>tragedies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>

46
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 2>So if we have a tool that allows us to</v>
<v Speaker 2>return to that centered place,</v>

47
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:56.741
<v Speaker 2>we all have every religion mentioned</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zaid every philosopher,</v>

48
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:58.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asking me this call date,</v>

49
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>give me a place to stand and I can move</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

50
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.380
<v Speaker 2>So that place on which we can stand and</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with whatever life brings us up to</v>

51
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just</v>

52
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.750
<v Speaker 2>an incredible adventure to learn to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>back to that place and we don't do it</v>

53
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 2>again and again until we can have easier</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to it.</v>

54
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.760
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
