1
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Sort of roundabout way I got into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story because my,</v>

2
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 1>my great grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister and my great grandmother</v>

3
00:00:13.941 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 1>immigrated to the United States from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovenia in Nineteen Oh,</v>

4
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one weekend my great grandmother's</v>

5
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>sister went to Chicago and was never</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard from again.</v>

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.691
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

7
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always intrigued about this and</v>

8
00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 1>didn't really know much about the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody in my family had any,</v>

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

10
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:30.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traceable information.</v>

11
00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>But I thought it would be interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to explore the circumstances that</v>

12
00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>could have led to her disappearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because I knew Chicago was a pretty</v>

13
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>dynamic and dangerous place at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just started going through</v>

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.260
<v Speaker 1>microfilm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Chicago Tribune Microfilm and 19 and</v>

15
00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>five and came upon the marshal field</v>
<v Speaker 1>junior shooting and was immediately</v>

16
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.400
<v Speaker 1>intrigued by that because it was huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

17
00:00:52.401 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon after coming upon this shooting,</v>

18
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I found the everlys sisters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

19
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>and then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>forgot all about my missing relative</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were so much more</v>

21
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:01.214
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

23
00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>I never cared to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I,</v>

24
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.280
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once I came upon the elderly sisters,</v>

25
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:15.440
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care about finding anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>about her,</v>

26
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>but I got an email a few months ago from</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who said,</v>

27
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dear Karen,</v>

28
00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a stalker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I found your great grandmother and</v>

29
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>the Ellis Island records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I fell,</v>

31
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:33.211
<v Speaker 1>so found another woman named Maria who</v>
<v Speaker 1>came over with her non nine in 1905.</v>

32
00:01:34.881 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 1>But in 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh four.</v>

33
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they both settled in Pittsburgh,</v>

34
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:43.151
<v Speaker 1>which is where my family had settled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person said they tried to track to</v>

35
00:01:43.731 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>see if this woman went to Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was no record of her in</v>

36
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which if,</v>

37
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>if it were her was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

38
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have been surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being that she was a poor immigrant.</v>

40
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if so she did disappear.</v>

41
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>It certainly would have been high on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>police departments,</v>

42
00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>priority list to sort of track down and</v>

43
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:03.140
<v Speaker 1>see what happened to her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the closest I got to,</v>

44
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other clue.</v>

45
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And I assumed that that was probably.</v>

46
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sister is a good question because</v>

47
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 1>they were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>part of their main facet of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>personalities was their ability to sort</v>

49
00:02:21.921 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>of camouflage who they are and to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing who they were and to change</v>

50
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>their backstory so frequently that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody really could pin them down</v>

51
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>and they told people they were from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky,</v>

52
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:35.720
<v Speaker 1>they told people they were from Virginia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they told people they were from</v>

53
00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>Indiana and I was able to pin down that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in fact from this wealthy</v>

54
00:02:40.221 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>family in Virginia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 1>but they had fallen on hard times and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody knew the really sad part of their</v>

56
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was that their father is the one</v>

57
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>who forced them into prostitution at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very young age.</v>

58
00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they of course lead everybody to</v>

59
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>believe that they just decided to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad.</v>

60
00:02:55.631 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm just on a whim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>after sort of coming into an inheritance</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoining a theatrical troupe and,</v>

62
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>and seeing that this might be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>business opportunity.</v>

63
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.811
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

64
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>so there was a sort of sad undercurrent</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their story that,</v>

65
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>that was really interest.</v>

66
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrible.</v>

67
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that they were colored by</v>

68
00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:21.120
<v Speaker 1>their experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being forced to be prostitutes</v>

70
00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.190
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many people who became magnums,</v>

72
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they began in the business like that and</v>

73
00:03:29.221 --> 00:03:33.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that they were subjected to such</v>
<v Speaker 1>degradation that they really would</v>

74
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.570
<v Speaker 1>concern them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they wanted girls that they had not</v>

75
00:03:36.571 --> 00:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to spoil their girls,</v>

76
00:03:38.521 --> 00:03:40.530
<v Speaker 1>not exploit them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to treat them as they wish</v>

77
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:42.030
<v Speaker 1>they had been treated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:03:42.031 --> 00:03:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a large part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing was they saw,</v>

79
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>looked around and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're realists and saw that there</v>

80
00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 1>was not much opportunity for women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is 100 years ago,</v>

81
00:03:51.091 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>women couldn't vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A women couldn't even enter saloons</v>

82
00:03:53.911 --> 00:03:55.170
<v Speaker 1>where politics were discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>there was absolutely no way for women to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enter political discourse or,</v>

84
00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.680
<v Speaker 1>or have a say in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:05.430
<v Speaker 1>and all of these reformers who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to quote unquote help these</v>

86
00:04:05.431 --> 00:04:06.560
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.010
<v Speaker 1>these sisters were actually doing work</v>
<v Speaker 1>concretely to help these women than they</v>

88
00:04:11.011 --> 00:04:11.491
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.420
<v Speaker 1>providing them with food and clothes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

90
00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:15.270
<v Speaker 1>and meals.</v>

91
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Just from me of something funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minnesota,</v>

92
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.130
<v Speaker 1>she said it entertaining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most men in the parlors is more tiresome</v>

93
00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:31.380
<v Speaker 1>than with the girls lose their social</v>
<v Speaker 1>standing over.</v>

94
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

95
00:04:33.091 --> 00:04:34.680
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls were lose,</v>

96
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>lost our social standing by being</v>
<v Speaker 1>promiscuous by being prostitutes.</v>

97
00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 1>A lot of girls in fact were kicked out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their home for being promiscuous.</v>

98
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was such as considered such a</v>

99
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>egregious offense back then that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually be kicked out of your</v>

100
00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>home and a lot of them enter</v>
<v Speaker 1>prostitution.</v>

101
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.851
<v Speaker 1>Figuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:04:50.851 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to be kicked out of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>home,</v>

103
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I might as well be paid for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

104
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a huge stigma.</v>

105
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the elderly sisters,</v>

106
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.060
<v Speaker 1>part of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of their goal was to help girls to</v>

107
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:05.400
<v Speaker 1>reform themselves in terms of returning</v>
<v Speaker 1>them back to polite society if that's</v>

108
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.970
<v Speaker 1>what their ultimate goal was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of their girls ended up after</v>

109
00:05:08.971 --> 00:05:11.550
<v Speaker 1>leaving the club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marrying into wealthy families across</v>

110
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.760
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm marrying senators and prominent</v>

111
00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>businessmen and whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

112
00:05:16.621 --> 00:05:17.770
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there wasn't a stigma.</v>

114
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.020
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a badge of honor to be admitted</v>

115
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.000
<v Speaker 1>into the everly club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

116
00:05:24.001 --> 00:05:25.830
<v Speaker 1>the usual double standard applied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

117
00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:26.730
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

118
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>the everly clubbed seemed to be the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>place where girls could sort of overcome</v>

119
00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:31.074
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

120
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.433
<v Speaker 1>that stigma,</v>

121
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I think part</v>

122
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.520
<v Speaker 1>of their power came from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the fact that they were able to.</v>

123
00:05:43.521 --> 00:05:48.230
<v Speaker 1>So I'm so completely covered there pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the book,</v>

124
00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:51.500
<v Speaker 1>I call them in 19th century amalgamation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Martha Stewart and Madonna.</v>

125
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they just kept reinventing</v>

126
00:05:53.481 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>themselves and reinventing themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I even think that minute in,</v>

127
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>by the time they were older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they believed every lie they ever told.</v>

128
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that they completely bought into</v>

129
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>the idea that they were aristocratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies who had these,</v>

130
00:06:09.281 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>privileged,</v>

131
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>lovely upbringings and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never had a hard day in her life.</v>

132
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that by that point that that's</v>

133
00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>their story and they were sticking to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one really had any right or,</v>

134
00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:21.060
<v Speaker 1>or a reason</v>

135
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.350
<v Speaker 2>to know anything different.</v>

136
00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.150
<v Speaker 1>The early sisters wielded tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and part of the reason they went</v>

137
00:06:33.151 --> 00:06:34.320
<v Speaker 1>into this business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

138
00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.110
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the only viable,</v>

139
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business where a woman could actually be</v>

140
00:06:40.231 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the commander,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the commander in chief,</v>

141
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.910
<v Speaker 1>the CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

142
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the only women did not run in the</v>

143
00:06:48.601 --> 00:06:50.820
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't masters of their domain.</v>

144
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.660
<v Speaker 1>This was the only industry where women</v>
<v Speaker 1>could actually assume a position of</v>

145
00:06:54.661 --> 00:06:57.930
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the everglades sisters were very</v>

146
00:06:57.931 --> 00:06:59.440
<v Speaker 1>powerful in that regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

147
00:06:59.441 --> 00:07:02.670
<v Speaker 1>they dictated who was allowed on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>club and who wasn't.</v>

148
00:07:02.671 --> 00:07:05.340
<v Speaker 1>They had a very specific set of rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

149
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the men paid dearly for that.</v>

150
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:08.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:10.920
<v Speaker 1>the sisters felt that if anyone was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being exploited,</v>

152
00:07:10.921 --> 00:07:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it was the men in this equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

153
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>especially in light of the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way they treated their women and made</v>

154
00:07:18.631 --> 00:07:22.110
<v Speaker 1>sure that the women were never abused by</v>
<v Speaker 1>these men are mistreated by these men.</v>

155
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say the same for other,</v>

156
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 1>for other brothels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

157
00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:26.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

158
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>especially when the men were in charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either there were there,</v>

159
00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:30.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

160
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 1>the exchange of power,</v>

161
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:37.030
<v Speaker 2>much difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This all was one of my favorites</v>

162
00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:41.670
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

163
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.220
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the rival Matt,</v>

164
00:07:44.221 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm the rival Madam to the everly</v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters and,</v>

165
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.530
<v Speaker 1>and sort of was the Queen Bee Madam</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they came to town and,</v>

166
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:52.360
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:54.880
<v Speaker 1>had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had worked her way up and spent quite a</v>

168
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 1>bit of time and effort really</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing herself in Chicago and she</v>

169
00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:02.260
<v Speaker 1>was this scrappy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relentless woman who was not uptown,</v>

170
00:08:02.261 --> 00:08:03.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she didn't even know what I've tabbed</v>

171
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>looked like and she did not at all</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate these two sort of</v>

172
00:08:06.731 --> 00:08:09.040
<v Speaker 1>aristocratic sister sauntering in with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

173
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.010
<v Speaker 1>they're flying ehrs and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of taking what she thought was</v>

174
00:08:12.011 --> 00:08:13.540
<v Speaker 1>rightfully hers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

175
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.680
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you tried to frame them</v>
<v Speaker 1>for murder twice as a,</v>

176
00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:17.821
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

177
00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just couldn't have made her up.</v>

178
00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:22.570
<v Speaker 1>And I always say if there's ever a film</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptation,</v>

179
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 1>a bet midler has to play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vic Shaw,</v>

180
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I actually sent back with a copy of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

181
00:08:28.451 --> 00:08:29.700
<v Speaker 1>but I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:31.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure she's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's going to call me any minute now</v>

183
00:08:31.991 --> 00:08:33.580
<v Speaker 1>and want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

184
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.120
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

187
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.680
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
