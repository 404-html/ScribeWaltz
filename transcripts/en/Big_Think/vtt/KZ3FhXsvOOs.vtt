1
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not far from [inaudible],</v>

2
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>which I mentioned is a ps 28,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is bed Stuy,</v>

3
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:11.900
<v Speaker 1>the other side of Atlantic Avenue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>this is a school where over 40 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the kids are homeless.</v>

5
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principal there is 30 for a highly.</v>

7
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a highly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly effective school,</v>

8
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>high performing school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>the principal there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I took a tour there last year,</v>

11
00:00:26.921 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>she introduced me to his secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

12
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.380
<v Speaker 1>I've trained my secretary to do most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my administrative jobs.</v>

13
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.240
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

15
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I am the lead teacher at the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in classrooms all day.</v>

16
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I work with teachers and I teach the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>

17
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>The teachers don't know how to teach</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I want to make it clear to my</v>

18
00:00:45.971 --> 00:00:48.880
<v Speaker 1>teachers that I didn't become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>principal to escape the classroom.</v>

19
00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>I became a principal to be the leader of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the classrooms.</v>

20
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And I watched her as she interacted</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

21
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.090
<v Speaker 1>with teachers and it was very clear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>she saw them as colleagues,</v>

22
00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:01.660
<v Speaker 1>as part of a team that even though she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was clearly the leader,</v>

23
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 1>she was also there to support them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point I said,</v>

25
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get along with your union?</v>

26
00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me introduce you to my union Rep.</v>

27
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and it was very clear that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners in this effort and working well</v>

28
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:14.590
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what she has is something that is very</v>

30
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>difficult to teach a is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a high degree of social</v>

31
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knows how to work with people.</v>

32
00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 1>She knows how to bring the best out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

33
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>She knows how to read people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand their strengths.</v>

34
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point when I was listening at</v>

35
00:01:29.561 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>she said she took me to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small office where there was an older</v>

37
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>man counseling a little boy.</v>

38
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.310
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that man there?</v>

40
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

41
00:01:40.211 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>I got him from the rubber room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a,</v>

43
00:01:43.961 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>those people who don't know New York or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rubber room is a place where they</v>

44
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:52.861
<v Speaker 1>put a teachers and school staff that</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants and they stay there</v>

45
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:56.410
<v Speaker 1>indefinitely and get paid and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really horrendous situation.</v>

46
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.300
<v Speaker 1>So I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

47
00:01:58.301 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>how did you know to get them out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rubber room?</v>

48
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had been my counselor when I was</v>

50
00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 1>a kid in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I heard he was in the rubber</v>

51
00:02:05.981 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked for him and I bought into my</v>

52
00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I sat in and I introduced myself.</v>

53
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>They introduced me to the little boy who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there talking to him.</v>

54
00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>So I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The counselor said,</v>

55
00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask this little boy why he's here today.</v>

56
00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you here for about eight years</v>

57
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

58
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm learning how to be good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you learn how to be good.</v>

59
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it working?</v>

60
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so because I'm tired of getting</v>

61
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:31.960
<v Speaker 1>in trouble all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what struck me was it was,</v>

62
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a conversation,</v>

63
00:02:33.731 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>it was a friendly conversation going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>between this older man,</v>

64
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.560
<v Speaker 1>his little boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about,</v>

65
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>we're going to throw you out of school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to punish you.</v>

66
00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.430
<v Speaker 1>It was about trying to really get at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>roots of helping this boy learn to</v>

67
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.540
<v Speaker 1>become responsible for his own behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Enough schools do that.</v>

68
00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Students</v>

69
00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>would rather watch a big thing for video</v>
<v Speaker 1>than sit and read a long</v>

70
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 3>page of text in a textbook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have an opportunity to get the</v>

71
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 3>information that they wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily otherwise have.</v>

72
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 3>We're using the technologies to connect,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to learn.</v>

73
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 3>Students can participate by using the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Internet to their advantage.</v>
