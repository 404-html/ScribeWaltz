1
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.300
<v Speaker 1>I was closeted for most of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my adult life.</v>

2
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which alone just that alone was,</v>

3
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people thought a crazy aspiration</v>

4
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>to have because I am Asian and Asians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our adult have many opportunities to get</v>

6
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>cast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus the fact that,</v>

7
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>there were stereotypes that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saddled with either the cold,</v>

9
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.960
<v Speaker 1>heartless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a killer,</v>

10
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

11
00:00:45.521 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inscrutable a person that's got</v>

12
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:53.971
<v Speaker 1>something always going on in the back of</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mind leading to suspicion that a</v>

13
00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>where we could be spies or the survival,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quiet obsequious or the buffoon,</v>

14
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>all very unattractive stereotypes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why I would go into acting,</v>

15
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.540
<v Speaker 1>but something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

16
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm the black sheep of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents thought it was absolutely</v>

17
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they knew how passionate I was.</v>

18
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>And to get cast with first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>this uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.990
<v Speaker 1>ethnic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>barrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hurdle for me to cross A.</v>

22
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to add another one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being gay gay people.</v>

23
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 1>We're not a cast or if they were exposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>as gay,</v>

24
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.170
<v Speaker 1>their career is faded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a teenager,</v>

25
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>there was a very good looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handsome actor named Tab Hunter who was</v>

26
00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>a contract active with warner brothers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost every other movie coming from</v>

27
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:57.961
<v Speaker 1>Warner Brothers start tab hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the heartthrob of America until</v>

28
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 1>confidential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed him as being gay and eventually</v>

29
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.850
<v Speaker 1>he disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was an object lesson for me and so</v>

30
00:02:09.851 --> 00:02:14.851
<v Speaker 1>I was closeted and my career was making</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress and so I did everything to</v>

31
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:21.121
<v Speaker 1>protect my career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant having my guard up all the</v>

32
00:02:21.611 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being careful about the pronouns I used,</v>

33
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>a denying some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good portion of who I was.</v>

34
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.170
<v Speaker 1>It was a very uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a way to live,</v>

35
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>except when you're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a part of your normal</v>

36
00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lived that uncomfortable existence as</v>

37
00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>what I thought was going to be my life.</v>

38
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to go to gay bars in Los Angeles</v>

39
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:57.110
<v Speaker 1>back then and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>it was a wonderful place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guard can come down.</v>

41
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>I could make friends as who I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to really relax and enjoy</v>

42
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>friendship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>camaraderie,</v>

43
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wonderful evening or an afternoon.</v>

44
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:23.040
<v Speaker 1>But one of the older people told me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>periodically the police would raid gay</v>

45
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>bars and they would march the clients</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

46
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 1>put them on a patty wagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drive them to the police station,</v>

47
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>fingerprint them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>photograph them,</v>

48
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.080
<v Speaker 1>and their names were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be put on a list.</v>

49
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>It was terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their lives can be destroyed.</v>

50
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>They could lose their jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps their families.</v>

51
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>It was a horrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what were they doing?</v>

52
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:59.400
<v Speaker 1>A criminal activity according to the law</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time being gay was criminalized.</v>

53
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>We were marched out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put into paddy wagons and registered.</v>

54
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's no different.</v>

55
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Different than what happened to me when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was child because of this face,</v>

56
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>because we look like the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bombed Pearl Harbor.</v>

57
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.080
<v Speaker 1>We were put into prison camps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarded over by,</v>

58
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers with machine guns pointed down</v>

59
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>that is from century towers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the same thing.</v>

60
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.860
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was wrong,</v>

61
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>unjust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet that was the way we had to live</v>

62
00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>those few isolated moments when we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be ourselves.</v>

63
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.820
<v Speaker 1>And then stonewall happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the people they're resistant,</v>

64
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>they decided they had enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to take it anymore,</v>

65
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:58.110
<v Speaker 1>and that was the galvanizing event and</v>
<v Speaker 1>society began to change,</v>

66
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.450
<v Speaker 1>and by the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>things were really starting to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

68
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:12.610
<v Speaker 1>the State Supreme Court of Massachusetts</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruled that marriage equality was</v>

69
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>constitutional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was the first state.</v>

70
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Two years later on the other coast in</v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

71
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.880
<v Speaker 1>the People's representatives this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the legislative route,</v>

72
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>both houses of the California</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislature,</v>

73
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>the assembly and the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed the marriage equality bill.</v>

74
00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 1>All that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that bill needed was a signature of the</v>

75
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.921
<v Speaker 1>governor to become the law of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been two states book</v>

76
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 1>ending America with marriage equality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The governor at that time happened to be</v>

77
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>a movie star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwartzenegger.</v>

78
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>When he campaigned for that office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told the public,</v>

79
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm from Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with gays and lesbians.</v>

80
00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of my best friends are gays and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbians,</v>

81
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:10.480
<v Speaker 1>and persuaded by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of my gay friends did vote for</v>

82
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:11.834
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

83
00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:17.820
<v Speaker 1>Yet when that bill landed on his desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he acted as the representative of this</v>

84
00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:25.030
<v Speaker 1>base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right wing of the Republican Party.</v>

85
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>And he vetoed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was raging,</v>

86
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>but I had trained my body muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holding that rage and that night brad</v>

87
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:43.981
<v Speaker 1>and I were watching the late night news</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I saw all these young people pouring</v>

88
00:06:44.381 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>out on the Santa Monica Boulevard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>venting their rage on our no</v>

89
00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:53.511
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger and we felt the same way</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it got us to thinking and talking</v>

90
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>and Brad and I discussed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 68 years old by that time and I</v>

91
00:07:05.951 --> 00:07:06.784
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I want my life to have some meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want the time that I have left to do</v>

93
00:07:15.161 --> 00:07:18.400
<v Speaker 1>something about that aspect of who we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>

94
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.150
<v Speaker 1>And so I spoke to the press for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first time as a gay man and I blasted</v>

95
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>Arnold Schwarzenegger's veto and what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of my career,</v>

96
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.590
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was going to go on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>downhill side.</v>

97
00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 1>The opposite happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just lost and I've been working more</v>

98
00:07:41.621 --> 00:07:45.670
<v Speaker 1>since coming out then I had been when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was closeted.</v>
