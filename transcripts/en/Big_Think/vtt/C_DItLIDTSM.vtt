1
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 2>got very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little to do with the construction</v>

3
00:00:15.711 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 2>of the welfare state economic model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one element of the economic</v>

4
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 2>model that was fundamentally flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are the fixed exchange rate policy</v>

5
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 2>and that was untenable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We try to defend the fixed exchange rate</v>

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 2>with interest rates up to 500 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was ridiculous.</v>

7
00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 2>It was a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we were so</v>

8
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 2>indoctrinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had lived with a fixed exchange rate</v>

9
00:00:43.201 --> 00:00:48.201
<v Speaker 2>regime all our lives since the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>thirties and we could not imagine that</v>

10
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.430
<v Speaker 2>was something wrong with the fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 2>element of our economic policy.</v>

11
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.170
<v Speaker 2>When that was abolished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy took off and we've had much</v>

12
00:00:57.171 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>more flexible situation since then and</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

13
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.280
<v Speaker 2>It is one of the fundamental assets of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our economy that we are flexible enough</v>

14
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 2>to set interest rates according to our</v>
<v Speaker 2>own needs,</v>

15
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 2>high interest rates if you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>overheating innovation and can stimulate</v>

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 2>by low interest rates when recession is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that threatening,</v>

17
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 2>and I think that was one of the main</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of the shocks that we</v>

18
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 2>experienced in the late eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had a shock from the financial</v>

19
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 2>markets and as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial markets destabilized.</v>

20
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 2>They don't stabilize ID stabilize</v>
<v Speaker 2>economies,</v>

21
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>the destabilized our economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could not do anything about it</v>

22
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 2>because we did not have in our</v>
<v Speaker 2>possession the interest rate weapon</v>

23
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>because we had a fixed exchange rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>regime and I think that was a much more</v>

24
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 2>important explanation.</v>
