1
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>So as an entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a ted and Tedx speaker,</v>

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>as an award winning author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as someone who was named USA Today's</v>

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>most connected millennial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people ask me how I have built</v>

4
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:18.030
<v Speaker 1>my network and how I connect with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>And so I'll give you the high level and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I'll go into maybe a few specifics</v>

6
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>that you can use today to build a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>class network in record time.</v>

7
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>At a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think about networking in,</v>

8
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>in three basic steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step one,</v>

9
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 1>which shouldn't even have to be told or</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared,</v>

10
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>is that you should be a good person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole process of building your</v>

11
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is probably easy at first.</v>

12
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.271
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

13
00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>you bump into someone at a coffee shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run an event.</v>

14
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Obviously you want to treat them with</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect.</v>

15
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>Treat them like you would treat your mom</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

16
00:00:51.181 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I was told recently that I</v>

17
00:00:52.891 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>really like a [inaudible] shows like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of respect that you should have</v>

18
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>for someone regardless of who they look</v>
<v Speaker 1>like or who they are.</v>

19
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

20
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Just treat everyone the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>be a good person and if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're coming at it being a good</v>

22
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>person instead of being selfish or</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to win a quick contract over</v>

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:15.990
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll have a much better job</v>

24
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>in terms of building your network and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you become a super connector,</v>

26
00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to want to be more</v>

27
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>intentional about how you spend your</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and so they're going be more people</v>

28
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.010
<v Speaker 1>reaching out to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to connect with you,</v>

29
00:01:29.011 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's important to treat them</v>
<v Speaker 1>respectfully and be a good person with</v>

30
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe someone who is less knowledgeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you reaching out.</v>

31
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>Even if you can't spend a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

32
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a respectful way to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's a respectful way to,</v>

33
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to anyone regardless of if you end</v>

34
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.430
<v Speaker 1>up spending time with them or not.</v>

35
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>step one,</v>

36
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>be a good person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A step two is to provide value upfront.</v>

37
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you are building friendships,</v>

38
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>connecting with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to ask about what they</v>

39
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>care about and what they're working on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's keeping them up at night.</v>

40
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.620
<v Speaker 1>See if you can offer connections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are offered time or resources in order</v>

41
00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>to move their agenda forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the same in marketing.</v>

42
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to offer a potential customer</v>
<v Speaker 1>value before you try and ask them for</v>

43
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>money or ask them for value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In return.</v>

44
00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>It's the same with sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to build rapport and really</v>

45
00:02:17.581 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>establish a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's important with mentors as well</v>

46
00:02:20.821 --> 00:02:25.821
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of times if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaching out to find a mentor or you're</v>

47
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:29.100
<v Speaker 1>reaching out to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone important in your industry,</v>

48
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>they're fielding a lot of the same sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of requests from other individuals who</v>

49
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>want their time and want their expertise</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you could stand out by looking to</v>

50
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>offer value to them and actually being</v>
<v Speaker 1>proactive about what it is they're</v>

51
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:43.044
<v Speaker 1>working on.</v>

52
00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

53
00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I've reached out to New York Times</v>
<v Speaker 1>bestselling authors right before they're</v>

54
00:02:47.971 --> 00:02:51.660
<v Speaker 1>about to come out with another book and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know that they are looking for</v>

55
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>introductions to press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that they are really busy and so</v>

56
00:02:55.351 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>anything I can do to help them advance</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book that they're working on or save</v>

57
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>them time is really valuable to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I would think about,</v>

58
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>always being a good person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>providing value upfront.</v>

60
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>And then number three is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>intentional about who you're trying to</v>

61
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 1>build relationships with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That level of intentionality I think is</v>

62
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>missing for a lot of us in today's Day</v>
<v Speaker 1>and age.</v>

63
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>There's so much noise coming at us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many pings coming through our</v>

64
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>smartphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.070
<v Speaker 1>but if you're looking to build a world</v>
<v Speaker 1>class network and do it in a short</v>

66
00:03:27.071 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have to be intentional about</v>

67
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>what types of people you want in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

68
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.890
<v Speaker 1>who you want to learn from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>and how you're going to give yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to different networks.</v>

70
00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>I like to spend as much time as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people that are super connectors,</v>

72
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>meaning they are well regarded in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

73
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 1>They have high integrity and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>also in a hub or an access point to a</v>

74
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>bunch of other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In their industry,</v>

75
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.420
<v Speaker 1>and so I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>two or three Olympians and if I ever had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reason to reach out to more Olympians,</v>

77
00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>I would go through those two or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

78
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:02.530
<v Speaker 1>but I was a good person and meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

79
00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I provided them value upfront and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>I have a friendship with them that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows me access to a bunch of other</v>

81
00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Olympians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same with the world of authors.</v>

82
00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Same with a lot of fortune 500 c suite</v>
<v Speaker 1>executives.</v>

83
00:04:14.081 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>I know they all know each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you can build a relationship</v>

84
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>with people who are super connectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you access to a lot of other</v>

85
00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>people in their network if and when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need it.</v>

86
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>And then if and when you can provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>value to people in their network and you</v>

87
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:29.470
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along the way you've gotta make sure</v>

88
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you're a good person and keep your</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation solid.</v>

89
00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at a high level,</v>

90
00:04:33.911 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>that's how I would go about thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about networking,</v>

91
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.190
<v Speaker 1>relationship building.</v>
