1
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Fascinatingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story of how hip hop happened is</v>

2
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>actually the story of how innovation has</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in kind of every dimension,</v>

3
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>every industry you can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's this thing called cognitive</v>

4
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>friction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the friction between different</v>

5
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>ideas or different ways of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that actually produce a path</v>

6
00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>forward that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that helps kind of any industry become</v>

7
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>innovative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was especially fascinated by the story</v>

8
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:37.731
<v Speaker 1>of the Wu Tang clan and how they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>this in particular when they got nine</v>

9
00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine Alpha males with big egos together</v>

10
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>to form a rap group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which on the face of it actually sounds</v>

11
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>like a terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're different styles of rap in the</v>

12
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.340
<v Speaker 1>early sort of early days of hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

13
00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of all over the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>some more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more emotional.</v>

15
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Others were more lyrical and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>all very different.</v>

16
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:02.910
<v Speaker 1>And so you can just imagine the conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>that erupts out of this.</v>

17
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>And then they got in the record studio</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and they nearly killed each</v>

18
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this was because they were</v>

19
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>essentially extensively enemies and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least didn't have a whole lot of</v>

20
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>trust between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main guy who got them together,</v>

21
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>his name was Robert Diggs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came up with this very clever plan.</v>

22
00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Basically he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will make a beat.</v>

23
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll make a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then everyone has to show up and</v>

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>compete for the song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you show up with your lyrics,</v>

25
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>with your rhymes and you get on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>microphone and whoever does the best</v>

26
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on the track or you're on this</v>

27
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.960
<v Speaker 1>part of the track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he did this and he basically</v>

28
00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>channeled this aggressive energy and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these sort of different ways of</v>

29
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.480
<v Speaker 1>operating in hip hop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he got them all to instead of</v>

30
00:01:45.481 --> 00:01:50.481
<v Speaker 1>fighting with each other to fight for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the record and to kind of elevate this</v>

31
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

32
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>And what came out of this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratory as like Adam smashing</v>

33
00:01:55.591 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>together and creating this great heat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this great energy and out of this was</v>

34
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>born the greatest hip hop group of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

35
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>That many consider it that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is actually exactly what</v>

36
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:11.991
<v Speaker 1>happened with hip hop in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hip Hop started with Djs throwing these</v>

37
00:02:12.271 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>parties where everyone who showed up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the party,</v>

38
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>you danced on one side of the dance hall</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the other,</v>

39
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>depending on which music you like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best.</v>

40
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>So the djs would bring different music</v>
<v Speaker 1>every week to try and lower the party to</v>

41
00:02:23.551 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>their side or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is some sort of fun party game.</v>

42
00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And what happened is when the DJ's</v>
<v Speaker 1>announcers started competing over the</v>

43
00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>best way to sort of drag people to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the party,</v>

44
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.570
<v Speaker 1>suddenly that turned into a battle where</v>
<v Speaker 1>week after week the announcers,</v>

45
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>the MCS would try and come up with more</v>
<v Speaker 1>clever things to say.</v>

46
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.960
<v Speaker 1>And it eventually turned into this kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war of words and music.</v>

47
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.980
<v Speaker 1>And in fact also a war of dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was awesome about it is</v>

48
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>everyone was in it for the party for</v>
<v Speaker 1>making this party better,</v>

49
00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>making this event awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people started bringing tape</v>

50
00:03:00.281 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>recorders to record this music that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>being invented essentially on the spot.</v>

51
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Because it was so great and you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>show up to this party next week after</v>

52
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>having lost the lyric battle with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same lyrics,</v>

53
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you showed up with something different</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in fact,</v>

54
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>all of the djs started hacking their</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment so they could do more clever</v>

55
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how we invented fader switches</v>

56
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things that are now standard stock</v>

57
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>for any kind of Dj or any kind of party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also cracked open their equipment</v>

58
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>and added more memory when they started</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing electronic music so that they</v>

59
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>could have an edge in this battle.</v>

60
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently Jay z was interviewed by,</v>

61
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by David letterman about these days and</v>

62
00:03:40.421 --> 00:03:45.421
<v Speaker 1>he said that it was all about making</v>
<v Speaker 1>this experience awesome for the people</v>

63
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>who showed up that night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't about killing the other guys,</v>

64
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>even if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your lyrics were about making fun of the</v>

65
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 1>other guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about providing a great</v>

66
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so this battle elevated this whole</v>

67
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.820
<v Speaker 1>thing and out of it was born hip hop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rnb and you know,</v>

68
00:04:00.821 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>all of the music that's sort of stemmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that.</v>

69
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.860
<v Speaker 1>All the culture that stemmed from that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same thing that happened</v>

70
00:04:05.861 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>with the Wu Tang clan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They cleverly channeled all of these</v>

71
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>different kind of approaches to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and made something better,</v>

72
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think that this is an analogy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can not only see in the history of</v>

73
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>innovation in science and art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and politics,</v>

74
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>but an analogy for what we should shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>for in our own work,</v>

75
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>for how we can get better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the friction that the different</v>

76
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>approaches doing battle and smashing</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

77
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>If we can make sure that they don't go</v>
<v Speaker 1>too far or we turn it into something,</v>

78
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:39.271
<v Speaker 1>it's about destroying someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we think of it all as part of our</v>

79
00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>collaboration process to elevate our</v>
<v Speaker 1>craft,</v>

80
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>then we can go much further than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we can on our own.</v>
