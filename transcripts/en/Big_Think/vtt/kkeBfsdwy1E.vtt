20
00:01:04.301 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>we'll start with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>essentially this is a follow on to</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I have some questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got other questions from members</v>

26
00:01:24.311 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 1>of mentors community and we'll start</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

27
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sid,</v>

28
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and said if you'd like to introduce</v>

29
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>yourself would say a couple of words</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what brought you to mentor or</v>

30
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.151
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're,</v>

32
00:01:37.991 --> 00:01:39.520
<v Speaker 1>what you're up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:42.580
<v Speaker 1>and then go ahead and ask Maria your</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

35
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw just,</v>

36
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.053
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

37
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Sid Burgess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm just kind of addicted to the</v>

38
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:51.230
<v Speaker 3>notion of trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

39
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 3>hone a personal skills to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

40
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 3>improve your life and day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

41
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 3>just I enjoy the topic in general.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I've been a big fan of,</v>

42
00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the channel and even before you guys,</v>

43
00:02:01.411 --> 00:02:02.630
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

44
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 3>went to a big thing for mentors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really kind of excited to be a part</v>

45
00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:06.570
<v Speaker 3>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

46
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a question just to kind of kick</v>

47
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 3>things off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really was curious,</v>

48
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.723
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

49
00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the mentors was wanting to get</v>

50
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 3>out of this whole experience themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we sort of are used to kind of receiving</v>

52
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:22.920
<v Speaker 3>this feedback or receiving this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these good ideas,</v>

53
00:02:22.921 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 3>but part of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the,</v>

54
00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>part of the brilliance of this whole</v>

55
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 3>kind of community is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that everybody's kind of is getting</v>

56
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 3>something out of it too as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I was just kind of curious from your</v>

57
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you looking to get out of a big</v>

58
00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:35.394
<v Speaker 3>thing to mentor?</v>

59
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking to get out of it.</v>

60
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a wonderful question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Questions just like the one that you</v>

61
00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 2>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you really have,</v>

62
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who interact with you and who ask</v>

63
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>new questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've look at things in a different way</v>

64
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:53.300
<v Speaker 2>and it makes you think about topics that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't think about otherwise,</v>

65
00:02:53.301 --> 00:02:55.880
<v Speaker 2>which I think is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>

66
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 2>whenever I answer questions from</v>
<v Speaker 2>readers,</v>

67
00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 2>whenever I give talks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>answer questions from the audience,</v>

68
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.871
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

69
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 2>there are always questions that repeat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's always something new.</v>

70
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh,</v>

71
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 2>that's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I start thinking about it and</v>

72
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 2>it lets me develop my ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of like the Holmes Watson</v>

73
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 2>relationship actually to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.750
<v Speaker 2>kind of bring it back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Watson really improves</v>

75
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Holmes's thinking and Holmes becomes</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better throughout the stories.</v>

76
00:03:23.501 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>The more he interacts with Watson</v>
<v Speaker 2>because Watson asks provocative</v>

77
00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he always forces homes to stop and think</v>

78
00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 2>why he's doing what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of back and forth is</v>

79
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:36.890
<v Speaker 2>incredibly important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

80
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>to keep your thinking sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep yourself stimulated.</v>

81
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that anyone should ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>really work in a bathroom even though</v>

82
00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>writing is often a very solitary</v>
<v Speaker 2>profession.</v>

83
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 2>But that interaction I think is</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly important.</v>

84
00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.810
<v Speaker 3>Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want me ask my second question?</v>

85
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.590
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright,</v>

86
00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.900
<v Speaker 3>so the second one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

87
00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.780
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

88
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.290
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've actually had a kind of mulling</v>

89
00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:06.020
<v Speaker 3>around in my mind for a while as this</v>
<v Speaker 3>notion of,</v>

90
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 3>of being too distracted and multitasking</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you brought it up in one of your</v>

91
00:04:10.791 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I really wanted to ask you this</v>

92
00:04:12.381 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 3>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy going.</v>

93
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.230
<v Speaker 3>That's my favorite place in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It really doesn't matter which one it</v>

94
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:19.580
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the coffee shop.</v>

95
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 3>I just enjoy sitting in the coffee shop</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just kind of watching the world go</v>

96
00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:25.370
<v Speaker 3>by and people watching as we like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

97
00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:28.820
<v Speaker 3>but almost more than that too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just enjoy kind of just a,</v>

98
00:04:28.821 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 3>almost in a sense of meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just taking in all the sights and sounds</v>

99
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:37.100
<v Speaker 3>of whatever city that I'm in and trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to process them almost simultaneously.</v>

100
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.560
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to just ask you how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how would you,</v>

101
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.360
<v Speaker 3>how would you describe maybe in a way</v>
<v Speaker 3>that would help help improve that,</v>

102
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that mental,</v>

103
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.670
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exercise and the way that differentiates</v>

104
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:54.230
<v Speaker 3>that from kind of the multitasking or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the endorphin driven kind of electronic</v>

105
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.970
<v Speaker 3>distraction?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

106
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.410
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we hear a lot about.</v>

107
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Can you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can maybe differentiate the two a</v>

108
00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 3>little bit and maybe how we can focus it</v>
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

109
00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.293
<v Speaker 3>on the better one?</v>

110
00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.190
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what you like to do is definitely not</v>

111
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 2>multitasking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

112
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 2>that's kind of unitasking at its best</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing something very</v>

113
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:13.650
<v Speaker 2>specific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of watching or letting your</v>

114
00:05:13.651 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 2>senses take everything in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the,</v>

115
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 2>the myth about multitasking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

116
00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't be looking at multiple things</v>
<v Speaker 2>at once and have that not be</v>

117
00:05:24.751 --> 00:05:27.810
<v Speaker 2>multitasking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be doing multiple activities</v>

118
00:05:27.811 --> 00:05:29.640
<v Speaker 2>at once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So their brain can't be thinking,</v>

119
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.320
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to do this,</v>

120
00:05:31.321 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 2>but also I want to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

121
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also I'm focused on what I'm going</v>

122
00:05:36.781 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 2>to order at the coffee shop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm going to have for lunch,</v>

123
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>what I'm going to do after I leave the</v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee shop,</v>

124
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.200
<v Speaker 2>what else I have planned for this city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you were thinking all of these things</v>

125
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 2>at the same time and then you'd be</v>
<v Speaker 2>multitasking,</v>

126
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>but if you're kind of in the moment and</v>
<v Speaker 2>just soaking everything in using all of</v>

127
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:57.030
<v Speaker 2>your senses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really sensory taking in the,</v>

128
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 2>in a very mindful fashion.</v>

129
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the purpose of,</v>

130
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of mindfulness.</v>

131
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.920
<v Speaker 2>So I think those are two very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different experiences.</v>

132
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>And in order to really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think do get a lot of out of what you</v>

133
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 2>do and get more out of that type of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people watching,</v>

134
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.090
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is really interesting and</v>

135
00:06:17.091 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And helps you develop as a,</v>

136
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>as a person and develop your thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and develop your powers of observation</v>

137
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>is really realize that that's exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're doing and do your best to</v>

138
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 2>avoid distracting thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you see someone and that puts your</v>

139
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:36.290
<v Speaker 2>mind along the lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

140
00:06:36.291 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that person reminds me of my friend x</v>

141
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 2>and settling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about fed x in your mind</v>

142
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.510
<v Speaker 2>is going on a tangent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize that that's happening.</v>

143
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:48.020
<v Speaker 2>Stop yourself and come back to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>observing and taking everything in.</v>

144
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that's how you can make the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of that experience.</v>

145
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

146
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have other questions from other mentor</v>

147
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>members who would have liked to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been with us today but could not for</v>

148
00:07:02.751 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>technical reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

149
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got Matthew J.</v>

150
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Clark is asking what are the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories about why tasks switching</v>

151
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:16.740
<v Speaker 1>causes fatigue?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

152
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that's how he worded the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And unfortunately,</v>

153
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.820
<v Speaker 1>folks aren't here to do follow up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

154
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.610
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we know that attention is an</v>

155
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 2>incredibly finite resource.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's really only so much of it to</v>

156
00:07:28.661 --> 00:07:32.230
<v Speaker 2>go around and we can train our intention</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that we become better,</v>

157
00:07:32.231 --> 00:07:34.450
<v Speaker 2>but we'll never be able to make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>incident.</v>

158
00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the things that tasks</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in does is use that mental energy.</v>

159
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>So you need resources to switch your</v>
<v Speaker 2>focus from one thing to another.</v>

160
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 2>And the theory is actually is very</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple.</v>

161
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.280
<v Speaker 2>The more your mind is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more resources it needs.</v>

162
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 2>And so every time you switch your</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention who are actually switching</v>

163
00:07:55.211 --> 00:07:57.700
<v Speaker 2>circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're switching your focus,</v>

164
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.420
<v Speaker 2>you're switching kind of the neural</v>
<v Speaker 2>mechanisms behind it and that expense</v>

165
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 2>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally you can replenish it by having</v>

166
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:06.940
<v Speaker 2>glucose or other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

167
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.390
<v Speaker 2>other things that actually boosts your</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy levels.</v>

168
00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very literal thing that happens.</v>

169
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Your brain is actually getting tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're actually using resources and</v>

170
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:22.081
<v Speaker 2>you're actually becoming less able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things because you use those</v>

171
00:08:22.541 --> 00:08:26.290
<v Speaker 2>resources for the task switching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you no longer have them to pay</v>

172
00:08:26.291 --> 00:08:28.120
<v Speaker 2>attention to the tasks that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

173
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of really interesting work</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shows that people who multitask</v>

174
00:08:32.681 --> 00:08:37.681
<v Speaker 2>frequently are less efficient at task</v>
<v Speaker 2>switching because they're always the,</v>

175
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:42.430
<v Speaker 2>they don't know how to take those</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources and really use them to their</v>

176
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:45.490
<v Speaker 2>full potential,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is really fascinating</v>

177
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.480
<v Speaker 2>because it ends up that heavy</v>
<v Speaker 2>multitaskers become worse at the very</v>

178
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:51.460
<v Speaker 2>thing that they should be very good at.</v>

179
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.090
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

180
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've read some of that research and it's</v>

181
00:08:55.561 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>fascinating because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of plugged in millennial folks</v>

183
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>who you would think would be the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>step at this actually the more they</v>

184
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:05.610
<v Speaker 1>multitask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems the worst.</v>

185
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become a worse that being able to</v>

186
00:09:09.371 --> 00:09:11.560
<v Speaker 2>filter out distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

187
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.580
<v Speaker 2>and that's a good thing if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure that you're paying attention</v>

188
00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:18.220
<v Speaker 2>to everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also get off task very,</v>

189
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.630
<v Speaker 2>very frequently in very easily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not a good thing.</v>

190
00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.780
<v Speaker 2>So not being able to filter out</v>
<v Speaker 2>distractions can make them worse at task</v>

191
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:31.510
<v Speaker 2>switching to the tasks you actually want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be switching to,</v>

192
00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.971
<v Speaker 2>Something I'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:09:33.971 --> 00:09:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was this distraction.</v>

195
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'll do that instead.</v>

196
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>So in this regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that sort of,</v>

197
00:09:39.991 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 1>we're all doomed given the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.740
<v Speaker 1>tech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological,</v>

199
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of multitasking world that</v>

200
00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>folks are growing up in now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are there things people can do,</v>

201
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

202
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to counteract that?</v>

203
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:09:53.971 --> 00:09:55.430
<v Speaker 1>there's concerns about people being</v>
<v Speaker 1>addicted.</v>

205
00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:56.890
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

206
00:09:56.891 --> 00:09:58.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we're all doing that all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

207
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that technology is wonderful and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we just need to be aware of how</v>

208
00:10:04.091 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>much you will call it exerts on us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how difficult that can be to avoid.</v>

209
00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:12.610
<v Speaker 2>So what I would say is we need to learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>to train our attention.</v>

210
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because as with anything,</v>

211
00:10:15.191 --> 00:10:19.510
<v Speaker 2>attention is like a muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an analogy that you hear all over</v>

212
00:10:19.511 --> 00:10:21.490
<v Speaker 2>and over until they college is self</v>
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>

213
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.870
<v Speaker 2>Like a muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

214
00:10:22.871 --> 00:10:24.340
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically you can say,</v>

215
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.990
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a muscle because it's an</v>

216
00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:28.930
<v Speaker 2>analogy that works incredibly well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you train it,</v>

217
00:10:28.931 --> 00:10:30.640
<v Speaker 2>it gets stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets better.</v>

218
00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.840
<v Speaker 2>You are able to know why ticking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have more endurance.</v>

219
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:39.940
<v Speaker 2>And similarly with attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you train yourself to the task</v>

220
00:10:39.941 --> 00:10:43.030
<v Speaker 2>and to only pay attention to one thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a time,</v>

221
00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.960
<v Speaker 2>the longer and longer and longer you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to maintain your focus.</v>

222
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 2>So what's happening when people say that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot pay attention is that they</v>

223
00:10:52.331 --> 00:10:56.860
<v Speaker 2>haven't trained their attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've forgotten what it is to have a</v>

224
00:10:56.861 --> 00:11:00.190
<v Speaker 2>single minded focus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And because they haven't trained it,</v>

225
00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:01.930
<v Speaker 2>their attention actually has gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>

226
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.410
<v Speaker 2>So I think that people know when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>say they cannot pay attention,</v>

227
00:11:05.411 --> 00:11:07.740
<v Speaker 2>they really can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't just happen over night.</v>

228
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what we can do is try to monitor</v>

229
00:11:13.031 --> 00:11:16.570
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and really learn to do one</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing at a time.</v>

230
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.850
<v Speaker 2>For me that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:23.280
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot that I've had to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>to actually maximize my own potential.</v>

232
00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:28.930
<v Speaker 2>When I was writing mastermind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized how Internet addicted I was</v>

233
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.880
<v Speaker 2>and I actually needed to install,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

234
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.390
<v Speaker 2>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an internet blocking software</v>

235
00:11:34.391 --> 00:11:37.390
<v Speaker 2>on my computer so that I wouldn't go</v>
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>

236
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:41.380
<v Speaker 2>And it was really hard for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But eventually I was able to stay off</v>

237
00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:43.540
<v Speaker 2>mine for four or five hours at a time.</v>

238
00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.490
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I turned my phone off because</v>

239
00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:47.600
<v Speaker 2>otherwise it'd be too tempted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

240
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.390
<v Speaker 2>check my internet on the iphone because</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

241
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:55.110
<v Speaker 2>freedom doesn't it get blocked all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your devices and now I don't really need</v>

242
00:11:55.111 --> 00:12:00.111
<v Speaker 2>it as often because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I do it and I've already trained</v>

243
00:12:01.351 --> 00:12:04.860
<v Speaker 2>myself not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still nice once in a while.</v>

244
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:09.270
<v Speaker 2>I think we all need to give ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental breaks and realize that the</v>

245
00:12:09.271 --> 00:12:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Internet is your fault,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes it's good to just focus</v>

246
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.230
<v Speaker 2>and not let those email notifications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those twitter notification.</v>

247
00:12:18.231 --> 00:12:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things that can just sucker</v>

248
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.410
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

249
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.610
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not them interfere.</v>

250
00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And speaking of attention for our</v>

251
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:30.090
<v Speaker 1>viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the noise that sounds like the ocean is</v>

252
00:12:30.091 --> 00:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>a most likely some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:34.980
<v Speaker 1>Maria lives in a fairly noisy</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

254
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Nothing we can really do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what that is.</v>

255
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.751
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

256
00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Let me continue with people's questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I could,</v>

257
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I could do followups here all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

258
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Matthew also asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can you habituate an input from one</v>

259
00:12:50.461 --> 00:12:55.461
<v Speaker 1>sense so that it does not interfere with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attention you give to another sense.</v>

260
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:59.940
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading body language while having a</v>

261
00:12:59.941 --> 00:13:00.990
<v Speaker 1>conversation?</v>

262
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are actually two</v>

263
00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:06.920
<v Speaker 2>different issues here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

264
00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.823
<v Speaker 2>habituation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

265
00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Is it very specific term when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>to psychology and you don't do it,</v>

266
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.520
<v Speaker 2>it just happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's incredibly,</v>

267
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.010
<v Speaker 2>incredibly natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as soon as it,</v>

268
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.380
<v Speaker 2>as there's a stimulus that you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing,</v>

269
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.740
<v Speaker 2>often you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do become habituated to it.</v>

270
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for instance,</v>

271
00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.600
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite examples comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>my personal experience.</v>

272
00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:31.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my freshman year of college,</v>

273
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:36.090
<v Speaker 2>I had a huge church right outside my</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows and the bells would ring and I'm</v>

274
00:13:37.151 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 2>weekends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It bells would ring.</v>

275
00:13:38.321 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And I was a college freshman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to sleep.</v>

276
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and at first they always wake me up and</v>

277
00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I got to the point where I didn't even</v>
<v Speaker 2>hear them.</v>

278
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.850
<v Speaker 2>I didn't realize that was for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

279
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.230
<v Speaker 2>we're ringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not that I made a conscious</v>

280
00:13:50.231 --> 00:13:55.231
<v Speaker 2>effort to habituate your brain learns to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lock out the noises that if serious all</v>

281
00:13:56.681 --> 00:13:59.500
<v Speaker 2>the time and the same can be true of</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision.</v>

282
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.150
<v Speaker 2>So that's why you often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

283
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:02.710
<v Speaker 2>if we tell us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you asked me,</v>

284
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.970
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do I pass on my waist work every</v>

285
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.500
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might not be able to answer think,</v>

286
00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know exactly what I pass,</v>

287
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:13.960
<v Speaker 2>but because I do it every day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't pay attention to it because I've</v>

288
00:14:13.961 --> 00:14:17.780
<v Speaker 2>become habituated to all those sites and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I may not,</v>

289
00:14:17.781 --> 00:14:21.730
<v Speaker 2>it may not even notice that a store has</v>
<v Speaker 2>closed or in the store has opened in its</v>

290
00:14:21.731 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 2>stead unless something draws my</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to it and I'm out of my</v>

291
00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:28.190
<v Speaker 2>situated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

292
00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it just happens.</v>

293
00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:35.320
<v Speaker 2>And what region do is actually not</v>
<v Speaker 2>habituated ourselves and try to is we</v>

294
00:14:35.321 --> 00:14:40.321
<v Speaker 2>don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the active part is not habituation but</v>

295
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.420
<v Speaker 2>with standing habituation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

296
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

297
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

298
00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 1>so one other question from another</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor member,</v>

299
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:52.400
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francoise,</v>

300
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Noel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

301
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:59.320
<v Speaker 1>asks Watson is really helpful to homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have tools or ideas for,</v>

302
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:05.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to create our own imaginary</v>

303
00:15:05.241 --> 00:15:10.241
<v Speaker 1>watson or other ways to get a similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit without having a watson if you</v>

304
00:15:10.971 --> 00:15:11.804
<v Speaker 1>don't have one?</v>

305
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

306
00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting and I'd stopped short</v>
<v Speaker 2>of saying have imaginary people</v>

307
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:21.530
<v Speaker 2>conversations in your heads just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you could take that a little bit</v>

308
00:15:21.531 --> 00:15:25.040
<v Speaker 2>too far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can learn to kind of argue with</v>

309
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.120
<v Speaker 2>yourself and to always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

310
00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:30.650
<v Speaker 2>that's actually how I get a lot of my</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking done.</v>

311
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:32.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

312
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:33.440
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I think,</v>

313
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.151
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

314
00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:37.220
<v Speaker 2>what's the counter argument to that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or why do I think that way?</v>

315
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.450
<v Speaker 2>So force yourself almost to be in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>debate or mindset always.</v>

316
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:45.050
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't just make you more critical</v>
<v Speaker 2>of yourself and make some critical all</v>

317
00:15:45.051 --> 00:15:48.410
<v Speaker 2>of the information that you're taking in</v>
<v Speaker 2>of everything that you're reading is</v>

318
00:15:48.411 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 2>everything that you are watching of all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the constant news and other inputs</v>

319
00:15:53.121 --> 00:15:58.121
<v Speaker 2>that you get every day isn't just don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>take it in as candid as you give him and</v>

320
00:15:58.731 --> 00:15:59.061
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

321
00:15:59.061 --> 00:15:59.960
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

322
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Rather always play devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>

323
00:16:02.871 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't make sense because we're</v>

324
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:05.480
<v Speaker 2>not in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a large way.</v>

325
00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what Watson does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other good thing to do is get</v>

326
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:14.831
<v Speaker 2>yourself a watson and the sense of get</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself someone you know with whom you</v>

327
00:16:14.961 --> 00:16:17.680
<v Speaker 2>can discuss things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who listens to you.</v>

328
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really good to talk things through.</v>

329
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.470
<v Speaker 2>And I think you often find that when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>see gaps in logic,</v>

330
00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.790
<v Speaker 2>when you say something out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be store.</v>

331
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never really voiced.</v>

332
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the ways it can do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

333
00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:34.730
<v Speaker 2>is you think that you know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

334
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Actually pretend that we need to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to someone else and explain it out</v>

335
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:42.680
<v Speaker 2>loud or you can even write it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So writing is,</v>

336
00:16:42.681 --> 00:16:45.770
<v Speaker 2>it was a good exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do what you can say he did.</v>

337
00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:50.720
<v Speaker 2>I really understand this because writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows gaps in logic very,</v>

338
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.900
<v Speaker 2>very strongly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I write something and I'm like,</v>

339
00:16:53.901 --> 00:16:55.460
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that little bit of sense in my head,</v>

340
00:16:55.461 --> 00:16:56.530
<v Speaker 2>but on the page,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's settling.</v>

341
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to try to figure out why that's</v>

342
00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 2>the case and anyone to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

343
00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 2>do you don't need anyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to talk to yourself.</v>

344
00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:09.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to imagine conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all you have to do is write out your</v>

345
00:17:09.651 --> 00:17:13.110
<v Speaker 2>argument as if you were explaining it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else or write out their thinking</v>

346
00:17:13.111 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 2>is a few words to someone else.</v>

347
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.090
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

348
00:17:17.091 --> 00:17:19.730
<v Speaker 1>That's why it can be helpful to keep it</v>
<v Speaker 1>a journal.</v>

349
00:17:19.731 --> 00:17:22.810
<v Speaker 1>I know that I've experienced that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a journal that you,</v>

350
00:17:22.811 --> 00:17:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you start writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know your thoughts about things and</v>

351
00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you're surprised to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

352
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.880
<v Speaker 1>your perspective on them is completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from what you might have</v>

353
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.850
<v Speaker 1>thought it was in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

354
00:17:34.851 --> 00:17:38.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have a couple of questions of my</v>

355
00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:39.250
<v Speaker 1>own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

356
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and maybe in the interest of time I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask just one of them and then see if it</v>

357
00:17:45.951 --> 00:17:47.810
<v Speaker 1>has a follow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

358
00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.280
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll,</v>

359
00:17:49.281 --> 00:17:49.920
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

360
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.790
<v Speaker 1>we'll close out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking over here at another</v>

361
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:56.010
<v Speaker 1>computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm not looking at everyone.</v>

362
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the points you multitasking.</v>

363
00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:00.553
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am.</v>

364
00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.800
<v Speaker 2>It's he media multitasking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

365
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.690
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

366
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 1>many of the points you make in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>workshop add up to the fact that we</v>

367
00:18:07.921 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 1>can't trust our own common sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

368
00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:12.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in your book of course mastermind,</v>

369
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our minds make up stories.</v>

370
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:18.600
<v Speaker 1>They're biased to pay attention to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and ignore others.</v>

371
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:20.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order to solve problems more</v>

372
00:18:20.821 --> 00:18:23.100
<v Speaker 1>effectively,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to examine our assumption</v>

373
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:28.160
<v Speaker 1>assumption's rigorously and consider the</v>
<v Speaker 1>data in ways that don't necessarily come</v>

374
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 1>naturally to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

375
00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.650
<v Speaker 1>which is very counterintuitive in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways to at least,</v>

376
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture I grew up in American</v>

377
00:18:36.691 --> 00:18:38.090
<v Speaker 1>culture of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 1>trust yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

379
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.960
<v Speaker 1>and trust with sort of your common sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a sense.</v>

380
00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only is this practically hard as</v>

381
00:18:47.071 --> 00:18:51.120
<v Speaker 1>we're biased to trust ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might also be emotionally hard in</v>

382
00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:53.840
<v Speaker 1>that many of us construct our identities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sense of self worth,</v>

383
00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

384
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.890
<v Speaker 1>around self trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around trust in our own sort of common</v>

385
00:18:58.891 --> 00:19:02.130
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts about how to</v>

386
00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.980
<v Speaker 1>manage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if somebody is training themselves</v>

387
00:19:04.981 --> 00:19:08.940
<v Speaker 1>to be more skeptical and more critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their own thinking,</v>

388
00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.960
<v Speaker 1>how to manage that transition</v>
<v Speaker 1>emotionally and otherwise?</v>

389
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:18.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>question and I think that the way,</v>

390
00:19:18.811 --> 00:19:22.530
<v Speaker 2>the way that I view it is it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't trust yourself.</v>

391
00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It's don't trust yourself when you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>no reason to do so when you have no</v>

392
00:19:26.761 --> 00:19:30.750
<v Speaker 2>experience in something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So experts can trust all of their</v>

393
00:19:30.751 --> 00:19:34.170
<v Speaker 2>instincts and their common sense in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their areas of expertise.</v>

394
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:39.620
<v Speaker 2>And the problem comes when non-experts</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a book common sense opinion that</v>

395
00:19:40.891 --> 00:19:45.060
<v Speaker 2>really is just coming out of nowhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we do that all the time.</v>

396
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:47.120
<v Speaker 2>There are areas where we're expert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

397
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:51.000
<v Speaker 2>but then we do the exact same thing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>areas where we're not really experts.</v>

398
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.510
<v Speaker 2>So if you think for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see this person and he's acting</v>

399
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:57.000
<v Speaker 2>shifted to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my common sense as he's doing something</v>

400
00:19:57.001 --> 00:19:59.370
<v Speaker 2>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh you shouldn't distress that.</v>

401
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.090
<v Speaker 2>That common sense because you're an</v>
<v Speaker 2>expert in looking at people and in</v>

402
00:20:03.091 --> 00:20:06.120
<v Speaker 2>reading body language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've done that your entire life.</v>

403
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.870
<v Speaker 2>So something as simple as that who</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually aren't an expert in you should</v>

404
00:20:09.871 --> 00:20:13.710
<v Speaker 2>listen to yourself even if you're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really sure why you think something</v>

405
00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>might be picking up on cues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the triggers.</v>

406
00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Ask Yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do I think this person's acting</v>

407
00:20:19.531 --> 00:20:23.250
<v Speaker 2>suspicious?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I actually reading body language or</v>

408
00:20:23.251 --> 00:20:28.251
<v Speaker 2>am I using non expertise?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I putting someone else in my putting</v>

409
00:20:30.061 --> 00:20:33.990
<v Speaker 2>someone else in this situation and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>person just reminds me of someone I</v>

410
00:20:33.991 --> 00:20:36.000
<v Speaker 2>don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now I think they're shifting.</v>

411
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:40.110
<v Speaker 2>So you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not about not trusting yourself per</v>

412
00:20:40.111 --> 00:20:43.050
<v Speaker 2>se.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about examining the reasons for</v>

413
00:20:43.051 --> 00:20:45.510
<v Speaker 2>your assumptions and always saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

414
00:20:45.511 --> 00:20:50.511
<v Speaker 2>am I actually making this judgment based</v>
<v Speaker 2>on some sort of expertise or am I like</v>

415
00:20:50.741 --> 00:20:54.790
<v Speaker 2>one of those people who makes a decision</v>
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not I'm going to hire</v>

416
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:58.340
<v Speaker 2>someone in the first 30 seconds of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview just because I liked them or</v>

417
00:20:58.341 --> 00:20:59.710
<v Speaker 2>didn't like them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

418
00:20:59.711 --> 00:21:02.080
<v Speaker 2>in which case there's no expertise</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

419
00:21:02.081 --> 00:21:04.300
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know anything about the</v>

420
00:21:04.301 --> 00:21:05.300
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

421
00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 2>so I think it depends on the judgment</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it depends on what you're using to</v>

422
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:10.650
<v Speaker 2>get there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that makes sense.</v>

423
00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It makes sense.</v>

424
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

425
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll ask one more question and then</v>

426
00:21:20.331 --> 00:21:21.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we'll turn it over to said,</v>

427
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.730
<v Speaker 1>this is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

428
00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.620
<v Speaker 1>the value of creativity and imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well two psychologists at this point</v>

429
00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.030
<v Speaker 1>understand creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I imagine it's not something,</v>

430
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not a subject that gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

431
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.170
<v Speaker 1>heavy research dollars thrown at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

432
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:46.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their insights yet yielded anything</v>

433
00:21:46.881 --> 00:21:49.070
<v Speaker 1>that you would think of as a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical,</v>

434
00:21:49.071 --> 00:21:53.030
<v Speaker 1>useful approach to teaching or enhancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's creativity,</v>

435
00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:56.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond letting your mind do its thing,</v>

436
00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:57.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daydreaming,</v>

437
00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:58.283
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

438
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think what we're starting to</v>

439
00:22:00.441 --> 00:22:03.050
<v Speaker 2>understand creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's a really,</v>

440
00:22:03.051 --> 00:22:08.051
<v Speaker 2>really hard thing to study because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are many different types of creativity.</v>

441
00:22:08.181 --> 00:22:10.160
<v Speaker 2>There are many manifestations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

442
00:22:10.161 --> 00:22:14.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not like an overarching entity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are or you are not creative.</v>

443
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.530
<v Speaker 2>You're creative in different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are different ways of having</v>

444
00:22:18.531 --> 00:22:20.350
<v Speaker 2>creative insights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

445
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:24.080
<v Speaker 2>so psychologists are a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited in that they have to study</v>

446
00:22:24.081 --> 00:22:27.560
<v Speaker 2>things in a laboratory and so they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have an artificial paradigm.</v>

447
00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.240
<v Speaker 2>And so they try to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

448
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:32.750
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can I proximate creativity.</v>

449
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:34.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why you get a lot of these</v>

450
00:22:34.641 --> 00:22:39.641
<v Speaker 2>studies that look at the Eureka moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Aha moment where you are able to</v>

451
00:22:39.771 --> 00:22:42.020
<v Speaker 2>kind of put things together in a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

452
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:44.510
<v Speaker 2>That's one way that you can study</v>
<v Speaker 2>creativity.</v>

453
00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.540
<v Speaker 2>But it's a V and we're learning a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that.</v>

454
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:50.630
<v Speaker 2>We're aligning how people can become</v>
<v Speaker 2>better at that.</v>

455
00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:52.460
<v Speaker 2>But once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a very,</v>

456
00:22:52.461 --> 00:22:57.170
<v Speaker 2>very specific type of creative thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>and being good at those kinds of Eureka</v>

457
00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.860
<v Speaker 2>problems is not the same thing as being</v>
<v Speaker 2>more creative.</v>

458
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.640
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>overall what we do know,</v>

459
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something that everyone can do is</v>

460
00:23:07.371 --> 00:23:12.371
<v Speaker 2>that for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being in nature helps people become</v>

461
00:23:12.411 --> 00:23:15.890
<v Speaker 2>better at problem solving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So being surrounded by trees,</v>

462
00:23:15.891 --> 00:23:17.160
<v Speaker 2>by water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

463
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:21.230
<v Speaker 2>kind of those types of things for</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever reason,</v>

464
00:23:21.231 --> 00:23:23.750
<v Speaker 2>make people better able to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

465
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.490
<v Speaker 2>to have insights into think of</v>
<v Speaker 2>imaginative solutions.</v>

466
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.640
<v Speaker 2>So it's not just a Eureka moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also,</v>

467
00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll become better eyebrow</v>

468
00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:35.780
<v Speaker 2>brainstorming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The quality of your brainstorm ideas</v>

469
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.860
<v Speaker 2>becomes deeper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

470
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:41.750
<v Speaker 2>and the more that we actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we learned to pay attention,</v>

471
00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:47.050
<v Speaker 2>the more we focus on things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the other part of the puzzle.</v>

472
00:23:47.121 --> 00:23:50.030
<v Speaker 2>There's is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this focus part of creativity.</v>

473
00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:52.350
<v Speaker 2>People always say that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

474
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 2>taking the breaks and those breaks are</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly important,</v>

475
00:23:55.820 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 2>but you have to realize that for homes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for any other creative person,</v>

476
00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:04.160
<v Speaker 2>there's also a lot of hard work that</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes before and you can't distract</v>

477
00:24:04.161 --> 00:24:07.730
<v Speaker 2>yourself while we're doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So homes does have these bouts of</v>

478
00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 2>intense thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>young concentration where he's really</v>

479
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:13.040
<v Speaker 2>mulling over the problem before he takes</v>
<v Speaker 2>his break.</v>

480
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 2>He takes his brake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he already has a lot of that work to</v>

481
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:18.410
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whenever you hear of,</v>

482
00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:21.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people like [inaudible] or anyone else</v>

483
00:24:21.441 --> 00:24:26.441
<v Speaker 2>who is often used as an example of</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough creativity and they spent</v>

484
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.870
<v Speaker 2>weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>

485
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years sometimes mulling over problems.</v>

486
00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.610
<v Speaker 2>And so then the insight comes in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>second.</v>

487
00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.150
<v Speaker 2>But there are different parts to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we can train our</v>

488
00:24:38.151 --> 00:24:41.450
<v Speaker 2>concentration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can take more walks in natural</v>

489
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 2>habitats and those are the things we</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely know can help.</v>

490
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:46.910
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a field that's,</v>

491
00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:49.910
<v Speaker 2>that's getting more and more attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people would really love to know</v>

492
00:24:49.911 --> 00:24:53.470
<v Speaker 2>how to become more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the good news is that you can be,</v>

493
00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.930
<v Speaker 2>you can become more creative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that everyone has the</v>

494
00:24:56.931 --> 00:25:00.410
<v Speaker 2>certain degree of creativity in them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the type of thing,</v>

495
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't say,</v>

496
00:25:01.881 --> 00:25:03.320
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a creative person.</v>

497
00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:06.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't think not creative people exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

498
00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen up all you people who like me,</v>

499
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.660
<v Speaker 1>who think of yourselves as creative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in big cities,</v>

500
00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:18.260
<v Speaker 1>time to get out into the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

501
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.780
<v Speaker 1>and one of the most interesting points I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

502
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria that you make in your book,</v>

503
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:24.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mastermind and,</v>

504
00:25:24.651 --> 00:25:26.750
<v Speaker 1>and in the big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentor workshop,</v>

505
00:25:26.751 --> 00:25:28.860
<v Speaker 1>how to think like Sherlock Holmes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

506
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:34.300
<v Speaker 1>is this fact that this is that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like homes is a creative problem solver.</v>

507
00:25:37.251 --> 00:25:41.930
<v Speaker 1>That he does take information and</v>
<v Speaker 1>recombine it in imaginative ways.</v>

508
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:45.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we tend to associate creativity falsely,</v>

509
00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the arts.</v>

510
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only often and,</v>

511
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and think of science and,</v>

512
00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a detective as somehow more kind</v>

513
00:25:55.311 --> 00:25:56.390
<v Speaker 1>of rational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linear,</v>

514
00:25:56.391 --> 00:25:58.130
<v Speaker 1>analytical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not creative.</v>

515
00:25:58.131 --> 00:26:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important point that you make.</v>

516
00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

517
00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:02.894
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

518
00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.000
<v Speaker 1>with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

519
00:26:05.001 --> 00:26:07.250
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you have any follow up questions</v>

520
00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.350
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to ask before we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

521
00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:11.900
<v Speaker 1>four we wind this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

522
00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:13.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a simple one and maybe it just</v>

523
00:26:13.821 --> 00:26:15.470
<v Speaker 1>got to be good way close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of curious.</v>

524
00:26:15.650 --> 00:26:16.371
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria,</v>

525
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:20.570
<v Speaker 1>did you ever have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what was an Aha moment for you?</v>

526
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading any of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

527
00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.880
<v Speaker 1>home stories.</v>

528
00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.810
<v Speaker 2>What was the Aha moment</v>

529
00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.430
<v Speaker 1>or was there a particular Aha moment for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you reading any of the stories where you</v>

530
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.221
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

531
00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:32.300
<v Speaker 1>we're just kind of hits you and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

532
00:26:32.301 --> 00:26:33.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes perfect sense.</v>

533
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And the way that he was approaching a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>

534
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I definitely had an Aha moment when I</v>

535
00:26:40.681 --> 00:26:44.250
<v Speaker 2>realized that I wanted to write about</v>
<v Speaker 2>homes and started really reading all the</v>

536
00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:48.900
<v Speaker 2>stories and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was more of a reading all of them in</v>

537
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:51.780
<v Speaker 2>very close succession very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very closely,</v>

538
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:53.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>underlining,</v>

539
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.310
<v Speaker 2>highlighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing notes in the margins,</v>

540
00:26:56.311 --> 00:26:58.720
<v Speaker 2>kind of doing this very close reading.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

541
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 2>and my Aha moment was that Sherlock</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holmes really is a different type of</v>

542
00:27:02.641 --> 00:27:04.980
<v Speaker 2>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thinker that I remembered from</v>

543
00:27:04.981 --> 00:27:08.160
<v Speaker 2>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that he's often portrayed as</v>

544
00:27:08.161 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's so imaginative and creative</v>

545
00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.290
<v Speaker 2>and warm and if not a cold machine at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

546
00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:19.680
<v Speaker 2>And it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it was one of those,</v>

547
00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do people always think of him as</v>

548
00:27:22.411 --> 00:27:25.000
<v Speaker 2>this logical Automaton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

549
00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:28.200
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a computer when he's anything,</v>

550
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:29.820
<v Speaker 2>but when all of the things that may</v>
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>

551
00:27:29.821 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 2>Sherlock Holmes are things that a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer can't accomplish.</v>

552
00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:39.090
<v Speaker 2>And that to me was exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

553
00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.770
<v Speaker 2>It was really eye opening because even</v>
<v Speaker 2>from my childhood,</v>

554
00:27:43.771 --> 00:27:47.070
<v Speaker 2>from reading the stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't remember that I instead had</v>

555
00:27:47.071 --> 00:27:50.350
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stereotype of peace,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this computer,</v>

556
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:54.030
<v Speaker 2>just this perfectly logical person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's anything about it.</v>

557
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

558
00:27:57.171 --> 00:27:57.951
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
