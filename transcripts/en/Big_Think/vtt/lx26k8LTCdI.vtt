1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.450
<v Speaker 1>In my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideal,</v>

2
00:00:03.451 --> 00:00:08.451
<v Speaker 1>right away with a meeting of meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I knew I would be attacked like</v>

3
00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:13.971
<v Speaker 1>a disturbed nest of Hornets by</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers if I did not.</v>

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>And of course meeting has a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>meanings,</v>

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>but generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you've gone past the basic</v>

6
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>religious definition of meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

7
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the divine creator,</v>

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is responsible for the design,</v>

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>then a nature of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what else do you want to know?</v>

10
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after you get past that particular</v>

11
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.980
<v Speaker 1>response?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>then the subject moved to meaning as</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

13
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.490
<v Speaker 1>That is essentially what are we and why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do we come from?</v>

14
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 1>And this is part of meetings who were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we was most likely to be headed.</v>

15
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.050
<v Speaker 1>And I like to suggest that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer those questions,</v>

16
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 1>we cannot do it with religion because</v>
<v Speaker 1>every religion has or ever religious</v>

17
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>faith rather has a different creation</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

18
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Story of how the universe and earth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people came into being.</v>

19
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And every faith has its own special</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts of supernatural events and they</v>

20
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:42.271
<v Speaker 1>differ one from the other and they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in competition.</v>

21
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 1>And in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

22
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be boiled down to any kind of a</v>

23
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>coherent explanation because religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>face is very much a product of human</v>

24
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 1>culture and we can't really figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>just what we are,</v>

25
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:06.081
<v Speaker 1>what our meaning is by introspection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm reminded of the statements of Darwin</v>

26
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>made in one of his notebooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a,</v>

27
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:17.631
<v Speaker 1>that the mind consciousness cannot be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>taken by direct assault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We cannot imagine what we are inside my</v>

29
00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>thinking about it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't,</v>

31
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been really dented very well</v>
<v Speaker 1>by philosophy.</v>

32
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I like to see that most of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy which is a declining and</v>

33
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:52.221
<v Speaker 1>highly endangered academic species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a incidentally a consist of failed</v>

34
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>models of how the brain works.</v>

35
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So students going into philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter half to learn what they cart</v>

36
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>thought and then after a long while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while that's wrong,</v>

37
00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:11.251
<v Speaker 1>and what a schopenhauer might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and what might've thought or did</v>

38
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>sink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they cannot go on from that position</v>

39
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:21.721
<v Speaker 1>in historical examination of the nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity to what it really is and how</v>

40
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>we might define it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by default,</v>

41
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.220
<v Speaker 1>the explanation of meaning of humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>falls to science and we are making</v>

42
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 1>progress if I might speak for science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 1>and it's from five disciplines and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will take just a moment to tell you what</v>

44
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:52.591
<v Speaker 1>they are and then it'll make sense as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not all of sciences whole by any</v>

45
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:59.090
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is developing exponentially and in</v>

46
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the creation of knowledge faster and</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster,</v>

47
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from a particular set of disciplines</v>

48
00:04:06.761 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>within science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to name them as I</v>

49
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>approached that.</v>

50
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>And I'll say you cannot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot get the answer from</v>

51
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.270
<v Speaker 1>astrophysics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are astrophysicists.</v>

52
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:21.690
<v Speaker 1>Glad to try to explain to you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetorically in some way or other that</v>

53
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>what's the meaning of humanity is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what their studies of astrophysics tells</v>

54
00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:31.720
<v Speaker 1>us about the significance of humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget it.</v>

55
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>They can't possibly tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor just astronomers,</v>

56
00:04:35.651 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>nor just chemists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor just,</v>

57
00:04:38.981 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>my own colleagues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular biologists,</v>

59
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>they're too far removed from the subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make any sensible thing about the</v>

60
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:51.541
<v Speaker 1>meaning of human existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>what are the disciplines?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at these disciplines as</v>

62
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've actually worked as a</v>

63
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.380
<v Speaker 1>researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a in a couple,</v>

64
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>you have to know what the contributions</v>
<v Speaker 1>are of evolutionary biology that is</v>

65
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:14.731
<v Speaker 1>biology scene in a historical context</v>
<v Speaker 1>going all the way back,</v>

66
00:05:16.241 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>millions of years to the origin of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human species.</v>

67
00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>another one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

69
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>another science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

70
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:29.851
<v Speaker 1>it's paleontology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which segues as we come closer to a</v>

71
00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>modern humanity and the invention of</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and the birth of the</v>

72
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>Neolithic period turns into archaeology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>archaeology,</v>

73
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>and paleontology which are on different</v>
<v Speaker 1>timescales,</v>

74
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>is the other discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another second discipline,</v>

75
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.450
<v Speaker 1>and a third of course.</v>

76
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 1>And everybody would know about this now</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's progressing so rapidly in</v>

77
00:05:53.171 --> 00:05:58.171
<v Speaker 1>so many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bringing science and then coming out</v>

78
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>of brain science or running parallel to</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and trading with it.</v>

79
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>And depending upon it and deriving from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

80
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we turned down to a more technology</v>

81
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>savvy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is a artificial intelligence.</v>

82
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>And with a artificial intelligence is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fifth robotics.</v>

83
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Robotics is so important as Hollywood is</v>
<v Speaker 1>now glommed onto knowing a good story</v>

84
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:35.651
<v Speaker 1>when they see one robotics included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the notion of studying the</v>

85
00:06:35.961 --> 00:06:40.961
<v Speaker 1>mind in perfecting artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and more than that,</v>

86
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>creating what the artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and robotics people call</v>

87
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>whole brain emulation that is using</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots as avatars and creating robots</v>

88
00:06:56.571 --> 00:07:01.100
<v Speaker 1>that are designed by design and</v>
<v Speaker 1>imitation of what we know about the</v>

89
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:06.101
<v Speaker 1>brain more and more like humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those five disciplines to get</v>

90
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making bridges here and there are</v>

91
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:16.511
<v Speaker 1>beginning to tell us what's the meaning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humanity is a product of a grand epic</v>

92
00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:24.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's a full story of humanity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just beginning to just draw it in</v>

93
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 1>clarity and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me just add to that why I'm leaving</v>

94
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

95
00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>History of the whole human species</v>
<v Speaker 1>should kinetic as well as cultural.</v>

96
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have no chance whatsoever in</v>

97
00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:50.590
<v Speaker 1>defining the meaning of human existence</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

98
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.820
<v Speaker 1>history that goes back essentially to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the origin of literacy history makes no</v>

99
00:08:00.561 --> 00:08:03.340
<v Speaker 1>sense without prehistory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say,</v>

100
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biological evolution says lead up to</v>

101
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:12.941
<v Speaker 1>the human condition as the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>history and prehistory in turn is a</v>

102
00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:20.151
<v Speaker 1>study of our ancestors going right back</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the animal kingdom,</v>

103
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>makes no sense without biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to have a constant building,</v>

104
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:30.860
<v Speaker 1>a concatenation of ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

105
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 1>discipline to discipline across scales</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the totality of the human population</v>

106
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.740
<v Speaker 1>and scales of time going back actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years to our early prehuman</v>

107
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.440
<v Speaker 1>ancestors and then forward to the era of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural evolution.</v>

108
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:56.950
<v Speaker 1>And then we will have the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity and then we will not ask in a</v>

109
00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:01.040
<v Speaker 1>quizzical manner what is the meaning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>

110
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.100
<v Speaker 1>What is the meaning of human existence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will have our answers.</v>
