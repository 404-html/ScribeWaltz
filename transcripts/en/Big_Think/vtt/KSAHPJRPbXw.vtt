1
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of indications that there</v>

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>still racism in American society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at overall indicators for</v>

3
00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>life chances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a life expectancy in comm wealth,</v>

4
00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>educational attainment and performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>within schools,</v>

5
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 1>we still see discernible differences in</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance between whites and Asians</v>

6
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>and blacks and Latinos in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those differences are attributed</v>

8
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>to systemic or structural factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to the extent that we can explain</v>

9
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>those differences by systemic</v>
<v Speaker 1>instructional factors and we can,</v>

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>that is evidence of racism in American</v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while we don't see a lot of the racial</v>

12
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.710
<v Speaker 1>violence that we saw a century ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still see examples of overt racial</v>

13
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>violence in the United States today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

14
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the southern poverty law center has just</v>

15
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>released a report that indicates that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a lot of racial violence in the</v>

16
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>south directed towards Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>under the guise of xenophobia and anti</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration stances.</v>

18
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>And so when we see these things</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>

19
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:03.660
<v Speaker 1>when we see news incidences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.440
<v Speaker 1>on the rise in 2007 towards African</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

21
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 1>we can still say that there still</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigotry,</v>

22
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.880
<v Speaker 1>racism and prejudice and American</v>
<v Speaker 1>society</v>

23
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.610
<v Speaker 1>well indicates tremendous progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It demonstrates the power and influence</v>

24
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>of the African American vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a remarkable that African</v>

25
00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Americans have been able to exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

26
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.470
<v Speaker 1>a political influence in such a way 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>years after the passage of the voting</v>

27
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:32.140
<v Speaker 1>rights act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now 44 years after the passage of the</v>

28
00:01:32.141 --> 00:01:33.580
<v Speaker 1>voting rights act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:33.581 --> 00:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>it is a testament to the increasing</v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance of nonblack communities and</v>

30
00:01:37.241 --> 00:01:40.600
<v Speaker 1>putting their faith in confidence in</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Barack Obama to be their</v>

31
00:01:40.601 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at other candidacies for the</v>

32
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:45.160
<v Speaker 1>presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

33
00:01:45.161 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Jesse Jackson's a Democratic candidate</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees in 1984,</v>

34
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:52.780
<v Speaker 1>1988 people were not prepared to elect</v>
<v Speaker 1>an African American president at that</v>

35
00:01:52.781 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that Obama was able to make</v>

36
00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>it past the nomination stage and to win</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidency shows tremendous racial</v>

37
00:01:59.231 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>progress in this country.</v>

38
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>A post racial society should we ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

39
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>there would be a society where when</v>
<v Speaker 1>social scientists like me run our models</v>

40
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>and we include a race as a dummy</v>
<v Speaker 1>variable races no longer hours,</v>

41
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 1>typically significant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.490
<v Speaker 1>and we're just not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anytime we run a model,</v>

43
00:02:18.491 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>we see significant differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.140
<v Speaker 1>in that some of the indicators that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned before,</v>

45
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:26.770
<v Speaker 1>education and calm life expectancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a probability of going to jail,</v>

46
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>other types of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once those things are no longer</v>

47
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 1>being predicted by race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can say that we're in a post</v>

48
00:02:34.631 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>racial society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But until then,</v>

49
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's race stills actually very</v>

50
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:41.440
<v Speaker 1>significant in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as an aside for the president,</v>

51
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people argue that his race wasn't a</v>

52
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>hindrance to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

53
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:46.580
<v Speaker 1>it may have been a help to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>racism and racial stereotyping cut both</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

55
00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can cut in negative ways and it can</v>

56
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>cut in positive ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in many ways,</v>

57
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>President Obama represented the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exception that proved the rule.</v>

58
00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>That's still the notion of race in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and it's still reifies negative</v>

59
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes towards African Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while it makes us feel good,</v>

60
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may make us feel progressive or</v>

61
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>liberal or cosmopolitan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still some underlying racial</v>

62
00:03:11.801 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>prejudice that goes into the attitude</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we need to be very mindful of that.</v>

63
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I think as post racialism is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructed in popular media today,</v>

64
00:03:23.461 --> 00:03:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it does actually have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.850
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.460
<v Speaker 1>potential to water down diversity and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:33.360
<v Speaker 1>helps to obscure the need to appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's diversity.</v>

68
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes people will be indeed the</v>

69
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:40.311
<v Speaker 1>term post racialism during the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>election as a shortcut to be able to not</v>

70
00:03:40.351 --> 00:03:43.980
<v Speaker 1>deal with a persistent racism in</v>
<v Speaker 1>American society.</v>

71
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I actually wrote about this in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post and got attacked for it.</v>

72
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

73
00:03:49.051 --> 00:03:50.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people could say,</v>

74
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>I voted for Barack Obama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore I am not prejudiced.</v>

75
00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>I voted for Barack Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore there's no racism in American</v>

76
00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 1>society anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:03:58.111 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 1>one historic election while important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:06.171
<v Speaker 1>and while pivotal is not necessarily a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign that we have completely turned the</v>

79
00:04:06.211 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 1>corner and we always have to be vigilant</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

80
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own prejudices,</v>

81
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 1>our own attitudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this goes for minorities and non</v>

82
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:15.810
<v Speaker 1>minorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a light to be able to be on our guard to</v>

83
00:04:15.811 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 1>recognize that we're all capable of</v>
<v Speaker 1>slipping back into old patterns of</v>

84
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:23.160
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we declare 2009 the post racial age</v>

85
00:04:23.161 --> 00:04:27.180
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we end up sort of failing to recognize</v>

86
00:04:27.181 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Speaker 1>that we are all still human and that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all still very susceptible to</v>

87
00:04:30.751 --> 00:04:33.450
<v Speaker 1>allowed really bad attitudes towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>other groups.</v>

88
00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Black leadership today looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have been dubbed post racial</v>

89
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:44.400
<v Speaker 1>leaders in American society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like President Obama,</v>

90
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>people like governor deval Patrick or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mayor Cory Booker,</v>

91
00:04:47.611 --> 00:04:51.960
<v Speaker 1>Adrian fenty or congressmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archer Davis or Harold Ford owe a debt</v>

92
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>of gratitude to the African American</v>
<v Speaker 1>forebearers who came before them,</v>

93
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.430
<v Speaker 1>who were not always welcome in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream political circles,</v>

94
00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>who are perceived as being racialized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are often defined in direct</v>

95
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:07.050
<v Speaker 1>opposition to this young Khadra of</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

96
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.240
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most of them do recognize that they</v>

97
00:05:09.241 --> 00:05:12.510
<v Speaker 1>owe a debt of gratitude to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trailblazing steps that,</v>

98
00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:13.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>

99
00:05:13.471 --> 00:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forefathers and foremothers made for</v>

100
00:05:15.661 --> 00:05:16.830
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

101
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.210
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the current electoral system</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which many young black politicians</v>

102
00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:22.590
<v Speaker 1>are running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

103
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really seek out alliances with Latinos</v>

104
00:05:25.741 --> 00:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>in their communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we know in this past election</v>

105
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.520
<v Speaker 1>that one of the things that Health</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama and his quest for the</v>

106
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:36.390
<v Speaker 1>presidency was increased a democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting amongst Latinos.</v>

107
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.550
<v Speaker 1>And so for the previous two election</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycles,</v>

108
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>we had seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

110
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.920
<v Speaker 1>identifying increasingly with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party in terms of their vote.</v>

111
00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 1>We saw that tide switch and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going back to more normal</v>

112
00:05:47.491 --> 00:05:50.790
<v Speaker 1>historic levels of voting behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most Latinos,</v>

113
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of cities where there</v>

114
00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>are blacks and Latinos who live side by</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and where both groups make up a</v>

115
00:05:56.521 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>significant portion of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you do need a Latino support in</v>

116
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>order to create a multiracial coalition</v>
<v Speaker 1>that puts blacks and office.</v>

117
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>So to that extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

118
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some cities where a,</v>

119
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>you don't see blacks and Latinos living</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the same space or in the same</v>

120
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>political jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those alliances are less salient</v>

121
00:06:14.541 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those uh,</v>

122
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

123
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:21.320
<v Speaker 1>in most races you do need abroad and</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiracial coalition and that certainly</v>

124
00:06:21.321 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>includes Latinos.</v>

125
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I studied African American leadership</v>
<v Speaker 1>and particularly interested in questions</v>

126
00:06:30.731 --> 00:06:33.250
<v Speaker 1>of generational transition amongst</v>
<v Speaker 1>African Americans.</v>

127
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.270
<v Speaker 1>So I'm interested in black politicians</v>
<v Speaker 1>born after 1960.</v>

128
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:40.900
<v Speaker 1>What are the implications for having</v>
<v Speaker 1>been born after the civil rights</v>

129
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having been the beneficiary of the civil</v>

130
00:06:42.971 --> 00:06:46.270
<v Speaker 1>rights movement in terms of being able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to run for political office,</v>

131
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being able to change the landscape</v>

132
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:52.720
<v Speaker 1>of what we usually consider an African</v>
<v Speaker 1>American political agenda.</v>

133
00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this has led to me editing one book</v>

134
00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:59.260
<v Speaker 1>coming out later this year called who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>black politics cases in post racial</v>

135
00:06:59.261 --> 00:07:01.960
<v Speaker 1>black leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I just received a contract for my</v>

136
00:07:01.961 --> 00:07:04.540
<v Speaker 1>book that focuses on Newark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey called Newark and the clash</v>

137
00:07:04.541 --> 00:07:06.470
<v Speaker 1>of two Black Americas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>with respect or relating to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

139
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I am interested in the intersection of</v>
<v Speaker 1>race and class in particular.</v>

140
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.140
<v Speaker 1>And looking at class based politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So usually we think about African</v>

141
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>American politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

142
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 1>in terms of a deep political unity.</v>

143
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So we look at the fact that 90% of</v>
<v Speaker 1>African Americans usually vote</v>

144
00:07:24.881 --> 00:07:28.390
<v Speaker 1>democratic and presidential elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was 95% in 2008.</v>

145
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And we look at partisan identification</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the African American community being</v>

146
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:36.290
<v Speaker 1>about 80% democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so people assume that blacks were</v>

147
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.130
<v Speaker 1>monolithic political group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've always known that that wasn't</v>

148
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:41.740
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're generally forces such as</v>

149
00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>discrimination and racism that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>compelled African Americans to close</v>

150
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 1>ranks politically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my questions tend to ask,</v>

151
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:51.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens within this democratic</v>

152
00:07:51.011 --> 00:07:53.920
<v Speaker 1>coalition when you have African</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans who represent different</v>

153
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:56.650
<v Speaker 1>political agendas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who represent different political areas</v>

154
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>and who are very explicitly represent</v>
<v Speaker 1>different types of class politics.</v>

155
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.320
<v Speaker 1>What's the impact on what we think of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>that classic African American Political</v>

156
00:08:05.321 --> 00:08:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Agenda?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we're talking about reducing</v>

157
00:08:07.241 --> 00:08:09.370
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>addressing poverty,</v>

158
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>how to address poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in what ways to frame that.</v>

159
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.250
<v Speaker 1>And so there's definitely a generational</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle within African American</v>

160
00:08:15.251 --> 00:08:16.630
<v Speaker 1>communities over these issues.</v>

161
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>And there's been this long standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

162
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.460
<v Speaker 1>discussion about the efficacy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>adopting what we would call d racialized</v>

163
00:08:24.461 --> 00:08:27.520
<v Speaker 1>politics and political science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what I think most journalists are</v>

164
00:08:27.521 --> 00:08:31.000
<v Speaker 1>calling post racial politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the politics of racial transcendence,</v>

165
00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.780
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily making explicit racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>appeals to African American communities.</v>

166
00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.010
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of people who are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned that when candidates do not</v>

167
00:08:39.011 --> 00:08:42.070
<v Speaker 1>talk about race on the campaign trail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they are hamstrung from being able</v>

168
00:08:42.071 --> 00:08:45.700
<v Speaker 1>to address race any very forceful and</v>
<v Speaker 1>explicit way once they're in office.</v>

169
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Now that we have a critical mass of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote post racial young black</v>

170
00:08:52.421 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>political leaders who have used these</v>
<v Speaker 1>deviation racial strategies to in top is</v>

171
00:08:55.591 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>we now are going to be in a position to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to test a whether or not they</v>

172
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>are effective in their office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they are more effective than</v>

173
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:05.110
<v Speaker 1>there are black predecessors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

174
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>and whether or not we can actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>advance that classic African American</v>

175
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>political agenda going forward.</v>
