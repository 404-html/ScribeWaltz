1
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.820
<v Speaker 1>When do you start talking about hope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people think it's immediately a</v>

2
00:00:05.821 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>kind of Pollyanna ish thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be hopeful,</v>

4
00:00:08.761 --> 00:00:11.500
<v Speaker 1>or it's kind of a greeting card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go kind of doe wide and start</v>

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:19.170
<v Speaker 1>thinking soft thoughts about how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>should all be hopeful in one another.</v>

7
00:00:19.171 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>And of course there are some important</v>
<v Speaker 1>things to be said in favor of those</v>

8
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we think of hope as also an</v>

9
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:29.211
<v Speaker 1>extremely difficult and important and</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundational sort of state that can be</v>

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>discussed in ways that aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So saccharin.</v>

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers talk about with respect to</v>

12
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:44.451
<v Speaker 1>hope is of course it's rationality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a sense in which you can't</v>

13
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>hope for everything you can wish for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of things for which you can't hope.</v>

14
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:53.781
<v Speaker 1>I can wish that the bears won the</v>
<v Speaker 1>superbowl last year.</v>

15
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't hope that they won the</v>

16
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>superbowl last year because we know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't.</v>

17
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And so it seems almost like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>misusing the word to say,</v>

18
00:01:02.551 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>I hope that they won last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I hope that the weather was different</v>

19
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>yesterday than it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of semantic content</v>

20
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>that suggests that there are rationality</v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints on hope,</v>

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.950
<v Speaker 1>which philosophers tried to look at an</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyze.</v>

22
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>There's a kind of orthodox account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People call it the Orthodox account</v>

23
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 1>because most people share it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.710
<v Speaker 1>that says that hope involves at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>desiring something and believing that</v>

25
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in this case,</v>

26
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't believe that the weather</v>
<v Speaker 1>yesterday could be different than it</v>

27
00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you wouldn't believe that's</v>

28
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.230
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you can't really hope for it.</v>

29
00:01:37.231 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>So that's that condition that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>constraining the rationality of hope.</v>

30
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>And then there's this kind of debate</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what further conditions might be</v>

31
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:45.294
<v Speaker 1>required.</v>

32
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>One thought experiment that people have</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed frequently is that of the</v>

33
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:54.210
<v Speaker 1>Shawshank redemption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is a Stephen King short story</v>

34
00:01:54.211 --> 00:01:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that was turned into a film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have two characters and,</v>

35
00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>and read both of them really desire</v>
<v Speaker 1>something to get out of prison.</v>

36
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Both of them regarded as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's explicit in the story and in the</v>

37
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow one character,</v>

38
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:14.031
<v Speaker 1>andy is hopeful and says he's hopeful</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that he's acting in such a way as to</v>

39
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:17.310
<v Speaker 1>make it come about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if he thinks it's extremely</v>

40
00:02:17.311 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other character red says he</v>

41
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>can't allow himself to hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fear of disappointment is too great</v>

42
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>and will crush him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they both meet those conditions.</v>

43
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:31.710
<v Speaker 1>It's something they really desire and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something they believe to be</v>

44
00:02:31.711 --> 00:02:33.750
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yet one hopes and the other</v>

45
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>despairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cases like this make people think,</v>

46
00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:39.270
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need some other kind of condition to</v>

47
00:02:39.271 --> 00:02:41.940
<v Speaker 1>really explain the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope and despair.</v>

48
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>And that's where some of the debate is</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the moment,</v>

49
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>trying to find this elusive third</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

50
00:02:48.121 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>And different people have different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things they want to add to the Orthodox</v>

51
00:02:51.031 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>conception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My own favored approach,</v>

52
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:59.481
<v Speaker 1>which I'm in the middle of writing up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what I call the focus or attention</v>

53
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>account of hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54
00:03:01.631 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>so it basically says something like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between hope and despair is</v>

55
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:10.621
<v Speaker 1>the extent to which you're focusing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very slim odds of the thing coming</v>

56
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>about or whether you're focusing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it's possible or that you take</v>

57
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>it to be possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're focused on the thing as a</v>

58
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>possibility under the aspect of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility,</v>

59
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're hoping for it.</v>

60
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>If you're focusing on the fact that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly unlikely and the odds are so</v>

61
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>such long shot odds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're despairing of it.</v>

62
00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.230
<v Speaker 1>So you can desire it in the same way you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can believe that it's possible in the</v>

63
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's this focus that really makes</v>

64
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the difference between hope and despair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might even be a kind of spectrum</v>

65
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.520
<v Speaker 1>thing where you can move back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The focus might be under your control</v>

66
00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>sometimes other times given the</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances or the the strength of the</v>

67
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>desire that might not always be under</v>
<v Speaker 1>your control.</v>

68
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>So I also kind of talk a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the way a certain kind of,</v>

69
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfulness training can lead us to be</v>

70
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:05.191
<v Speaker 1>more hopeful people cultivating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue of hope by learning how to focus</v>

71
00:04:05.351 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>on something under the aspect of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility rather than allowing our</v>

72
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>focus or attention to always drift</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the fact that it's so unlikely.</v>

73
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can even hear this in the way that</v>

74
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>someone might say something about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hope for or despair of.</v>

75
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>So in the Andy and red case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy might say,</v>

76
00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>I know that it's really unlikely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's possible and sort of</v>

77
00:04:31.001 --> 00:04:34.540
<v Speaker 1>focus on the possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the hopeful sort of approach.</v>

78
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 1>And Red might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that it's possible,</v>

79
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's really unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Same desire,</v>

80
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>same estimation of the probabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can even hear in the way it's</v>

81
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>stated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of difference in attitude that I</v>

82
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>take to be the essential difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between hope and despair.</v>

83
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>So one more locus of discussion is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between hope,</v>

84
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.020
<v Speaker 1>optimism and action.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people regard hope in a</v>

85
00:05:02.021 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>way as unserious because it gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>detached from action in a certain way.</v>

86
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>So hope is something that you do when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do anything else.</v>

87
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.130
<v Speaker 1>It's the kind of curse that is left in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pandora's box because you still have it,</v>

88
00:05:15.131 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>even though there's nothing else you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with respect to achieving the goal</v>

89
00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 1>and question.</v>

90
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm just hoping for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems possible,</v>

91
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's not much I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just sort of passively hoping.</v>

92
00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obviously seems like a bit of a</v>

93
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>character of the way in which hope might</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually work.</v>

94
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>And so we're curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people in both psychology,</v>

95
00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or other social sciences as well as</v>

96
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>philosophers and religious studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in our project think about the</v>

97
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:45.901
<v Speaker 1>way in which hope underwrites action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope manifested itself in action.</v>

98
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Hope is the result of actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So agency and hope is a really</v>

99
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>interesting set of issues that we think</v>
<v Speaker 1>is underdeveloped.</v>
