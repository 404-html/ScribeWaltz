1
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

2
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I read a whole book on</v>

3
00:00:11.271 --> 00:00:12.104
<v Speaker 2>checklists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'd be,</v>

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.500
<v Speaker 2>why in the world would anybody write a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole book on checklists?</v>

5
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.660
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was the last thing I thought I</v>

6
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 2>would be writing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've been fascinated by how we</v>

7
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 2>grapple with risk and complexity in</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 2>And I got assigned a project to try to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find a way to reduce deaths in surgery.</v>

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

10
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 2>had been struggling with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

11
00:00:34.281 --> 00:00:39.281
<v Speaker 2>And so I started looking at how people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other fields grapple with the</v>

12
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 2>enormously increasing complexity that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in professional worlds are</v>

13
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 2>dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I found was in the aviation and</v>

14
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.090
<v Speaker 2>skyscraper building and other lines of</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

15
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 2>that there was something really</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamental going on.</v>

16
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.930
<v Speaker 2>We had transformed from a world where</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignorance was our biggest struggle as</v>

17
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 2>human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way it was for millennia.</v>

18
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 2>We didn't understand why the human body</v>
<v Speaker 2>fails,</v>

19
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to build things really well,</v>

20
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 2>how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to do many,</v>

21
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:13.121
<v Speaker 2>many kinds of tasks in the right way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that knowledge was missing today.</v>

22
00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.010
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our biggest struggle is with what people</v>

23
00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 2>call an aptitude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meaning the knowledge is there,</v>

24
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 2>but somebody is not doing it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

25
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 2>and in surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other parts of medicine,</v>

26
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 2>what we're finding is that the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

27
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 2>the volume,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complexity,</v>

28
00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 2>the tons of papers coming across the</v>
<v Speaker 2>transom,</v>

29
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 2>the technologies that are proliferating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all of it has exceeded our</v>

30
00:01:43.461 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 2>abilities as individuals to hold it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our head and do it right.</v>

31
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 2>And there are lots of fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out where this has been</v>

32
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 2>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

33
00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>constructing buildings well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 2>in making good investment decisions by</v>
<v Speaker 2>hedge funds.</v>

35
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when I looked to see how people who</v>

36
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 2>actually are solving these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're solving it,</v>

37
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I thought you'd find that they had just</v>
<v Speaker 2>trained in a different way or they had,</v>

38
00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 2>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were training longer and harder.</v>

39
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 2>They had a different kind of use of</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

40
00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I found over and over again was</v>

41
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:26.381
<v Speaker 2>they use checklists as simple and</v>
<v Speaker 2>mundane as it sounds that the checklist</v>

42
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.650
<v Speaker 2>in a way filled in for weaknesses in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's brains,</v>

43
00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:32.870
<v Speaker 2>things that they forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

44
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>it also filled in for weaknesses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>making teams work.</v>

45
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>Teams constantly drop stuff between the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cracks.</v>

46
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:42.470
<v Speaker 2>And so we made a checklist based on what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned.</v>

47
00:02:42.471 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 2>Actually I got folks from Boeing to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>us out.</v>

48
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>How do you make a checklist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think that that would be all</v>

49
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 2>that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turned out to be hard and I'm,</v>

50
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they showed us was how</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

51
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 2>how to really focus on making it swift</v>
<v Speaker 2>and usable.</v>

52
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>We made a two minute surgery checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had just 19 items.</v>

53
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Some of them were just make sure you</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget dumb stuff.</v>

54
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Make sure you gave antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure you um,</v>

55
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 2>have blood ready for a high blood loss</v>
<v Speaker 2>case.</v>

56
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>And then there were other interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>parts.</v>

57
00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure everybody in the room has been</v>

58
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:18.480
<v Speaker 2>introduced by name and role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make sure the surgeon actually explained</v>

59
00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>to the team what their goals for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>operation are.</v>

60
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 2>Make sure the anesthesiologist and nurse</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a chance to explain their plans for</v>

61
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:27.630
<v Speaker 2>the operation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

62
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 2>I put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 2>we put that checklist in eight hospitals</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world ranging from rural</v>

64
00:03:33.461 --> 00:03:38.461
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania to Toronto and Seattle and</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single hospital,</v>

65
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>we put it in and had a double digit</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduction in complications.</v>

66
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 2>The average reduction in death was 46%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

67
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.820
<v Speaker 2>that made me realize there was something</v>
<v Speaker 2>much deeper and more important going on</v>

68
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 2>here about this set of problems were</v>
<v Speaker 2>grappling with.</v>

69
00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:59.581
<v Speaker 2>And in the modern world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well on the one hand you'd say 0%.</v>

70
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at,</v>

71
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>we have about 13,000 diagnoses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've recognized the human body to have</v>

72
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:13.203
<v Speaker 2>four.</v>

73
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 2>We have 6,000 drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>4,000 different kinds of medical and</v>

74
00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.570
<v Speaker 2>surgical procedures and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

75
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 2>and we know for each of them there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from half a dozen to many dozen</v>

76
00:04:24.251 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>steps that we should make sure are done</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly.</v>

77
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we just rely on human memory.</v>

78
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 2>The person in the office that you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>to just remember what that stuff is and</v>

79
00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>we drop stuff all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A friend of mine went in for a</v>

80
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 2>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

81
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 2>she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was just becoming really low.</v>

82
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the doctor put her on an antidepressant</v>

83
00:04:45.191 --> 00:04:47.200
<v Speaker 2>and for next three years they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>changing antidepressants,</v>

84
00:04:47.201 --> 00:04:49.780
<v Speaker 2>trying to get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was only much later,</v>

85
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 2>it's three years that they realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

86
00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 2>we didn't check your thyroid hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>

87
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 2>And she just had low thyroid hormone</v>
<v Speaker 2>levels,</v>

88
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 2>two weeks of thyroid hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she was better.</v>

89
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:04.231
<v Speaker 2>She lost three years because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the surgery checklist is in place in</v>

90
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>about 20% of American hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some countries have implemented it</v>

91
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 2>nationwide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

92
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.400
<v Speaker 2>the United Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

93
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.060
<v Speaker 2>places like Ecuador are adopting it</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationwide.</v>

94
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.740
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

95
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are people really using it in their</v>

96
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 2>heart of hearts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they in there?</v>

97
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the surgery world we are adopting it.</v>

98
00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but have we recognize the lesson that</v>

99
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is the way we ought to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about that we ought to have literally</v>

100
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 2>pick up a checklist when you come in</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a new problem,</v>

101
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're not there with.</v>

102
00:05:40.001 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Every time we get on an airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone picks up a checklist.</v>

103
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>

104
00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a cultural obstacle.</v>

105
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.590
<v Speaker 2>We see checklists as a weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as individual practitioners.</v>

106
00:05:53.591 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 2>if you were in seeing a surgeon and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

108
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I better check a textbook on this or I</v>

109
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>want to check my checklist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

111
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 2>we're not there yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Culturally we're starting to be,</v>

112
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 2>the second obstacle is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

113
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 2>any old checklist is not the story here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we could end up just creating a</v>

114
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>bunch of paperwork and tick boxes that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just get ignored and aren't really</v>

115
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:22.391
<v Speaker 2>valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the institutional obstacle is we have</v>

116
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 2>to recognize this as a science in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aviation world.</v>

117
00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>We have a national transportation safety</v>
<v Speaker 2>board that goes in and investigates</v>
