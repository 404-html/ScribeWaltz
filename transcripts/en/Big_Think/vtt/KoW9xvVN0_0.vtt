1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.160
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we had to start from the fact,</v>

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody once said to me,</v>

4
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't march in the sixties so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>men could sleep together.</v>

6
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.871
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

7
00:00:17.871 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the right mack is byard Rustin</v>

8
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 2>had that held down like the man who</v>
<v Speaker 2>planned the march on Washington was,</v>

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 2>was gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was known to be gay,</v>

10
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

11
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 2>and that was okay with Dr King and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was okay with Julian bond and John Lewis</v>

12
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:32.504
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

13
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:33.420
<v Speaker 2>it's okay now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 2>I only regrets it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by residents,</v>

15
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 2>they still isn't with us planning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planning,</v>

16
00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 2>planning marches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we have to start from the</v>

17
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 2>premise that gay people are part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>NAACP.</v>

18
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Gay people are part of the social</v>
<v Speaker 2>justice movement that gay,</v>

19
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 2>black people in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>live both of those identities as we all</v>

21
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 2>multiple identities.</v>

23
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

24
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 2>the Naacp for that reason has always</v>
<v Speaker 2>been quick to recognize,</v>

25
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 2>across a whole range of issues that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>common interests of black people as</v>

27
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 2>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 2>or multiple identities as black people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gay people as gay people.</v>

29
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 2>There are multiple shades of colors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues of police brutality,</v>

31
00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 2>employment discrimination,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hate crimes.</v>

32
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
<v Speaker 2>We've been there side by side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting on again and again.</v>

33
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we set a big victory.</v>

34
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 2>The Matthew Shepard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Byrd,</v>

35
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 2>bill at the NAACP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ads in Texas to promote and really</v>

36
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 2>to beat up on then governor about to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become President Bush for his lack of</v>

37
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 2>support 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're out there now in the</v>

38
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 2>employment nondiscrimination act and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're out there now in Uganda.</v>

39
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we,</v>

40
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hate the definitely because it's the</v>

41
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 2>death penalty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we also,</v>

42
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:45.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

43
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 2>we hate it all the more when you say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

44
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to make being a member of</v>

45
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.160
<v Speaker 2>a minority group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any minority group,</v>

46
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 2>the reason that you get the death</v>
<v Speaker 2>penalty and that's what they're trying</v>

47
00:01:54.891 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 2>to do in Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to actually make being</v>

48
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 2>gay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 2>a crime punishable by death.</v>

50
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there has been distanced recently</v>

51
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 2>has been between religious communities</v>
<v Speaker 2>in general and the Movement for marriage</v>

52
00:02:10.011 --> 00:02:14.330
<v Speaker 2>equality and the NAACP has a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious base and people who want to</v>

53
00:02:14.331 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>see movement on that issue of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanting to feel like people want to see</v>

54
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 2>more blacks in the Republican Party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A need to invest in outreach,</v>

55
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>need to really say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

56
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>what that constituency as a priority</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

57
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 2>and I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>make it my business to make sure that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach out to that consumer constituency</v>

59
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 2>on their terms in the way that's most</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective.</v>

60
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 2>That's what any good organizer does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I do for the issues that I'm</v>

61
00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>pushing the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

62
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 2>with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julian Bond,</v>

63
00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:43.681
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

64
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.430
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our past chair is very outspoken in</v>

65
00:02:46.431 --> 00:02:47.600
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

66
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 2>I've let it be known that I personally</v>
<v Speaker 2>support marriage equality.</v>

67
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 2>My brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man who is closer to me than any man</v>

68
00:02:55.221 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>on this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

69
00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 2>my best friend since I was six years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

70
00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 2>we started six months and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his mom celebrated mother's Day with</v>

71
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 2>my mom and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his family lived with us off and on</v>

72
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>for a third of my life.</v>

73
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is gay,</v>

74
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 2>is HIV positive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a on again,</v>

75
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 2>off again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homeless.</v>

76
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've spent many a lot of money trying to</v>

77
00:03:15.791 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 2>keep them from being homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes people just,</v>

78
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues in their life that you,</v>

79
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that no dollar can overcome.</v>

80
00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's very personal for a lot of us I</v>

81
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>guess is what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we're a democratic organization at</v>

82
00:03:31.721 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day and that means that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to be on the front edge of some</v>

83
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>issues and we tend to lag behind on</v>
<v Speaker 2>others and we'd never get there until</v>

84
00:03:38.711 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 2>consensus as bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I say to folks,</v>

85
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you'd want to see the naacp even more</v>

86
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 2>active than we have been and we've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>active in California,</v>

87
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.150
<v Speaker 2>a folks there in California voted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppose prop eight and they,</v>

88
00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 2>and they rolled out all the stops to</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppose it.</v>

89
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 2>The National Office signed onto the</v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuit to invalidate probate because we</v>

90
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:03.031
<v Speaker 2>were able to get consensus on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>principle that I'm a simple majority</v>

91
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:06.130
<v Speaker 2>vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should not be able to trump a court's</v>

92
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>finding of a fundamental right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a threat to whole range of</v>

93
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the right to marry.</v>

94
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also,</v>

95
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:13.961
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 2>the right to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

97
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 2>be treated with respect in the workplace</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not discriminate against in the</v>

99
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.214
<v Speaker 2>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance.</v>

100
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>Apparently now it can be put up to a</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote in California.</v>

101
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

102
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.311
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

103
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 2>we have been involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

104
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:29.950
<v Speaker 2>gay people who have been involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>naacp for a long time.</v>

105
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 2>The Naacp has been supportive abroad</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil human rights agenda in this</v>

106
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>

107
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

108
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 2>rights for gay and lesbian people for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

109
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

110
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 2>and we have many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of our most outspoken leaders are,</v>

111
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 2>are very outspoken on the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 2>marriage equality and many are outspoken</v>

112
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

113
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like any other democratic organization</v>

114
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 2>and trade union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

115
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what have you,</v>

116
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 2>it's being worked through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way that one side wins or the</v>

117
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 2>other is that they decide that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they want the membership of the</v>

118
00:05:04.451 --> 00:05:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Naacp to be supportive of this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular part of the agenda more than</v>

119
00:05:08.981 --> 00:05:10.160
<v Speaker 2>the other side does.</v>
