1
00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ray Kurzweil and I've met ray several</v>

2
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:09.790
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a super good guy.</v>

3
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:11.820
<v Speaker 1>I like him a lot and I'm glad he's out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there doing it.</v>

4
00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.510
<v Speaker 1>In this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not skeptical in a cynical way.</v>

5
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I hope that those singularity people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

6
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope they're right.</v>

7
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>I hope he does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he lives forever because that</v>

8
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>means I may have a shot at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that would even mean living</v>

9
00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>

10
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>when people like ray say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schermer Schermer don't you want to live</v>

11
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>500 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand years,</v>

12
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

13
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 63,</v>

14
00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>just get me to like 80 without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>my brain going crazy and I'm losing my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind and Alzheimer's and senility and</v>

16
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get me to 100 without cancer and you</v>

17
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a 120 without being bedridden.</v>

18
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Know just one step at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one problem at a time.</v>

19
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>That's how progress really happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>incrementally.</v>

20
00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>Slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not this grand.</v>

21
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>Let's aim for Utopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean aimed for it.</v>

22
00:00:55.831 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

23
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>but just take it one step at a time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.981
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:58.981 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>there's like 50 different cancers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill people.</v>

26
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Just tackle them one by one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heart disease,</v>

27
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and senility.</v>

28
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:10.380
<v Speaker 1>You just solved those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because we know that the human body</v>

29
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>is so complex that if you live to 150 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,</v>

30
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>there may be other things that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know yet.</v>

31
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people 500 years ago had no idea</v>

32
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.940
<v Speaker 1>about Alzheimer's other than the handful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that seem to have lost their</v>

33
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:24.491
<v Speaker 1>memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

34
00:01:24.491 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we realize because most of so many</v>

35
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>of us live that long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem with um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.170
<v Speaker 1>with that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's too utopian in their thinking.</v>

38
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Just incremental steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then second,</v>

39
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.453
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

40
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.600
<v Speaker 1>my skeptical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical alarms always go off when the</v>

41
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:47.601
<v Speaker 1>chief proponent of an idea that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the next big thing always says</v>

42
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>it's in our generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>every religious leader and cult leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>in history is always said it's going to</v>

44
00:01:53.641 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>happen now in our generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the way back to Jesus who said there</v>

45
00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:03.261
<v Speaker 1>are some standing here before me now who</v>
<v Speaker 1>will not see the end of a time before I</v>

46
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're still waiting,</v>

49
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.813
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

50
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when ray said it's going to happen in</v>

51
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>2014 within our lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ray,</v>

52
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.770
<v Speaker 1>what if it's 2140?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you're gonna you're,</v>

53
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all the blood cleansing</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

54
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>but you're not going to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>like another century now and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

56
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even so,</v>

57
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>what if it's 31,</v>
<v Speaker 1>59,</v>

58
00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>30 1:40 a thousand years from now.</v>

59
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

60
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you and I aren't going to be here to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy,</v>

61
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why sell it like it's got to happen in</v>

62
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:40.851
<v Speaker 1>my lifetime because that always to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like you're just tickling that</v>

63
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>part of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that religions like to tap in that,</v>

64
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>that sort of egocentric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all about me and I want to continue</v>

65
00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>on in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get that,</v>

66
00:02:52.201 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 1>of course I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

67
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.420
<v Speaker 1>but all the more reason we should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical when that idea on the table</v>

68
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>being offered to us is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels too good to be true.</v>

69
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>It almost always is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Always,</v>

70
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.010
<v Speaker 1>but usually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's hardly anything bigger than</v>

72
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>offering in portrait and mortality or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the afterlife because.</v>

73
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.543
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the problem.</v>

74
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>When we are all aware that death is</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

75
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>because we see all around us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>

76
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>billion people have lived before us.</v>

77
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>They're all gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not One of them is come back.</v>

78
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>Not even Jesus in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a different video.</v>

79
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet you can't,</v>

80
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you cannot conceive of what it's like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be dead.</v>

81
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>Because if I asked you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture yourself dead,</v>

82
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>what do you see now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people say,</v>

83
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see myself there at the funeral and</v>

84
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the coffin and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my loved ones are,</v>

85
00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully grieving and there,</v>

86
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

87
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't see anything because to see</v>

88
00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.690
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be conscious to conceive of</v>

89
00:03:52.691 --> 00:03:53.760
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be a,</v>

90
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>you had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be conscious,</v>

91
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>and if you're dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any of that,</v>

92
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just really.</v>

93
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Death is just nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

94
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>and the whole idea of the afterlife is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly new.</v>

95
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ancient Hebrews,</v>

96
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>their idea of the afterlife was nothing.</v>

97
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>You're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just nothing.</v>

98
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>You're just gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

99
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 1>There's no place to go with angels and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flowers and whatever.</v>

100
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>It's just nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>all that was added on centuries later</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

102
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably for socio political</v>

103
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>offer the peasants something nice so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'll keep building our pyramids</v>

105
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

106
00:04:31.901 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

108
00:04:34.871 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>we can't conceive of what it's like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be done and yet we see it all around us.</v>

109
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>So this creates something of a paradox</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have to resolve in our minds.</v>

110
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Most people resolve it by thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not actually going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just not gonna do it.</v>

112
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to live forever or I'm going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept Jesus or whatever and I'm</v>

113
00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>going to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You okay?</v>

114
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if you're wrong?</v>

115
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

116
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a Pascal's wager where you can</v>

117
00:04:55.481 --> 00:04:55.711
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I've nothing to lose and everything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain because which religion and their</v>

119
00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:01.480
<v Speaker 1>version of the afterlife is the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

120
00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.440
<v Speaker 1>Which one are you going to pick?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>the Christians were the right ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

122
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a billion Muslims who disagree</v>

123
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:08.540
<v Speaker 1>with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

124
00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>they don't accept Jesus as a savior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't think he was even the</v>

125
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.120
<v Speaker 1>Messiah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the son of God.</v>

126
00:05:13.121 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now what?</v>

127
00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>You know and they believe just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly as you do.</v>

128
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>So what if your God is the wrong one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're your version is the wrong theory</v>

129
00:05:22.691 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>and they have the right one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You pick,</v>

130
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>you wasted your whole life investing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea and you turned out to be</v>

131
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not jettison the whole idea entirely</v>

132
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and appreciate the here and now because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all we have.</v>

133
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Whatever is in the hereafter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and now is what we have.</v>
