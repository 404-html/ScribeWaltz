1
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very interesting that it's so</v>

2
00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it's,</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.830
<v Speaker 1>it's not deterministic because</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout my life and medicine I have</v>

4
00:00:17.831 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 1>never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very rarely get a test back that is so</v>

5
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:22.510
<v Speaker 1>deterministic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

6
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>even when I was pregnant and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I get a variety of tests back and</v>

7
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:26.051
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

8
00:00:26.051 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is cutting your risk down for</v>

9
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>having a down syndrome baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's never,</v>

10
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>it's never 100 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>unless I did the Amnio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I did not do.</v>

12
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even things like cholesterol,</v>

14
00:00:37.541 --> 00:00:38.041
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

15
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:40.540
<v Speaker 1>if I find out have high cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

16
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:42.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a risk base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that I have a risk factor for</v>

17
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 1>heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it didn't tell me anything specific.</v>

18
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 1>some people even do very well with</v>
<v Speaker 1>having high cholesterol.</v>

20
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't say specifically you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to die of heart disease.</v>

21
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in my opinion,</v>

22
00:00:54.551 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>I've been very comfortable with having</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic tests that tell me that I</v>

24
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>might be at higher risk or lower risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on some,</v>

25
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 1>some information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the clerk to example that my</v>

26
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:08.950
<v Speaker 1>husband has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he already knew that he had a family</v>

27
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>history of Parkinson's disease and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows that there is a genetic basis</v>

28
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>for it and that he carries that genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis for it.</v>

29
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he already knew that there was the</v>

31
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 1>family history he has up there and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone through a lot of the</v>

32
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:25.210
<v Speaker 1>literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that he's found is</v>

33
00:01:25.211 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>that it's not that well studied just yet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it was a relatively recent</v>

34
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>discovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is information,</v>

35
00:01:31.001 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>there are about things you can do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent Parkinson's.</v>

36
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>So that could be changing your diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercising more and potentially drinking</v>

37
00:01:37.481 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

38
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those are all three things that he</v>

39
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

40
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the critics,</v>

41
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.250
<v Speaker 1>all three of those things are great for</v>
<v Speaker 1>his health regardless.</v>

42
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>So he has lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is much more vigilant about,</v>

43
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:50.161
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 1>eating vegetables and he is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink a little bit of coffee.</v>

45
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm really,</v>

46
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really happy that we got that</v>

47
00:01:57.431 --> 00:02:00.600
<v Speaker 1>information because even if it comes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>later that Oh,</v>

48
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>he has other genes that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>decreases risk and therefore he's sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of at average risk for Parkinson's.</v>

50
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'm used to getting that kind of</v>

51
00:02:08.921 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>information in that kind of change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>health care.</v>

52
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy because he made a lifestyle</v>

53
00:02:13.871 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 1>change that fundamentally made them</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier.</v>
