1
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Well think of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way we thought about it.</v>

2
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Where is the most defamation rooted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society?</v>

3
00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Still?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>what aspects of society is there still a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of homophobia,</v>

5
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against,</v>

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against the lgbt community?</v>

7
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And you look at the world of sports and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a long way to go.</v>

8
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And so we created the sports media</v>
<v Speaker 1>program to spark,</v>

9
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>start working with media professionals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cover the sports world.</v>

10
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.610
<v Speaker 1>When incidents come up that where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's either been an active defamation</v>

11
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>or there's an opportunity to educate</v>
<v Speaker 1>people through sports media,</v>

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>we want to have that kind of influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way we have the influence and</v>

13
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>the entertainment world and television</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows and films and so forth.</v>

14
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.500
<v Speaker 1>So the sports media program is working</v>
<v Speaker 1>without athletes on the college level.</v>

15
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some closeted athletes on the</v>

16
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>professional level still and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the opportunity to begin some</v>

17
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>of those dialogues.</v>

18
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 1>And then we're also talking to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional broadcast journalists,</v>

19
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>people who are sports casters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are writing stories about the</v>

20
00:01:04.701 --> 00:01:07.520
<v Speaker 1>sports world to see if we can have more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fair,</v>

21
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>accurate and inclusive representation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lgbt athletes.</v>

22
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Whether they're on whatever level</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in,</v>

23
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>but certainly there's a lot of young</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes who want to be able to compete.</v>

24
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe someday as professionals,</v>

25
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>certainly maybe in the Olympics and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know if they can be out.</v>

26
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great story.</v>

27
00:01:24.201 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>We got an email not long ago from a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mother who is saying,</v>

28
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my son is an amazing high school</v>

29
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>he's out and I want him to be able to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a college or university where he can</v>

31
00:01:35.541 --> 00:01:39.530
<v Speaker 1>be out as an athlete and be safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where should he go?</v>

32
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where can,</v>

33
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>where can he look too?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is his sport.</v>

34
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:44.600
<v Speaker 1>This is what he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is coming from a parent,</v>

35
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 1>which is just tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we shared some information with that</v>

36
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected them with some people at some</v>

37
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:53.120
<v Speaker 1>universities that are very supportive of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lgbt community.</v>

38
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.660
<v Speaker 1>And someday we'll be able to tell that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that young person's story,</v>

39
00:01:56.661 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 1>when he's very successful as an athlete.</v>
