00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were some very definite,</v>

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualities to good leaders will.</v>

3
00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>One is decisiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have decision anxiety,</v>

4
00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>it kind of says that you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence and people are frightened to</v>

5
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 1>be led by somebody who doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence,</v>

6
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't appear to know the direction</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the company is going.</v>

7
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always want to get in the trenches</v>

8
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>with somebody who you think is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>win the battle.</v>

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 1>And so confidence and is very big part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of leadership being decisive.</v>

10
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>I think having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>a sense of compassion is also important</v>
<v Speaker 1>for leadership because you can order</v>

12
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>somebody to come in on the weekends and</v>
<v Speaker 1>work over time,</v>

13
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>but you can't make them come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their best ideas.</v>

14
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>They have to do that because they care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about you and they want to please you</v>

15
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're a leader that motivates that</v>

16
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of passion in them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do that,</v>

17
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're just leading by being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictator or by fear,</v>

18
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually it's going to come back to,</v>

19
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bite you where you don't want to be</v>

20
00:01:15.881 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>better and you won't get the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dedication that you are looking right.</v>
