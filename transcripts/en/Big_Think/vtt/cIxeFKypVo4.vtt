1
00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will answer the question with the</v>

2
00:00:09.841 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>caveat that I've been on the job all</v>
<v Speaker 1>four months now,</v>

3
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:18.081
<v Speaker 1>and so I'm trying to understand that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater depth and see how it needs to be</v>

4
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>shaped going forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the basics are these,</v>

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.410
<v Speaker 1>there are four national,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three national academies,</v>

6
00:00:25.411 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in the US National Academy of</v>

7
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>National Academy of Engineering,</v>

8
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and the Institute of Medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>collectively we operate something called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Research Council.</v>

10
00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>Now in a nutshell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academies are chartered by the US</v>

11
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Congress to be literally the advisors to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nation in science,</v>

12
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:53.931
<v Speaker 1>engineering and medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sort of core activities of the</v>

13
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>National Academy of Engineering are</v>
<v Speaker 1>threefold.</v>

14
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>One is simply an honorific organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>through a,</v>

15
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

16
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>almost byzantine but very detailed</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

17
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>We try to select and elect as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a membership,</v>

18
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>the most accomplished engineers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country from both academia and industry</v>

19
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and elsewhere.</v>

20
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.230
<v Speaker 1>So honorific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:19.231 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>then we also administer a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>major prizes,</v>

22
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>particularly the draper prize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of the highest a prize</v>

23
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>that the private sector gives for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.530
<v Speaker 1>engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment.</v>

26
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 1>That's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who invented the jet engine</v>

27
00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:41.151
<v Speaker 1>in the world wide web and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the bulk of our work,</v>

28
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:45.570
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in producing reports on specific</v>

29
00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>topics generally requested by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress,</v>

30
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:53.511
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by ourselves on technological</v>

31
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>issues facing the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either very specific or sometimes much</v>

32
00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>broader and try to provide that advice</v>
<v Speaker 1>to how we keep a sound,</v>

33
00:02:03.661 --> 00:02:08.661
<v Speaker 1>a technological leadership in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So day to day is really a lot like day</v>

34
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:15.321
<v Speaker 1>to day was as a university president if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take away the students and you take</v>

35
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:21.351
<v Speaker 1>away the sometimes heavy emotional</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressures that one feels as a university</v>

36
00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm delighted to say that I'm always</v>

37
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>around bright people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>because we always have groups coming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and out to do studies,</v>

39
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders from industry leaders from</v>

40
00:02:33.631 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>university worrying about generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>large important,</v>

41
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:39.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 1>problems and trying to help shepherd</v>
<v Speaker 1>that process along to get the right</v>

43
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>people to do the right studies.</v>

44
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And then to help promulgate a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>what we find is sort of what constitutes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

46
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>the day to day a business that at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Naa,</v>

47
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>he and I have to tell you at least so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>

48
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm also traveling a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was on the road 36 days the last two</v>

49
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving speeches,</v>

50
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping to run meetings,</v>

52
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.630
<v Speaker 1>giving awards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these kinds of things.</v>

53
00:03:13.631 --> 00:03:15.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

54
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>a slow retirement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a retirement job.</v>

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.550
<v Speaker 1>I accepted this honor because I feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the future of this nation,</v>

56
00:03:26.201 --> 00:03:31.201
<v Speaker 1>and indeed the world is increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on having sound technological</v>

57
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:38.221
<v Speaker 1>leadership and strong science and</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and medicine undergirding</v>

58
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>our public policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What our industries are doing.</v>

59
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.390
<v Speaker 1>And I'm particularly interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to help people think about</v>

60
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:53.521
<v Speaker 1>what the evolving global context of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is and what our opportunities are,</v>

61
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>particularly for the next generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>young people.</v>
