1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>My book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychopath and site is a memoir and</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:09.231
<v Speaker 1>it's a mix of a personal story and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science is that it's the psychiatry</v>

3
00:00:09.331 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>and the genetics and the neuroscience</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind what the subject is,</v>

4
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>which is psychopathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really a story about somebody</v>

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>me who had 60 finds out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not really who he thought he was</v>

6
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>all along in his whole life and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>until I had,</v>

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>just by serendipity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by chance started to run across</v>

8
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>biological evidence first from pet</v>
<v Speaker 1>scans,</v>

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>positron emission tomography scans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>that I was involved with a acted as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>control in one study in Alzheimer's</v>

11
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker 1>disease and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>and also had my genetics done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was just as a control and compared</v>

13
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>to people with Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it was through that about,</v>

14
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.320
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

15
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.050
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago that I found out</v>

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>something very strange and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this something strange,</v>

17
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>both in terms of my brain pattern.</v>

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And then genetics happened to run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It intersected with another study.</v>

19
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>I had been doing a minor study on</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at pet scans and Mris.</v>

20
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>Another kind of brain scan and SPEC</v>
<v Speaker 1>scans of,</v>

21
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>of killers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad murderers and these are</v>

22
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker 1>particularly bad on brays and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killers,</v>

23
00:01:20.221 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had looked at these bananas to</v>

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>analyze them over the years from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 19 nineties onward and in,</v>

25
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>in about the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2005 when I was doing my own scans for</v>

26
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 1>the South San Study.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had got a whole group of these killers</v>

27
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>and a psychopath and looked at a pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sent my God,</v>

28
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>there's a pattern in the brain for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

29
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And so I started to talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give talks and uh,</v>

30
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at academic institutions and psychiatry</v>

31
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>departments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>law schools,</v>

32
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>etc. Just to kind of vet the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time I got this pile of</v>

33
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>scans back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>that included my own and these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>controls.</v>

35
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And I was looking through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to the last scan of that study at</v>

36
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the alzheimer's and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it and I asked my</v>

37
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.641
<v Speaker 1>technician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

38
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got to check the machines because</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is obviously one of the killers.</v>

39
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>So one of the murders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looked like a really,</v>

40
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>like a severe case of brain activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost in a psychopath.</v>

41
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And so when I ultimately they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

42
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>this is part of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in this control group.</v>

43
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And I had to tear back the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>the name on it because I always do</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything blind,</v>

45
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but this was like something's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and it turned out to be my name.</v>

46
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.811
<v Speaker 1>So it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:33.330
<v Speaker 1>gandalf shows up at the door and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

48
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And so that started this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>traJectory.</v>

49
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first I didn't think I laughed at it</v>

50
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just didn't care.</v>

51
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>We were so busy working on the genetics</v>
<v Speaker 1>of alzheimer's and also schizophrenia</v>

52
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.790
<v Speaker 1>and I had just started an adult stem</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell company.</v>

53
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so busy with stuff.</v>

54
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I kind of let it go for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

55
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>really a year and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then the genetics came back and I</v>

56
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:58.680
<v Speaker 1>had all the genetic illegals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the forms of the genes that are</v>

57
00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>associated with the high aggression and</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

58
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.650
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy and a low kind of empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpersonal,</v>

59
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>emotional empathy and low anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in it,</v>

60
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.750
<v Speaker 1>when I got that back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started to take a little bit of an but</v>

61
00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>it's still didn't care about it and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't until I ended up giving a talk,</v>

62
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I was asked to give a talk with the ex</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister of oslow and bipolar</v>

63
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to oslo to give a puBlic</v>

64
00:03:26.531 --> 00:03:30.850
<v Speaker 1>talk with him than a clinician on</v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar,</v>

65
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the brain patterns?</v>

66
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And I had to use my own example of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

67
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>you do imaging genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take imaging of the brain genetics,</v>

68
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>put it together in a mathematIcal model</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we figure it out so it can be</v>

69
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>used for all sorts of psychiatry and</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine and in the audience or the</v>

70
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:50.860
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrist there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went through my own pathologies,</v>

71
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or near clinical syndromes and my</v>

72
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>netflix and my brain scan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end the head of the</v>

73
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>department there said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't even know this.</v>

74
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.281
<v Speaker 1>I bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

75
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you're bipolar first of all because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the kind of bipolar in the</v>

76
00:04:03.251 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>United States that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they use.</v>

77
00:04:04.931 --> 00:04:06.940
<v Speaker 1>What are the kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's interesting.</v>

78
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to talk to you afterwards.</v>

79
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>So I met with the psychiatrist</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards and they said,</v>

80
00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you're probably borderline psychopath to</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at all this.</v>

81
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.640
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>this was kind of a real surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a first time I took it seriously</v>

83
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>because I had not only the biological</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence,</v>

84
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 1>but these people didn't even know me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just looking at the data,</v>

85
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they could see my behaviors.</v>

86
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>And in talking to me for a couple hours</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that talk at somebody's house,</v>

87
00:04:30.401 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably do.</v>

88
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>So when I flew back to the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

89
00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I did is I started,</v>

90
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started asking the psychiatrist and</v>

91
00:04:39.851 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>neurologist that I knew really well for</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years and who know my behaviors,</v>

92
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>including my not so nice behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

93
00:04:46.511 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>you gotta tell me what you really think</v>
<v Speaker 1>of me.</v>

94
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And each one of them had said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

95
00:04:50.891 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we told you for many years,</v>

96
00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:53.790
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

97
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.511
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>you do psychopathic things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably a borderline psychopath.</v>

99
00:04:57.221 --> 00:04:58.180
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

100
00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.431
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

101
00:04:58.431 --> 00:04:58.540
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

102
00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.210
<v Speaker 1>You said I was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we never said and be crazy</v>

103
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>and act crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're like a borderline psychopath.</v>

104
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Then I asked all my close friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

105
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>people in my family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they all had the same thing to say.</v>

106
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.960
<v Speaker 1>And at that point</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really kind of hit me.</v>

107
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:17.171
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>this is maybe true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started to take the test for</v>

109
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>psychopathy and it came up borderline</v>
<v Speaker 1>borderline psychopath that is a very</v>

110
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:26.530
<v Speaker 1>high score,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but without being at what's called the</v>

111
00:05:26.531 --> 00:05:31.531
<v Speaker 1>categorical full blown a psychopath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which contains these anti,</v>

112
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 1>a lot of antisocial and criminal parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

113
00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>And since I'm not a criminal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had conversations with the police</v>

114
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am always able to kind of talk my</v>

115
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>way out of it and get them to lAugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

116
00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:05:42.431 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>but I have no record or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

118
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I've done some fun things now.</v>

119
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>And so at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was just sitting with these two</v>

120
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>psychiatrists and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got all this evidence in front of</v>

121
00:05:55.151 --> 00:05:55.880
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

122
00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you see what's going at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you,</v>

123
00:05:57.981 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 1>I didn't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't care at all.</v>

124
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And they said that's the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't care.</v>

125
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.710
<v Speaker 1>so that at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

127
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.481
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

128
00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I had started to beg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave a ted talk and then a moth talk</v>

129
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 1>world science festival and then I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>contacted by some people,</v>

130
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>a different prime shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be on criminal minds and</v>

131
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But after that I got contacted by the</v>

132
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>same day by three literary agents in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York and they said,</v>

133
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:29.510
<v Speaker 1>you've got to read a book on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But people really interested in this.</v>

134
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>And it was personal too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I wrote the book,</v>

135
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.790
<v Speaker 1>I really met and had a heart to heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk with my old family.</v>

136
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is going to be,</v>

137
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.110
<v Speaker 1>it could be embarrassing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

138
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 1>for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There could be some exposure and risk,</v>

139
00:06:42.081 --> 00:06:47.081
<v Speaker 1>but they were sort of a heroic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had to count on my own narcissism</v>

140
00:06:48.051 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>to drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

141
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.851
<v Speaker 1>I can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:06:49.851 --> 00:06:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I can beat this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write this.</v>

143
00:06:50.941 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>I am tough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I kind of use some of the traits</v>

144
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.540
<v Speaker 1>to drive it forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

145
00:06:56.541 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so actually coming out like this,</v>

146
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also assured that I couldn't get away</v>

147
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>with things anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

148
00:07:04.881 --> 00:07:06.320
<v Speaker 1>and when you tell people what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>

149
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.380
<v Speaker 1>like I do in the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the things they're looking for</v>

150
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

151
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's so it's like,</v>

152
00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my game is up in,</v>

153
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.350
<v Speaker 1>in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also 66.</v>

154
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:17.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I really want to be that way</v>

155
00:07:17.451 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>anymore?</v>

156
00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.793
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have fun with it,</v>

158
00:07:20.451 --> 00:07:22.370
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the challenge,</v>

159
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:22.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

160
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a challenge and I think I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcome it.</v>

161
00:07:24.621 --> 00:07:29.621
<v Speaker 1>So I have to use my ego and my sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>narcissism to manipulate myself to</v>

162
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:32.080
<v Speaker 1>handled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

163
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

164
00:07:33.201 --> 00:07:35.240
<v Speaker 1>but it was really my family that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go for it.</v>

165
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 1>My mother is still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she'll say,</v>

166
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're saying too much.</v>

167
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.830
<v Speaker 1>You'd saying way too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I said my,</v>

168
00:07:42.831 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what the half of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

169
00:07:44.241 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>of course I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're alive and my family's</v>

170
00:07:47.391 --> 00:07:48.224
<v Speaker 1>alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my kids,</v>

171
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you know,</v>

172
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:54.050
<v Speaker 1>a piece of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I give a fair amount in the book</v>

173
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.140
<v Speaker 1>more than in my talks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I asked the psychiatrist who'd known</v>

174
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>me as nomi for many years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what behaviors that are not so obvious</v>

175
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:07.100
<v Speaker 1>that I do talk to people that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopathic.</v>

176
00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>And they asked me about revenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I getting even that?</v>

177
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Everybody gets mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

178
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Somebody ticks you off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get mad.</v>

179
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.020
<v Speaker 1>He could make five seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 seconds,</v>

180
00:08:18.021 --> 00:08:19.400
<v Speaker 1>a minute up to an rp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>

181
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a normal thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And your serotonin kicks in after about</v>

182
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>five minutes at a cools you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And psychopaths,</v>

183
00:08:25.731 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stays on.</v>

184
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.910
<v Speaker 1>It stays on a hard boil a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even though he could control it,</v>

185
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.120
<v Speaker 1>you're still angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can stay angry for extremely long</v>

186
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

187
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:41.960
<v Speaker 1>and that is sort of set up in utero</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those areas of the brain that</v>

188
00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:45.950
<v Speaker 1>respond to serotonin are altered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>these so called warrior gene,</v>

189
00:08:45.951 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 1>so they don't respond when you get</v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

190
00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 1>when the serotonin would have made you</v>
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>

191
00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.690
<v Speaker 1>And so psychopath will get very angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll stay angry.</v>

192
00:08:53.691 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And in the case of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mine,</v>

193
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I what I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I told them,</v>

194
00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.940
<v Speaker 1>the two of the psychiatrists were very</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to me.</v>

195
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:00.961
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

196
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>when I get mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't show it to anybody.</v>

197
00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could be furious at you.</v>

198
00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:07.280
<v Speaker 1>You would never know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I show no anger whatsoever at don't show</v>

199
00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:10.050
<v Speaker 1>anxious anxiety to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

200
00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:11.100
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll never know.</v>

201
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could sit on it for a year or two or</v>

202
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>three or five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get you.</v>

203
00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And I always do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they don't know where it's coming</v>

204
00:09:20.191 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't tie it to the event.</v>

205
00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.530
<v Speaker 1>And that comes out of nowhere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something dramatic happens in their</v>

206
00:09:25.531 --> 00:09:27.600
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm very careful,</v>

207
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost pristine about it.</v>

208
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a fair response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a proportional response.</v>

209
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody does something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do a lot,</v>

210
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:37.313
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

211
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.390
<v Speaker 1>you could say anything to me and I won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get mad.</v>

212
00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not at those things.</v>

213
00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:42.960
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's trying to get me.</v>

214
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:44.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like another cycle path or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.580
<v Speaker 1>somebodies trying to mess with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

216
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:49.560
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a high threshold.</v>

217
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.150
<v Speaker 1>So many things really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me mad.</v>

218
00:09:51.151 --> 00:09:52.580
<v Speaker 1>You could just about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything.</v>

219
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty cool that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've really do.</v>

220
00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Then I always get even and it in it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make sure it's the same sort of</v>

221
00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:01.600
<v Speaker 1>intensity that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

222
00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:06.260
<v Speaker 1>their initial damage and I said I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>stay cool and it'll happen in these.</v>

223
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Still look around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't what happened with their job,</v>

224
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>what happened with their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>

225
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>They'll they won't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they both said that psychopath.</v>

226
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.760
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so some of the,</v>

227
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at the bbc and in Australia who I</v>

228
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 1>had talked to some science writers this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what dexter is.</v>

229
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:25.021
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really,</v>

230
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 1>when I saw dexter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I absolutely understood it because he</v>

231
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>was being fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being fair to the universe and the world</v>

232
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:33.610
<v Speaker 1>of ethics of the universe.</v>

233
00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>He was absolutely fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A morality wise,</v>

234
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:38.020
<v Speaker 1>not so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

235
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 1>I could really understand that behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the surprises for me,</v>

236
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about starting about six years ago and</v>

237
00:10:46.201 --> 00:10:49.800
<v Speaker 1>for the few years until now when I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

238
00:10:49.801 --> 00:10:52.980
<v Speaker 1>there's something is really wrong that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not cognizant of.</v>

239
00:10:52.981 --> 00:10:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know I had this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

240
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

241
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.300
<v Speaker 1>even though other people did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

242
00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.190
<v Speaker 1>they won't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.570
<v Speaker 1>once I asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>

244
00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:04.890
<v Speaker 1>of course you're that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But so people protect people close to</v>

245
00:11:04.891 --> 00:11:06.700
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They protect our tormentors.</v>

246
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a family,</v>

247
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>stockholm effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've interviewed some really</v>

248
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Speaker 1>dangerous bad guys in prison and who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll protect theIr tormentors.</v>

249
00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:17.820
<v Speaker 1>And so the left hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

250
00:11:17.970 --> 00:11:20.370
<v Speaker 1>you won't find this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to ask and you have to say,</v>

251
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get even with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just telling me the truth and you say it</v>

252
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.320
<v Speaker 1>to enough people that they know you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

253
00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll find that out.</v>

254
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>So when that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I started to think,</v>

255
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:31.441
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

256
00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:33.840
<v Speaker 1>how can I change this without anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing?</v>

257
00:11:33.841 --> 00:11:37.420
<v Speaker 1>So I just started with my wife a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years ago.</v>

258
00:11:37.421 --> 00:11:40.620
<v Speaker 1>I started and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time I was about to do something</v>

259
00:11:40.621 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>with her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

260
00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:45.380
<v Speaker 1>we're pouring a glass of wine or eating</v>
<v Speaker 1>or going to a show,</v>

261
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.660
<v Speaker 1>anything I would stop for one moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

262
00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

263
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 1>And I noticed that every time I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>about to do something with her,</v>

264
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.050
<v Speaker 1>it was the absolutely the most selfish</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

265
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And for regular behavior it's like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pour yourself the wine first,</v>

266
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you serve yourself first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to get out of some duties even</v>

267
00:12:03.011 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>though you'd make it look like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you're cleaning up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also it gets worse than that.</v>

269
00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:10.720
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for bIrthdays or you know,</v>

270
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:15.040
<v Speaker 1>if there was a big party going on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a death in the family,</v>

271
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.010
<v Speaker 1>an uncle or an aunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought there's another party,</v>

272
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:19.600
<v Speaker 1>I would make up an excuse to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

273
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:23.500
<v Speaker 1>I would just blow off those things and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would extend it to everything I</v>

274
00:12:23.501 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 1>and even to the people who were close to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to not only family,</v>

276
00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:30.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

277
00:12:30.001 --> 00:12:32.170
<v Speaker 1>and I noticed that and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geez,</v>

278
00:12:32.171 --> 00:12:34.600
<v Speaker 1>I said everything I'm doing is maximally</v>
<v Speaker 1>like selfish,</v>

279
00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:38.310
<v Speaker 1>so I have to slow myself down now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to just do the correct thing.</v>

280
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They're very small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to start small because that's</v>

281
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:43.810
<v Speaker 1>where you have to start because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other stuff is true.</v>

282
00:12:43.811 --> 00:12:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Traumatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really try to change yourself.</v>

283
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:48.970
<v Speaker 1>But I've tried doing this and I noticed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and I didn't tell her I was doing</v>

284
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:53.190
<v Speaker 1>this and other people and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like your behavior and it's,</v>

285
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're different.</v>

286
00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.853
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

287
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.830
<v Speaker 1>And I told them and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

288
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:57.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really mean it.</v>

289
00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.160
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife,</v>

290
00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:01.210
<v Speaker 1>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care.</v>

291
00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.000
<v Speaker 1>You just treating me better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

292
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:06.850
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

293
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:09.540
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had taken that whole thing of empathy,</v>

294
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:14.570
<v Speaker 1>meaning beyond what people behaviorally</v>
<v Speaker 1>are asking for and everybody in my life,</v>

295
00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:18.940
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what people's motivations are?</v>

296
00:13:18.941 --> 00:13:21.250
<v Speaker 1>If you're treating me well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means you're trying and that's all</v>

297
00:13:21.251 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 1>that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This blew me away and I just,</v>

298
00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I really still don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I keep trying to do that.</v>

299
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I.</v>

300
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:30.700
<v Speaker 1>But I have to stop myself and in each</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these,</v>

301
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:33.910
<v Speaker 1>anytime I do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's the right thing to do?</v>

302
00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're somebody like me.</v>

303
00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 1>You realize your whole day is spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of times during the most</v>

304
00:13:39.131 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>selfish thing.</v>
