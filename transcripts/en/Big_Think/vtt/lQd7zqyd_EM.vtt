00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talk lately about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>role the privatization of space might</v>

2
00:00:03.711 --> 00:00:08.711
<v Speaker 1>play in our future ambitions of space</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration and from where I sit,</v>

3
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of delusional thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike what Newt Gingrich said in a</v>

5
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.100
<v Speaker 1>presidential debate there he is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had we given the money we had given to</v>

6
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the private sector,</v>

7
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.050
<v Speaker 1>we would have been on the moon and Mars</v>
<v Speaker 1>by now and we'd have done it more</v>

8
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Speaker 1>cheaply and everything would be fine and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dandy.</v>

9
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work that way.</v>

10
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Private enterprise in the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization has never led</v>

11
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.840
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>dangerous projects with unknown risks.</v>

13
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>That has never happened because when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>combine all these factors,</v>

14
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 1>you cannot create a capital market</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuation of that activity.</v>

15
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>The first Europeans to the new world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not sailors on the Dutch east</v>

16
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>India trading company ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was Columbus,</v>

17
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>it was Magellan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these were voyages funded by</v>

18
00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody has to draw the maps.</v>

19
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody has to see where the dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>spots are,</v>

20
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>where it's safe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the prevailing winds are.</v>

21
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Once that is established,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then private enterprise can come in and</v>

22
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the risk.</v>

23
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I need an investor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's your payback.</v>

24
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>If we can turn this into an enterprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no private enterprise is not going to</v>

25
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>lead us to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to lead us to Mars.</v>

26
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>What'd be nice for them to do is take on</v>
<v Speaker 1>our low earth orbit.</v>

27
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Activity's been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done that back in the sixties.</v>

28
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Low Earth orbit was a frontier we didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know who can humans survive?</v>

29
00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Can you even swallow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were in orbit,</v>

30
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>would saliva get caught in your throat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simple questions like that were unknown</v>

31
00:01:53.441 --> 00:01:57.040
<v Speaker 1>and unanswered at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're well past that.</v>

32
00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>We know how to get to low earth orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's done.</v>

33
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>The patents are offered or given</v>
<v Speaker 1>granted,</v>

34
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>and so that'd be the ideal place for</v>
<v Speaker 1>private enterprise to take over.</v>

35
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Tourism would easily drive that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

36
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 1>Americans in the world spends on</v>
<v Speaker 1>tourism.</v>

37
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>You can have a tourist lotteries if</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could win a much more</v>

38
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 1>expensive vacation than you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise afford.</v>

39
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>I certainly buy lottery tickets if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant taking a vacation in space or</v>

40
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>rather in orbit around Earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I guess we'll still call that</v>

41
00:02:28.091 --> 00:02:30.430
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if NASA is advancing a spaceman tier</v>

42
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:33.190
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda really just driving around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the block at that point,</v>

43
00:02:33.191 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>but that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could surely sell tickets and I'd.</v>

44
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>I'd be first in line.</v>
