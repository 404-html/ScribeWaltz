1
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>The true crime stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has good points and bad</v>

2
00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good points because it is literally</v>

3
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>saving people's lives when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about cases where you have</v>

4
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>innocent people sentenced to death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have innocent people are doing life</v>

5
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:25.551
<v Speaker 1>without parole and it happens way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>often than people have any idea.</v>

6
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Bryan Stevenson who works</v>

7
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>with the southern poverty law center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking to him one time and he</v>

8
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>said that they now estimate that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many as one out of every 10 people</v>

9
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>executed are innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if one out of every 10 planes</v>

10
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 1>crashed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody would fly anymore.</v>

11
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Everybody would demand that something be</v>
<v Speaker 1>done before they got on another plane.</v>

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>But most people don't know anyone that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are and they're not connected in any way</v>

13
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>to the death penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of just being swept under</v>

14
00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>the rug and a lot of ways.</v>

15
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.040
<v Speaker 1>So the true crime stuff is bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that into mainstream</v>

16
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:00.020
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it's saving people's lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

18
00:01:03.781 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>you have the other stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really tawdry,</v>

19
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and I can't think of a case right off</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top of my head,</v>

20
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just people like to sort of wallow in</v>

21
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.780
<v Speaker 1>the darkness of humanity a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>say people who want to read stuff about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Ramirez,</v>

23
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:21.660
<v Speaker 1>the night stalker guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sort of goes the other route.</v>

25
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think when you,</v>

26
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.920
<v Speaker 1>whatever you focus on is going to sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dictate the direction that your life</v>

27
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>moves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you focus on things that inspire you,</v>

28
00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>that uplift you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that raise you up,</v>

29
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.670
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be a happier person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're focusing more on the basest</v>

30
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bottom dregs of human activity,</v>

31
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>then you're probably not going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy person.</v>

32
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna manifest in depression and</v>

33
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.300
<v Speaker 1>despair and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

35
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see the good points of</v>

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>true crime and I see the bad points of</v>
<v Speaker 1>true crime.</v>

37
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>For me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to stay away from it.</v>

38
00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I honestly have not even seen the</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise lost documentaries.</v>

39
00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>I tried to watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watch them,</v>

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.830
<v Speaker 1>I made it through 15 to 20 minutes of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first one and I could understand why</v>

41
00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:20.520
<v Speaker 1>it had such a big impact on people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when I was watching it,</v>

42
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>it felt like being in the courtroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like experiencing it again.</v>

43
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>And for me that was the last thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world that I wanted.</v>

44
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ate up 20 years of my life.</v>

45
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>So the last thing I wanted to do is go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back there at the same time.</v>

46
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm grateful that so many other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>did watch it and were affected by it and</v>

47
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>came to our aid because it saved my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

48
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean I want to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

49
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.780
<v Speaker 1>The hardest parts of being in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst parts to deal with or just the</v>

50
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>sheer brutality of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>there were times when I was beaten so</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad that I started to piss blood.</v>

52
00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to spend a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and money and energy taking care of</v>

54
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan on killing.</v>

55
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you're going to see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>real doctor or a real dentist,</v>

56
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

57
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.770
<v Speaker 1>at one point I'd been hit in the face so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many times by prison guards that had</v>

58
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>caused a lot of nerve damage in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>teeth.</v>

59
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.780
<v Speaker 1>So I was in horrendous pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your choices are live in pain or let</v>

60
00:03:13.781 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>them pull your teeth out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want them to pull my teeth out.</v>

61
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>So I had to find techniques that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me to cope with the physical pain.</v>

62
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.700
<v Speaker 1>That was probably the biggest thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept pushing me forward to learn more</v>

63
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>and more and more about magic because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to find ways just to survive.</v>

64
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Magik spelled with a k at the end.</v>

65
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>They may gick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>the reason it has a k is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate it from sleight of hand.</v>

67
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a song assistance in half,</v>

68
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>pulling rabbits out of hats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

69
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>For the entire point of high magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a path that leads to the same</v>

70
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>things at eastern traditions refer to as</v>
<v Speaker 1>enlightenment,</v>

71
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.970
<v Speaker 1>which is the disillusion of the self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The form that I practice a derived for</v>

72
00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>the most part from the late 18 hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>in London,</v>

73
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.100
<v Speaker 1>you had a group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>they called themselves a hermetic order</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Golden Dawn.</v>

75
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Some really intelligent people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

76
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the poet web gates was a member.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they set out to do was look into</v>

77
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>all religious traditions in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get to just the practices,</v>

78
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you strip away the dogma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief systems,</v>

79
00:04:23.051 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>things like that and get to just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices and they wanted to figure out</v>

80
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>what works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why it works,</v>

81
00:04:27.911 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and how we can make it work better.</v>

82
00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>And it's ideally suited to people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>West because it uses,</v>

83
00:04:34.751 --> 00:04:35.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was saying,</v>

84
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Christian Judaic things of that nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iconography.</v>

85
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's things that are really deeply</v>
<v Speaker 1>ingrained in our psyches already.</v>

86
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.223
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

87
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.500
<v Speaker 1>when I was in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually also received ordination in</v>

88
00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 1>the Rinzai Zen tradition of Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddhism.</v>

89
00:04:49.331 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>It was a tradition that used to train</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Samurai in ancient Japan.</v>

90
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>So I sat zen meditation for years and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>still feel like I got more out of</v>

91
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:02.680
<v Speaker 1>ceremonial magic and month than I did</v>
<v Speaker 1>zen in years.</v>

92
00:05:02.681 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Just because it is more it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It deals with things that are more</v>

93
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>deeply ingrained in the western psyche</v>
<v Speaker 1>than eastern traditions.</v>

94
00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of it,</v>

95
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of yourself as a cup of water.</v>

96
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just leave a cup of water sitting</v>

97
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:17.410
<v Speaker 1>somewhere for a long period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it starts to stagnate.</v>

98
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It's going to accumulate debris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's even going to start to clot</v>

99
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:26.101
<v Speaker 1>up over a long enough period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What ceremonial magic tries to do is</v>

100
00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.320
<v Speaker 1>invoke certain energies into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

101
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to take that cup of water</v>

102
00:05:31.061 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>that's stagnant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cup of water and just hold it under a</v>

103
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>running faucet and just let it run until</v>
<v Speaker 1>it spills over the ram and hold it there</v>

104
00:05:37.391 --> 00:05:39.340
<v Speaker 1>and just let it spill and spill and</v>
<v Speaker 1>spill.</v>

105
00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Eventually what's gonna happen is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>that debris,</v>

106
00:05:41.201 --> 00:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>all that stagnation is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>washed out.</v>

107
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens to us on an</v>
<v Speaker 1>energetic level.</v>

108
00:05:45.941 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're constantly invoking all these</v>

109
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>energies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason they're at planetary</v>

110
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:52.210
<v Speaker 1>astrological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elemental,</v>

111
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>they're still all variations of a type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy that we have a name for an</v>

112
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>every single culture in the world except</v>
<v Speaker 1>ours.</v>

113
00:05:59.871 --> 00:06:00.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

114
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese call it CCI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese call it key,</v>

115
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>the Hebrews call it rock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indians call it Prada.</v>

116
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>In the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the only ones who don't really</v>

117
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>have a name for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's Kinda why I prefer just the</v>

118
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>generic term of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing I always tell people about</v>

119
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>magic is you're already doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just don't realize it yet and you're</v>

120
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>usually doing it to your own detriment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

121
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever we're thinking of health,</v>

122
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>we don't usually hold a picture in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads of ourselves as being vibrant and</v>

123
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>healthy and whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead we're thinking things like,</v>

124
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.630
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope I don't get the flu this year.</v>

125
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>The neighbors got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in the neighborhood's got it.</v>

126
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>So I'm probably gonna come down with it</v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

127
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Every time I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually get it twice as bad as</v>

128
00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:42.740
<v Speaker 1>everyone else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It lasts twice as long.</v>

129
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>So when we're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're actually doing is holding a</v>

130
00:06:46.101 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>visualization of ourselves as being sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our heads.</v>

131
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're putting energy into that.</v>

132
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>There's a phrase now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't remember who came up with</v>

133
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they say where attention goes,</v>

134
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>energy flows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're focusing on,</v>

135
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.150
<v Speaker 1>you are giving energy to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of magic is about training</v>

136
00:07:04.191 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>yourself to focus on what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of what you don't want.</v>

137
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we call thought forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more you can focus on what it is</v>

138
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>you're wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more energy you're putting onto it,</v>

139
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>which means the more powerful thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>form you're creating.</v>

140
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to resiliency,</v>

141
00:07:18.951 --> 00:07:23.951
<v Speaker 1>I think the thing that saved my life in</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was I found what I was supposed to</v>

142
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:28.040
<v Speaker 1>be doing in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As crazy as it sounds,</v>

143
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.880
<v Speaker 1>there were entire weeks would go by when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even think about the fact that</v>

144
00:07:31.881 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>I was in prison because I was so focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>on magic.</v>

145
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.980
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people even now,</v>

146
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.590
<v Speaker 1>people will come up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who have been through horrible</v>

147
00:07:39.591 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who suffer from depression of</v>

148
00:07:42.561 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>some sort and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what got you through that,</v>

149
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 1>what would bring you through these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

150
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.430
<v Speaker 1>And the honest answer is there are only</v>
<v Speaker 1>two causes of depression.</v>

151
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:56.150
<v Speaker 1>One is a chemical imbalance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which case the only thing that's</v>

152
00:07:56.151 --> 00:07:59.330
<v Speaker 1>going to correct it is medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of that nature to correct a</v>

153
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:03.560
<v Speaker 1>physical problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other cause in one way or another is</v>

154
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:08.120
<v Speaker 1>you're not doing what in magic we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>your will in Buddhism,</v>

155
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>they call it Dharma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that you're put here to</v>

156
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:13.490
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature.</v>

157
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>The Universe is not going to waste a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy making duplicate people,</v>

158
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:22.430
<v Speaker 1>making cookie cutter people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all here for a specific purpose</v>

159
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>and your purpose may be similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone else's,</v>

160
00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's not gonna be exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>because like I said,</v>

161
00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>the universe isn't going to waste that</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

162
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 1>The cause of happiness and the cause of</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is figuring out what you're</v>

163
00:08:39.021 --> 00:08:43.970
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be doing in this life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then dedicating yourself to it 100</v>

164
00:08:43.971 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>percent to the best of your ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From me,</v>

165
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.390
<v Speaker 1>that was doing magic when I started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>devote every minute of every day to</v>

166
00:08:52.611 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>doing magic while I was in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time I got out,</v>

167
00:08:54.831 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 1>I was doing it under eight hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once I started to do that,</v>

168
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.780
<v Speaker 1>everything else took a backseat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

169
00:09:00.781 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still went through horrendous things,</v>

170
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like beatings or starvation or whatever</v>

171
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:07.820
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

172
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>once it's done I get right back up and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to doing magic because it was what I</v>

173
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 1>loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

174
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started to figure out what was</v>

175
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>possible because of this and how it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting me on a mental level,</v>

176
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.590
<v Speaker 1>on an emotional level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a physical level,</v>

177
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>I was so excited about it that</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else just faded into the</v>

178
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:31.020
<v Speaker 1>background and I was happy even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>prison,</v>

179
00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:35.370
<v Speaker 1>even on death row for huge chunks of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

180
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:40.080
<v Speaker 1>I was happy because I was doing what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to be doing in the world.</v>

181
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 1>And still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:46.410
<v Speaker 1>the example I always give to people is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelangelo.</v>

183
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Whenever they asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you create these sculptures,</v>

184
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

185
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:54.990
<v Speaker 1>I just look at the block of marble and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>carved away anything that's not part of</v>

186
00:09:54.991 --> 00:09:57.720
<v Speaker 1>the figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where happiness comes from.</v>

187
00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>You look at your life and you start</v>
<v Speaker 1>carving away anything that's not</v>

188
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 1>pertinent to your life's mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

189
00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:07.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to parties.</v>

190
00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to clubs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go to concerts.</v>

191
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I don't Chit Chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

192
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.350
<v Speaker 1>anything that is not directly connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to magic,</v>

193
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.610
<v Speaker 1>I have gradually carved away from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life and it has made me a much,</v>

194
00:10:21.611 --> 00:10:25.090
<v Speaker 1>much happier person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social media.</v>

195
00:10:25.091 --> 00:10:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I honestly now I try to stay away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as much as I possibly can.</v>

196
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:34.710
<v Speaker 1>I think it can be useful for really down</v>
<v Speaker 1>to earth practical things like letting</v>

197
00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:37.150
<v Speaker 1>people know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

198
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.540
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll use it to let people know where I'm</v>

199
00:10:40.541 --> 00:10:43.450
<v Speaker 1>going to be doing a meditation class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things of that nature.</v>

200
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:48.280
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time I think it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly detrimental as far as what</v>

201
00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:50.530
<v Speaker 1>we're putting our energy into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

202
00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:55.460
<v Speaker 1>part of what magic is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is containing our energy containing are</v>

203
00:10:55.461 --> 00:11:00.190
<v Speaker 1>cheap because we disperse it constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We disperse it in everything we think</v>

204
00:11:00.191 --> 00:11:03.820
<v Speaker 1>about everything we talk about and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

205
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:08.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a study come out about a week or</v>

206
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.160
<v Speaker 1>so ago where scientists were pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we are now practically one</v>

207
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:16.090
<v Speaker 1>generation away from the extinction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity due to climate change,</v>

208
00:11:16.091 --> 00:11:17.740
<v Speaker 1>global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this sort of stuff.</v>

209
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Yet the only thing that people were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about on social media was Kanye</v>

210
00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:28.321
<v Speaker 1>west at the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really can be detrimental to our</v>

211
00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:32.830
<v Speaker 1>development if you let you know the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningless things or if you just spend</v>

212
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.530
<v Speaker 1>hours and hours a day combing through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

213
00:11:35.531 --> 00:11:39.460
<v Speaker 1>instagram photos of people taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfies,</v>

214
00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:42.880
<v Speaker 1>things of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you really have to be careful</v>

215
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.810
<v Speaker 1>with everything you consume and not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a physical way,</v>

216
00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:51.160
<v Speaker 1>but mentally and emotionally as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as everything that you put out.</v>

217
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I always try to be as mindful as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can about,</v>

218
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I take in through the Internet</v>

219
00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>and whatever I put out through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
