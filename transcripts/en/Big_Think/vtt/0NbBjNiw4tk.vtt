00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.793
<v Speaker 1>My name is professor Michio Kaku.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor of theoretical physics </v>

2
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>at the City University of New York and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialize in is something called string</v>

3
00:00:20.231 --> 00:00:21.064
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

4
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm a physicist and some people asked me</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

5
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>what has physics done for me lately?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.033
<v Speaker 1>do I get better colored television?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I get better Internet reception with </v>

7
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>physics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is yes.</v>

8
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.753
<v Speaker 1>Is he physics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that the very foundation of matter </v>

9
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>and energy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We physicists invented the laser beam.</v>

10
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.960
<v Speaker 1>We invented the transistor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We helped to create the first computer.</v>

11
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>We helped to construct the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We rode the world wide web.</v>

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also helped to invent television,</v>

13
00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.900
<v Speaker 1>radio radar microwave's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to mention MRI scans,</v>

14
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>pet scansx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rays.</v>

15
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything you see in your living</v>

16
00:01:07.911 --> 00:01:08.744
<v Speaker 1>room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost everything you see in a modern </v>

17
00:01:10.611 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>hospital at some point or other can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>traced to a physicist.</v>

18
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got interested in physics when I was a</v>

19
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>child when I was eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great scientist had just died.</v>

20
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.443
<v Speaker 1>I still remember my elementary school </v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher coming into the room and </v>

21
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.761
<v Speaker 1>announcing that the greatest scientist </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our era has just passed away and that</v>

22
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>day every newspaper published a picture </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his desk,</v>

23
00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>the desk of Albert Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the caption said,</v>

24
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.613
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget the unfinished </v>
<v Speaker 1>manuscript of the greatest work of the </v>

25
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 1>greatest scientists of our time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said to myself,</v>

26
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>why couldn't he finish it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>what's so hard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a homework problem,</v>

28
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:58.130
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't he ask his mother?</v>

29
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Why can't he finish this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a child of eight,</v>

30
00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I decided to find out what was this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>

31
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.263
<v Speaker 1>Years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I began to realize that it was the </v>

32
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.930
<v Speaker 1>theory of everything that unified field </v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

33
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.783
<v Speaker 1>an equation that would summarize all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical forces in the universe and </v>

34
00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:19.634
<v Speaker 1>equation like e equals MC squared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That equation is half an inch long and </v>

35
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>that equation unlocks the secrets of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars.</v>

36
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 1>Why do this star is shy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does the Galaxy light up?</v>

37
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:32.864
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have energy on the earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there was another thing that </v>

38
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 1>happened to me when I was around eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>years old.</v>

39
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.913
<v Speaker 1>I got hooked on the Saturday morning tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows in particular Flash Gordon and I </v>

40
00:02:46.461 --> 00:02:47.294
<v Speaker 1>was hooked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made every Saturday morning watching </v>

41
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:53.080
<v Speaker 1>programs about alien from outer space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>

42
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:55.990
<v Speaker 1>ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ray guns in visibility,</v>

43
00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:58.160
<v Speaker 1>shields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities in the sky.</v>

44
00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.293
<v Speaker 1>That was me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but after a few years I began to notice </v>

45
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

46
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I began to notice that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have blond hair and blue eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have muscles like Flash Gordon,</v>

48
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>but it was a scientist who made this </v>
<v Speaker 1>series work.</v>

49
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>In particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a physicist.</v>

50
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>He was the one who discovered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan,</v>

51
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.164
<v Speaker 1>the star ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the one who created the </v>

52
00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>invisibility shield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I realized something else.</v>

53
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.540
<v Speaker 1>If you want to understand the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand physics.</v>

54
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Physics is at the foundation of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gadgetry,</v>

55
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:35.764
<v Speaker 1>the wizardry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the marvels of the technological </v>

56
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of it can be traced to the work of a</v>

57
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:42.874
<v Speaker 1>physicist.</v>

58
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Most of science fiction is in fact well </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the laws of physics,</v>

59
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.103
<v Speaker 1>but possible within maybe 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we have impossibilities that </v>

60
00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>may take a thousand years or more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That includes time travel,</v>

61
00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>warp drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher dimensions,</v>

62
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>portals through space and time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stargates wormholes.</v>

63
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.253
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were to meet your great </v>

64
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>grandparents of the year 1900,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were dirt farmers back then.</v>

65
00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>They didn't live much beyond the age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>40 on average,</v>

66
00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.023
<v Speaker 1>long distance communication in the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>1900 was yelling at your neighbor and </v>

67
00:04:23.501 --> 00:04:24.334
<v Speaker 1>yet if they could see you now with ipads</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ipods and satellites and gps and </v>

68
00:04:30.131 --> 00:04:32.410
<v Speaker 1>laser beams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would they view you?</v>

69
00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>They will view you as a wizard or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sourcer.</v>

70
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.533
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can now meet our grandkids of the </v>

71
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.200
<v Speaker 1>year 2100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would we viewed them?</v>

72
00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>We would view them as gods like in Greek</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>

73
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>Zeus could control objects around him by</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure thought,</v>

74
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 1>materialized objects just by thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their perks being a Greek God.</v>

75
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Venus had a perfect body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a timeless body,</v>

76
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.203
<v Speaker 1>and we are beginning now to unravel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetics at the molecular level of the </v>

77
00:05:09.071 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>aging process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Apollo.</v>

78
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>He had a chariot that he could write </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the heavens.</v>

79
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.813
<v Speaker 1>We will finally have that flying car </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've always wanted to have in our </v>

80
00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>garage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the year 2100,</v>

81
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>we will have the power of the gods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To Paraphrase Arthur,</v>

82
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:26.134
<v Speaker 1>c dot Clarke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any sufficiently advanced technology is </v>

83
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:34.651
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from divinity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's now begin our story.</v>

84
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>The history of physics is the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern civilization.</v>

85
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Before Isaac Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Galileo,</v>

86
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.070
<v Speaker 1>we were shrouded with the mysteries of </v>
<v Speaker 1>superstition.</v>

87
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>People believed in all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of spirits and demons.</v>

88
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>What made the planets move?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why you do things,</v>

89
00:06:00.951 --> 00:06:03.470
<v Speaker 1>interact with other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a mystery.</v>

90
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>So back in the Middle Ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

91
00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:07.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people read the works of Aristotle and </v>

92
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle as the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do objects move toward the earth?</v>

93
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's because he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects yearn,</v>

94
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.420
<v Speaker 1>yearn to be united with the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do object slow down when you put</v>

95
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:27.230
<v Speaker 1>them in motion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Objects in motion slow down because they</v>

96
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the works of Aristotle,</v>

97
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.963
<v Speaker 1>which held sway for almost 2000 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the beginning of modern physics </v>

98
00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>with Galileo and Isaac Newton.</v>

99
00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.700
<v Speaker 1>When the ancients looked at the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky was full of mystery and wonder.</v>

100
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And in the year 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>66,</v>

101
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the most important date on the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar,</v>

102
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.323
<v Speaker 1>there was a comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a comment would sailed over the </v>

103
00:06:58.421 --> 00:06:59.254
<v Speaker 1>battlefield of hastings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It frightened the troops of King Harold </v>

104
00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:03.963
<v Speaker 1>and a young man from Normandy swept into</v>
<v Speaker 1>England and defeated King Harold at the </v>

105
00:07:10.001 --> 00:07:14.650
<v Speaker 1>battle of hastings creating the modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>British monarchy.</v>

106
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.550
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did the comment come from?</v>

107
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.593
<v Speaker 1>What was this comment that mysteriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>pave the way for the coming of the </v>

108
00:07:23.921 --> 00:07:26.500
<v Speaker 1>British monarchy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:28.930
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that same comment,</v>

110
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.530
<v Speaker 1>the very same comment that initiated the</v>
<v Speaker 1>British monarchy sailed over London once</v>

111
00:07:35.621 --> 00:07:39.670
<v Speaker 1>again in 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>82 this time,</v>

112
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:44.260
<v Speaker 1>everyone was asking the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do comments come from?</v>

113
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:45.363
<v Speaker 1>Do they signal the death of the king?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have messengers from the </v>

114
00:07:49.331 --> 00:07:52.060
<v Speaker 1>heavens in the sky?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

115
00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:56.020
<v Speaker 1>one man dare to penetrate the secrets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

116
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.450
<v Speaker 1>And that was Isaac Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

117
00:07:58.451 --> 00:07:59.284
<v Speaker 1>when Isaac Newton was only 23 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he stumbled upon the universal force of </v>

118
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:06.940
<v Speaker 1>gravitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to one story,</v>

119
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>he was walking on his estate and Wills </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thorpe,</v>

120
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.073
<v Speaker 1>and he saw an apple fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Isaac Newton saw the moon and </v>

121
00:08:15.821 --> 00:08:20.821
<v Speaker 1>then he asked the key question which </v>
<v Speaker 1>help to unlock the heavens if apples</v>

122
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:28.280
<v Speaker 1>does the moon also fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer was yes.</v>

123
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.433
<v Speaker 1>And that answer overturn thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of mystery and speculation about </v>

124
00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the emotions of the heavens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon is in free fall,</v>

125
00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:43.103
<v Speaker 1>just like an apple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moon is constantly falling toward </v>

126
00:08:46.771 --> 00:08:47.604
<v Speaker 1>the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't hit the earth because it </v>

127
00:08:49.801 --> 00:08:52.020
<v Speaker 1>spins around the earth and the earth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>round,</v>

128
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:57.180
<v Speaker 1>but it's acting under a force of force </v>
<v Speaker 1>of gravity.</v>

129
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>So Newton immediately try to work out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mathematics and he realized that the</v>

130
00:09:03.001 --> 00:09:03.834
<v Speaker 1>mathematics of the 16 hundreds was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient to work out the motion of </v>

131
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:09.954
<v Speaker 1>falling moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did Isaac Newton do when he was </v>

132
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:13.884
<v Speaker 1>23 years old?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only did he stumble upon the force </v>

133
00:09:16.741 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 1>of gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he also created calculus.</v>

134
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he created calculus at the rate at which</v>

135
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>you learn it when you're a freshman in </v>
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>

136
00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:29.280
<v Speaker 1>And why did he create calculus?</v>

137
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:33.150
<v Speaker 1>To calculate the motion of a falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>moon?</v>

138
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.463
<v Speaker 1>The mathematics of his age was incapable</v>
<v Speaker 1>of calculating the trajectories of </v>

139
00:09:38.551 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>objects moving under an inverse square </v>
<v Speaker 1>force field,</v>

140
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:46.220
<v Speaker 1>and that's what Isaac Newton did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked out the motion of the moon and</v>

141
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>then he realized that if he understands </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon,</v>

142
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:55.460
<v Speaker 1>he also understands the motion of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planets in the solar system,</v>

143
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.300
<v Speaker 1>and Isaac Newton invented a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>telescope.</v>

144
00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:01.493
<v Speaker 1>It was the reflecting telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was tracking the motion of this </v>

145
00:10:04.891 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.930
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that everyone was talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the comment,</v>

147
00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:14.931
<v Speaker 1>including a rather wealthy Englishman by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name of Edmund Halley.</v>

148
00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>So Edmund Halley being a wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchant,</v>

149
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.103
<v Speaker 1>decided to make a trip to Cambridge to </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to England's illustrious </v>

150
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.890
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir Isaac Newton.</v>

151
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edmund Halley ask Newton.</v>

152
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:32.460
<v Speaker 1>What do you make of this comment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one understands comments.</v>

153
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.473
<v Speaker 1>There are mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've been fascinating people for </v>

154
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Millennia.</v>

155
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:40.470
<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I paraphrase,</v>

156
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.110
<v Speaker 1>but Isaac Newton said something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

157
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.610
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

158
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.373
<v Speaker 1>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That comment is moving in a perfect </v>

159
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:49.734
<v Speaker 1>ellipse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's moving in an in an inverse square </v>

160
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:52.914
<v Speaker 1>force field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been tracking it every day with my </v>

161
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:59.310
<v Speaker 1>reflecting telescope and the path of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that comment,</v>

162
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 1>conform this to my mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

163
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Speaker 1>and of course we don't know what Edmund </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haley's reaction was by paraphrase.</v>

164
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 1>He must have said something like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For God's sake,</v>

165
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:12.624
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't you publish the greatest work </v>

166
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.603
<v Speaker 1>in all of scientific history if correct </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have decoded the secret of the </v>

167
00:11:22.501 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the secret of the heavens.</v>

168
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Nobody understands where comments come </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

169
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:31.170
<v Speaker 1>and then Newton responded and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

170
00:11:31.171 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cost too much.</v>

171
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a wealthy man.</v>

172
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.743
<v Speaker 1>It would cost too much to summarize this</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculus that I've invented and to work </v>

173
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>out all the motion of the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Haley must have said this,</v>

174
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Mr Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am a wealthy man.</v>

175
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.253
<v Speaker 1>I have made my fortune in commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will pay for the publication of the </v>

176
00:11:54.161 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 1>greatest scientific work in any </v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

177
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.620
<v Speaker 1>and it was praying Kimbia the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>

178
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>the mathematical principles that guide </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavens.</v>

179
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.083
<v Speaker 1>Believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is perhaps one of the most </v>

180
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:09.874
<v Speaker 1>important works ever written by a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the hundred thousand years </v>

181
00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:16.683
<v Speaker 1>since we evolved from Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realize that this book sets into motion </v>

182
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:22.653
<v Speaker 1>of physics of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces that control the motion of the </v>

183
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:28.384
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces which can be calculated forces </v>

184
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>which govern the motion of cannon balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rockets,</v>

185
00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.920
<v Speaker 1>pebbles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that moves,</v>

186
00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:44.220
<v Speaker 1>moves according to the laws of motion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the calculus of Sir Isaac Newton.</v>

187
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:46.053
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even today when we launch our space </v>

188
00:12:48.461 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 1>probes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't use Einstein's equations.</v>

189
00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:54.520
<v Speaker 1>They only apply when you get near the </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of light or near a black hole.</v>

190
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.730
<v Speaker 1>We use Newton's laws of gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are so precise that when we shoot a</v>

191
00:12:59.771 --> 00:13:02.740
<v Speaker 1>space probe right past the rings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturn,</v>

192
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.903
<v Speaker 1>we use exactly the same equations that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton unrivaled in the 16 </v>

193
00:13:08.921 --> 00:13:09.754
<v Speaker 1>hundreds.</v>

194
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.593
<v Speaker 1>That's why being able to unravel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrets of the solar system complements </v>

195
00:13:14.381 --> 00:13:15.214
<v Speaker 1>of the laws of motion of Isaac Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Newton did was not only did he </v>

196
00:13:20.831 --> 00:13:24.280
<v Speaker 1>set into motion the ability to calculate</v>
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>

197
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.383
<v Speaker 1>he also set into motion a mechanic's </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines now operated upon well defined </v>

198
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newton's three laws of motion.</v>

199
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:42.550
<v Speaker 1>The first law of motion says that </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects in motion stay in motion forever</v>

200
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 1>unless acted upon by an outside force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see that in an ice skating rink,</v>

201
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.250
<v Speaker 1>you shoot the puck and it goes all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way down forever,</v>

202
00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:56.320
<v Speaker 1>unless acted upon by an outside force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's different from Aristotle's law of</v>

203
00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:57.154
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle said objects in motion </v>

204
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:01.413
<v Speaker 1>eventually stop because they get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second law of Motion Says Force is </v>

205
00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:07.444
<v Speaker 1>mass times acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that equation made possible the </v>

206
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:11.970
<v Speaker 1>industrial</v>

207
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.060
<v Speaker 2>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steam,</v>

208
00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.410
<v Speaker 2>locomotives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>factories,</v>

209
00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:19.340
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of it,</v>

210
00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:24.341
<v Speaker 2>dude to the mechanics set into motion by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isaac Newton's second law of motion for</v>

211
00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:25.963
<v Speaker 1>us as equal to mass times acceleration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Newton had a third law of </v>

212
00:14:29.001 --> 00:14:29.834
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For every action there's an equal and </v>

213
00:14:31.671 --> 00:14:34.970
<v Speaker 1>opposite reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a law of rockets.</v>

214
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.060
<v Speaker 1>That's what we have rockets that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>assailant the artist space.</v>

215
00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.133
<v Speaker 1>So the lesson here is when scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>unraveled the first force of the </v>

216
00:14:44.031 --> 00:14:47.810
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity that set into motion,</v>

217
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:48.763
<v Speaker 1>the industrial revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a which toppled the kings and Queens of </v>

218
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:55.850
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which this place feudalism,</v>

219
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:56.923
<v Speaker 1>ushering in the modern age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all because a 23 year old gentleman </v>

220
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:06.880
<v Speaker 1>looked up and asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the moon also fall?</v>

221
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.883
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was a kid growing up in </v>

222
00:15:10.521 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see pictures of the empire state</v>

223
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>building and I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could they possibly build such a big</v>

224
00:15:17.511 --> 00:15:20.600
<v Speaker 1>building and not know that it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall?</v>

225
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.063
<v Speaker 1>Why doesn't it far?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't build scale models of the </v>

226
00:15:24.351 --> 00:15:25.184
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't have an empire state </v>

227
00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:27.014
<v Speaker 1>building that big that tests whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to fall in on how did they </v>

228
00:15:30.201 --> 00:15:33.890
<v Speaker 1>know ahead of time that that building </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't fall,</v>

229
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.160
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is Newton's laws of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motion.</v>

230
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.233
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today I teach Newton's laws of motion </v>

231
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:40.993
<v Speaker 1>and you can actually calculate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces on every single brick of the </v>

232
00:15:45.801 --> 00:15:50.801
<v Speaker 1>empire state building using Newton's </v>
<v Speaker 1>second law of Motion Force is mass times</v>

233
00:15:51.291 --> 00:15:52.124
<v Speaker 1>acceleration</v>

234
00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:56.000
<v Speaker 1>where Newton unraveled the force of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gravity.</v>

235
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.960
<v Speaker 1>That was the first force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's take a look at it,</v>

236
00:15:58.961 --> 00:16:01.430
<v Speaker 1>a second force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even greater for us,</v>

237
00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:06.580
<v Speaker 1>which has touched all of our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the electro magnetic force.</v>

238
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.153
<v Speaker 1>Ever since humans saw lightening bolts </v>
<v Speaker 1>light up the sky every since they were </v>

239
00:16:13.551 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>terrified by the sound of thunder </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been asking,</v>

240
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 1>do the gods propelled lightning bolts </v>
<v Speaker 1>and create funder?</v>

241
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:22.213
<v Speaker 1>Are they angry at us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists began to realize that the </v>

242
00:16:26.481 --> 00:16:31.220
<v Speaker 1>lightening bolts and the funder can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>duplicated on the earth,</v>

243
00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:35.540
<v Speaker 1>that we can actually create many </v>
<v Speaker 1>lightening bolts using electricity,</v>

244
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:41.350
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't until the 18 hundreds that</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally began to unlock the second great</v>

245
00:16:42.651 --> 00:16:44.450
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which rules the universe,</v>

246
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.613
<v Speaker 1>the electromagnetic force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Faraday would give Christmas </v>

247
00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:49.874
<v Speaker 1>lectures in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascinating everyone from adults to </v>

248
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:57.671
<v Speaker 1>children and he would demonstrate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible properties of electricity.</v>

249
00:16:58.820 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

250
00:16:59.961 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 1>ask a simple question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in a car or an airplane,</v>

251
00:17:02.961 --> 00:17:06.070
<v Speaker 1>you get hit by lightening bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you all get electrocuted?</v>

252
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you all die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

253
00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 1>fair to answer the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would create a cage.</v>

254
00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 1>He would walk into the steel cage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electrify it,</v>

255
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.660
<v Speaker 1>and he wouldn't get electrocuted at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called a faraday cage,</v>

256
00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.450
<v Speaker 1>and every time you walk into a middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

257
00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:27.230
<v Speaker 1>you get shielded by this metal object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

258
00:17:27.231 --> 00:17:28.064
<v Speaker 1>but Michael Faraday did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was he helped to unleash the second </v>

259
00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:35.750
<v Speaker 1>great revolution with something called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Faraday's law?</v>

260
00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm moving wire in a magnetic field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has this electrons pushed,</v>

261
00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:43.093
<v Speaker 1>creating an electrical current.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That simple idea unleashed the electric </v>

262
00:17:50.521 --> 00:17:51.354
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why we have hydroelectric </v>

263
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:55.440
<v Speaker 1>generators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn,</v>

264
00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.510
<v Speaker 1>that can produce enormous amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

265
00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:00.120
<v Speaker 1>That's why people build nuclear power </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>

266
00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.360
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have electricity in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>room right now on a very small scale.</v>

267
00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.233
<v Speaker 1>You use that in your bicycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you put a bicycle lamp on your </v>

268
00:18:08.761 --> 00:18:12.300
<v Speaker 1>bicycle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the turning of the wheel spins a magnet.</v>

269
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 1>The magnet then pushes electrons in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wire,</v>

270
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.410
<v Speaker 1>and that's why electricity lights up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your bicycle land.</v>

271
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:20.753
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity and magnetism where unified </v>

272
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:25.283
<v Speaker 1>into a single virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We once thought that electricity and </v>

273
00:18:27.781 --> 00:18:28.614
<v Speaker 1>magnetism were separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we know they are in fact the same </v>

274
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:36.990
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm moving magnet,</v>

275
00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:38.483
<v Speaker 1>then create an electric field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that a moving electric field </v>

276
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.460
<v Speaker 1>couldn't create a magnetic field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they can create each other,</v>

277
00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.533
<v Speaker 1>why can't they oscillate and create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wave so that moving electric fields </v>

278
00:18:54.421 --> 00:18:56.850
<v Speaker 1>create magnetic fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create electric fields,</v>

279
00:18:56.851 --> 00:19:00.570
<v Speaker 1>create magnetic fields in an item to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a wave?</v>

280
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the time of the American civil </v>

281
00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:04.104
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mathematical physicist James Clerk </v>

282
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:07.583
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell calculated using the work of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Farah day the velocity of this wave and </v>

283
00:19:12.331 --> 00:19:15.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest breakthroughs of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

284
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:16.643
<v Speaker 1>James Clerk Maxwell calculated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>velocity of this wave and found out it </v>

285
00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:21.264
<v Speaker 1>was the velocity of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he made this incredible </v>

286
00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.440
<v Speaker 1>discovery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is light.</v>

287
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:33.563
<v Speaker 1>That's what light is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't by accident travel at the </v>

288
00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:38.484
<v Speaker 1>speed of electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is light itself and the equations </v>

289
00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 1>were written down by James Clerk </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell.</v>

290
00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.373
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Farady himself did not have a </v>

291
00:19:48.271 --> 00:19:49.104
<v Speaker 1>formal education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could not put it into mathematical </v>

292
00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:52.860
<v Speaker 1>form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own work.</v>

293
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.150
<v Speaker 1>James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist like myself.</v>

294
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.193
<v Speaker 1>He wrote down the mathematical physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>of oscillating electric fields and </v>

295
00:20:01.981 --> 00:20:02.814
<v Speaker 1>magnetic fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are a called Maxwell's </v>

296
00:20:05.011 --> 00:20:05.844
<v Speaker 1>equations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These equations have to be memorized by </v>

297
00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:09.923
<v Speaker 1>every physicist in Grad school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot get your phd without </v>

298
00:20:14.071 --> 00:20:14.904
<v Speaker 1>memorizing these equations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every engineer who deals with radar and </v>

299
00:20:18.111 --> 00:20:22.530
<v Speaker 1>radio has to memorize these equations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so if you go to Berkeley where I got</v>

300
00:20:22.531 --> 00:20:23.364
<v Speaker 1>my phd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can buy a t shirt which says in the </v>

301
00:20:26.401 --> 00:20:27.234
<v Speaker 1>beginning God said the four dimensional </v>
<v Speaker 1>divergence of an anti symmetric second </v>

302
00:20:32.251 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 1>rank tensor equals zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was like,</v>

303
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.530
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the equation for light.</v>

304
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:48.400
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of the electromagnetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution touch all of us.</v>

305
00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.710
<v Speaker 1>This is a picture of the earth from </v>
<v Speaker 1>outer space.</v>

306
00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Look at this picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe electrified.</v>

307
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:59.370
<v Speaker 1>You can actually see the fruits of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of our efforts to create electricity,</v>

308
00:20:59.741 --> 00:21:04.741
<v Speaker 1>to energize our lives in one picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing the earth from outer space.</v>

309
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 1>So let's now talk about how faraday and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Maxwell is,</v>

310
00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:13.660
<v Speaker 1>where it touches your life as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the Internet.</v>

311
00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:14.943
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is a simple byproduct of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the electromagnetic force and you can </v>

312
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 1>see that where there is the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's prosperity,</v>

313
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.250
<v Speaker 1>there is science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's entertainment,</v>

314
00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.130
<v Speaker 1>there's economic activity where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>no internet,</v>

315
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:28.353
<v Speaker 1>there's poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the future the Urjanet will be </v>

316
00:21:32.171 --> 00:21:34.750
<v Speaker 1>miniaturized and it'll be placed in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses.</v>

317
00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:35.973
<v Speaker 1>Your glasses will recognize people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>faces and display their biography next </v>

318
00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:44.350
<v Speaker 1>to the image as you talked to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when they speak Chinese to you,</v>

319
00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.333
<v Speaker 1>your glasses will translate Chinese into</v>
<v Speaker 1>English and out subtitles right beneath </v>

320
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:51.484
<v Speaker 1>their image.</v>

321
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:52.443
<v Speaker 1>So in the future you will know exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are talking to without even </v>

322
00:21:56.380 --> 00:22:00.160
<v Speaker 1>talking to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this means that at a cocktail party,</v>

323
00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.293
<v Speaker 1>if you're looking for a job but you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know who the heavy hitters are in </v>

324
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:04.924
<v Speaker 1>the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will know exactly who to suck up to </v>

325
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.140
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At chips,</v>

326
00:22:09.141 --> 00:22:09.974
<v Speaker 1>all in cost a penny because we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacture a tinier and tinier </v>

327
00:22:13.841 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 1>transistors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will have ferritin's electromagnetic</v>

328
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:20.590
<v Speaker 1>forest inside your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pill,</v>

329
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:22.023
<v Speaker 1>it has a chip in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chip is smaller than an aspirin </v>

330
00:22:24.491 --> 00:22:27.700
<v Speaker 1>pill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also has a TV camera and a magnet.</v>

331
00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:28.893
<v Speaker 1>When you swallow it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the magnet guides the camera taking </v>

332
00:22:32.201 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Speaker 1>pictures of your stomach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your intestines,</v>

333
00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:38.590
<v Speaker 1>because we all know what middle aged men</v>
<v Speaker 1>feared the most colonoscopies,</v>

334
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:43.960
<v Speaker 1>and this gives new meaning for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>expression Intel inside.</v>

335
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.903
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about the next great forces </v>

336
00:22:49.731 --> 00:22:52.700
<v Speaker 1>which ruled the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about gravity,</v>

337
00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.640
<v Speaker 1>which allows us to calculate the motion </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planets,</v>

338
00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.710
<v Speaker 1>the mechanics created by Newton help to </v>
<v Speaker 1>unleash the industrial revolution.</v>

339
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Michael Faraday worked out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic force,</v>

340
00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.100
<v Speaker 1>which gave us the wonders of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric age,</v>

341
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:10.000
<v Speaker 1>and now let's talk about the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>age.</v>

342
00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:15.550
<v Speaker 1>The stars and the Sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been fascinated by the sun.</v>

343
00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Apollo was the God that strode across </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavens and his fiery chariot,</v>

344
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:22.543
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you calculate how long coal or oil </v>

345
00:23:26.661 --> 00:23:27.494
<v Speaker 1>will burn like the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize that and just a few hundred </v>

346
00:23:29.931 --> 00:23:32.450
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun would burn to a Chris.</v>

347
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.200
<v Speaker 1>So what could possibly last for billions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years?</v>

348
00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:40.640
<v Speaker 1>There must be a new force on nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>forests.</v>

349
00:23:41.900 --> 00:23:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Einstein and others helped to unravel </v>
<v Speaker 1>the secrets of the stars.</v>

350
00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.290
<v Speaker 1>The nuclear forest comes in two types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weak and strong.</v>

351
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.040
<v Speaker 1>The weak nuclear force governs </v>
<v Speaker 1>radioactive decay.</v>

352
00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.410
<v Speaker 1>The strong nuclear force is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongest forces in the entire universe.</v>

353
00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.880
<v Speaker 1>It's so strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It holds our protons together ever since</v>

354
00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:05.773
<v Speaker 1>genesis the beginning of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The equation which allows for the </v>

355
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:14.921
<v Speaker 1>liberation of energy is Einstein's </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous equation e equals MC squared.</v>

356
00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:20.240
<v Speaker 1>What Einstein showed was that the faster</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move,</v>

357
00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the heavier you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your weight is not a constant.</v>

358
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:27.200
<v Speaker 1>When you move very rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get heavier.</v>

359
00:24:27.260 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 1>Something which we measure every day in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the laboratory.</v>

360
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:30.853
<v Speaker 1>Now this means that the energy of motion</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed into mass because you get </v>

361
00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:40.520
<v Speaker 1>heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now listen carefully.</v>

362
00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 1>The faster you move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavier you get,</v>

363
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 1>which means the energy of motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He turns into Em.</v>

364
00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Your mass and the relationship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Enm is assembled.</v>

365
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.440
<v Speaker 1>It takes one second to write it down on </v>
<v Speaker 1>a sheet of paper.</v>

366
00:24:57.670 --> 00:25:02.670
<v Speaker 1>It is exactly e equals Mc Square,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the nuclear forests helped to explain</v>

367
00:25:05.091 --> 00:25:05.924
<v Speaker 1>the secret of the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also created a Pandora's box </v>

368
00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:10.693
<v Speaker 1>because inside the nucleus of the Adam </v>
<v Speaker 1>are particles and when you smash these </v>

369
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:17.720
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you get?</v>

370
00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:22.070
<v Speaker 1>More particles and when you smash them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when do you get more particles?</v>

371
00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.240
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are drowning in subatomic particles.</v>

372
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.780
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of subatomic particles.</v>

373
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.823
<v Speaker 1>Every time we smash atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we smash atoms using something </v>

374
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:37.220
<v Speaker 1>called Atom smashers or particle </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerators.</v>

375
00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.760
<v Speaker 1>I built my own particle accelerator when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school.</v>

376
00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.390
<v Speaker 1>When I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to my mom one day and I said,</v>

377
00:25:44.391 --> 00:25:45.224
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I have permission to build a two </v>

378
00:25:47.031 --> 00:25:47.864
<v Speaker 1>point $3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion electron volt Beta particle </v>

379
00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 1>accelerator in the garage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mom said,</v>

380
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.730
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

381
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And don't forget to take out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>garbage.</v>

382
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.963
<v Speaker 1>So I went to Westinghouse and as a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>school kid I asked for 400 pounds of </v>

383
00:26:02.571 --> 00:26:03.404
<v Speaker 1>transformers steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked for 22 miles of copper wire </v>

384
00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 1>because I wanted to create a six </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilowatt,</v>

385
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.343
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas magnetic field to energize my atom </v>

386
00:26:11.181 --> 00:26:13.850
<v Speaker 1>smasher with 22 miles of copper wire.</v>

387
00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:14.683
<v Speaker 1>How could you wind it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did it on the high school football </v>

388
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:17.414
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put 22 miles of copper wire and the </v>

389
00:26:19.341 --> 00:26:23.930
<v Speaker 1>goalpost gave it to my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ran to the 50 yard line,</v>

390
00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:28.460
<v Speaker 1>unraveling the spool of wire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She gave it to my father who then ran to</v>

391
00:26:28.461 --> 00:26:29.294
<v Speaker 1>the goalpost and we wound 22 miles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>copper wire on the high school football </v>

392
00:26:33.081 --> 00:26:34.280
<v Speaker 1>field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

393
00:26:34.281 --> 00:26:38.900
<v Speaker 1>finally my atom smasher was ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can sub six kilowatts of power.</v>

394
00:26:38.901 --> 00:26:42.830
<v Speaker 1>That's every single ounce of power that </v>
<v Speaker 1>my house could deliver.</v>

395
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I plug my ears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I close my eyes.</v>

396
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:52.731
<v Speaker 1>I turned on the power and I heard this </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge crackling sound as six kilowatts of</v>

397
00:26:53.671 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 1>power surge through my capacitor bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I heard a pop pop,</v>

398
00:26:58.651 --> 00:26:59.484
<v Speaker 1>pop sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I blew out every single circuit </v>

399
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:06.150
<v Speaker 1>breaker in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole house was plunged in darkness.</v>

400
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:07.823
<v Speaker 1>My poor mom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time she come home she would see </v>

401
00:27:10.331 --> 00:27:14.130
<v Speaker 1>the lights flicker and die and she must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have wondered,</v>

402
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:17.670
<v Speaker 1>why couldn't I have a son who plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball?</v>

403
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Why can't he learn basketball and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>God's sake,</v>

404
00:27:21.121 --> 00:27:23.430
<v Speaker 1>why can't you find a nice Japanese girl?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

405
00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.480
<v Speaker 1>why does he have to build these machines</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the garage?</v>

406
00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these machines that I built in my garage</v>

407
00:27:31.111 --> 00:27:34.560
<v Speaker 1>earn the attention of a physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Edward Teller,</v>

408
00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.573
<v Speaker 1>father of the hydrogen bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he arranged for me to get a </v>

409
00:27:38.461 --> 00:27:42.090
<v Speaker 1>scholarship to Harvard and my career got</v>
<v Speaker 1>a headstart.</v>

410
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.193
<v Speaker 1>He knew exactly what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to explain to him that I </v>

411
00:27:46.951 --> 00:27:47.784
<v Speaker 1>was experimenting with anti matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was creating anti electrons and my </v>

412
00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:52.134
<v Speaker 1>mom's garage and using atis measures to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually create beams of anti matter </v>

413
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.200
<v Speaker 1>and matter is the opposite of matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has the opposite charge,</v>

414
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.273
<v Speaker 1>so an electron has negative charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The positron or anti electron has </v>

415
00:28:05.941 --> 00:28:06.774
<v Speaker 1>positive charge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that you cannot create anti </v>

416
00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:14.580
<v Speaker 1>molecules and anti Adams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti hydrogen was made at Cern,</v>

417
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.960
<v Speaker 1>outside Geneva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

418
00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:17.003
<v Speaker 1>and also at fermilab outside Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 1>where have anti electrons circulating </v>

419
00:28:21.271 --> 00:28:25.410
<v Speaker 1>around antiprotons and in Brookhaven </v>
<v Speaker 1>national laboratory,</v>

420
00:28:25.411 --> 00:28:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Long Island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just recently,</v>

421
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:27.953
<v Speaker 1>they detected anti helium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have two antiprotons with two anti </v>

422
00:28:32.821 --> 00:28:37.560
<v Speaker 1>neutrons to create anti helium for every</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of matter.</v>

423
00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.530
<v Speaker 1>There's a counterpart which is made out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of antiemetic,</v>

424
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.510
<v Speaker 1>and when the two collide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

425
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 1>that releases the greatest energy source</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the universe,</v>

426
00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:52.540
<v Speaker 1>it is 100 percent conversion of matter </v>
<v Speaker 1>to energy by Einstein's equations.</v>

427
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.480
<v Speaker 1>E equals MC squared.</v>

428
00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.033
<v Speaker 1>Inside the nucleus of the atom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have particles upon particles when </v>

429
00:29:03.211 --> 00:29:05.820
<v Speaker 1>you smashed them apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 19 fifties,</v>

430
00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.900
<v Speaker 1>we were drowning in subatomic particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

431
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.720
<v Speaker 1>J dot Robert Oppenheimer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the father of the atomic bomb,</v>

432
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.823
<v Speaker 1>once made a statement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he declared that the Nobel Prize in </v>

433
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:19.734
<v Speaker 1>physics should go to the physicist who </v>
<v Speaker 1>does not discover a new particle this </v>

434
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:25.380
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

435
00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.330
<v Speaker 2>That's how many particles were being </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovered.</v>

436
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:31.190
<v Speaker 2>So let's talk about the particles zoo.</v>

437
00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Right now we've physicists have unlocked</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>

438
00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:38.003
<v Speaker 1>thousands of subatomic particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've been able to piece them </v>

439
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:41.364
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A jigsaw puzzle is called the standard </v>

440
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:46.450
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has 36 quarks,</v>

441
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>19 free parameters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three generations of Clarks,</v>

442
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 1>no rhyme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason,</v>

443
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:58.290
<v Speaker 1>but this is the most fundamental basis </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reality that we've.</v>

444
00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Businesses have been able to construct </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars,</v>

445
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:08.190
<v Speaker 1>20 Nobel prizes have gone into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>creation of the standard model and it is</v>

446
00:30:08.831 --> 00:30:13.270
<v Speaker 1>the ugliest theory known to science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it works.</v>

447
00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:18.160
<v Speaker 1>There's one piece missing and that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece that's missing is called the Higgs</v>

448
00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.200
<v Speaker 1>Boson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We expect to find it.</v>

449
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:21.603
<v Speaker 1>We want to create a higher version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this theory and that theory we think is </v>

450
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:28.564
<v Speaker 1>string theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>String theory is based on the simple </v>

451
00:30:31.211 --> 00:30:35.710
<v Speaker 1>idea that all the four forces of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

452
00:30:36.010 --> 00:30:38.650
<v Speaker 1>gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic force,</v>

453
00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.730
<v Speaker 1>and the two nuclear forces can be viewed</v>
<v Speaker 1>as music.</v>

454
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:44.613
<v Speaker 1>Music of tiny little rubber bands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I had a supermarket scope and I </v>

455
00:30:48.761 --> 00:30:51.670
<v Speaker 1>could look right into the heart of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>electron,</v>

456
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.863
<v Speaker 1>what would I see?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would see a vibrating rubber band and </v>

457
00:30:55.481 --> 00:30:57.490
<v Speaker 1>if I trying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a neutrino.</v>

458
00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.700
<v Speaker 1>I trying it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns into a court I trying and again</v>

459
00:31:00.701 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 1>turns into a Yang Mills particle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

460
00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:03.873
<v Speaker 1>by playing it enough times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get thousands of subatomic particles </v>

461
00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that have been catalog patiently by </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

462
00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.793
<v Speaker 1>String theory we think is a theory of </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything now in string theory in turn </v>

463
00:31:19.931 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 1>can be summarized in an equation about </v>
<v Speaker 1>an inch long.</v>

464
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.873
<v Speaker 1>That's my equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is called string field theory and </v>

465
00:31:28.031 --> 00:31:31.960
<v Speaker 1>how will we test it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are building a machine,</v>

466
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:33.573
<v Speaker 1>the biggest machine of science ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>built in the history of the human race </v>

467
00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:40.480
<v Speaker 1>outside Geneva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

468
00:31:41.050 --> 00:31:46.050
<v Speaker 1>It is the large Hadron collider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the Higgs Boson we think will be</v>

469
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:52.120
<v Speaker 1>created by the large hadron collider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tube 17 miles.</v>

470
00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:52.973
<v Speaker 1>It's a conference with two beams of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protons circulating in opposite </v>

471
00:31:55.691 --> 00:31:58.630
<v Speaker 1>directions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then slamming together,</v>

472
00:31:59.080 --> 00:31:59.913
<v Speaker 1>creating a shower of particles and among</v>
<v Speaker 1>these particles we hope to find the </v>

473
00:32:04.091 --> 00:32:05.680
<v Speaker 1>expose on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

474
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:07.023
<v Speaker 1>we helped to find particles even beyond </v>
<v Speaker 1>the higgs on the next set of particles </v>

475
00:32:10.661 --> 00:32:11.494
<v Speaker 1>beyond the higgs on our spa articles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next layer of the jigsaw puzzle are </v>

476
00:32:15.371 --> 00:32:17.500
<v Speaker 1>called particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super particles,</v>

477
00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:18.873
<v Speaker 1>nothing but higher vibrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher musical notes of a vibrating </v>

478
00:32:22.421 --> 00:32:24.580
<v Speaker 1>string,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what else could we do?</v>

479
00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:27.850
<v Speaker 1>We can also unlock the secrets of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Bang.</v>

480
00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:29.403
<v Speaker 1>You see Einstein's equations breakdown </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the instant of the Big Bang and the </v>

481
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:34.564
<v Speaker 1>center of a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two most interesting places in the </v>

482
00:32:37.721 --> 00:32:42.721
<v Speaker 1>universe are beyond our reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using Einstein's equations.</v>

483
00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:47.420
<v Speaker 1>We need a higher theory and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 1>a string theory comes in.</v>

484
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:52.840
<v Speaker 1>String theory takes you before the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>bang before genesis itself,</v>

485
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:54.823
<v Speaker 1>and what is string theory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say it says that there is a multiverse </v>

486
00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:00.830
<v Speaker 1>of universities.</v>

487
00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:04.830
<v Speaker 1>Where did the Big Bang come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

488
00:33:04.831 --> 00:33:05.664
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's equations give us this </v>
<v Speaker 1>compelling picture that we are like </v>

489
00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:13.960
<v Speaker 1>insects on a soap bubble as gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>softball,</v>

490
00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:18.600
<v Speaker 1>which is expanding and we are trapped </v>
<v Speaker 1>like flies on flypaper.</v>

491
00:33:18.601 --> 00:33:22.140
<v Speaker 1>We can escape the soap bubble and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the Big Bang theory.</v>

492
00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.113
<v Speaker 1>String theory says there should be other</v>
<v Speaker 1>bubbles out there in a multiverse of </v>

493
00:33:30.031 --> 00:33:32.700
<v Speaker 1>bubbles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When to universities collide,</v>

494
00:33:33.690 --> 00:33:38.220
<v Speaker 1>it can form another universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the universe splits in half,</v>

495
00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.290
<v Speaker 1>it can create two universes and that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>think is the big bang.</v>

496
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.903
<v Speaker 1>The Big Bang is caused either by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collision of universes or by the </v>

497
00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.010
<v Speaker 1>visioning of universities.</v>

498
00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:56.910
<v Speaker 1>If there are other dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are other universes,</v>

499
00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.810
<v Speaker 1>can we go between universes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

500
00:34:00.811 --> 00:34:03.240
<v Speaker 1>that of course is very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

501
00:34:03.290 --> 00:34:04.123
<v Speaker 1>ours at wonderland gives us a </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that maybe one day we might </v>

502
00:34:09.361 --> 00:34:10.194
<v Speaker 1>create a wormhole between universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a wormhole think of taking a </v>

503
00:34:17.491 --> 00:34:20.280
<v Speaker 1>sheet of paper and putting two dots on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

504
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The shortest distance between two points</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a straight line,</v>

505
00:34:24.930 --> 00:34:28.620
<v Speaker 1>but if I can fold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can follow that sheet of paper,</v>

506
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.550
<v Speaker 1>then perhaps I can create a shortcut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shortcut through space and time called</v>

507
00:34:35.881 --> 00:34:39.120
<v Speaker 1>a wormhole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a genuine solution of Einstein's</v>

508
00:34:39.121 --> 00:34:39.954
<v Speaker 1>equations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can actually see this in string </v>

509
00:34:42.061 --> 00:34:42.894
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is how practical is it to </v>

510
00:34:45.931 --> 00:34:48.810
<v Speaker 1>go through one of these things we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

511
00:34:48.870 --> 00:34:51.330
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a debate among businesses today,</v>

512
00:34:51.570 --> 00:34:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Hawking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many physicists are jumping into the </v>

513
00:34:54.061 --> 00:34:54.894
<v Speaker 1>game of trying to figure out whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's physically possible to go all the </v>

514
00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:00.564
<v Speaker 1>way through a wormhole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you could then you might be </v>

515
00:35:06.211 --> 00:35:07.044
<v Speaker 1>able to use this as a time machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the string theory is a theory of </v>

516
00:35:10.801 --> 00:35:14.690
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a theory of time and time.</v>

517
00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Machines are allowed in Einstein's </v>
<v Speaker 1>equations,</v>

518
00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:18.593
<v Speaker 1>but to build one is extremely difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Far more energy is required than a </v>

519
00:35:25.231 --> 00:35:27.300
<v Speaker 1>simple Delorean with potassium.</v>

520
00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:33.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trillions of years from now,</v>

521
00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the universe is going to get awfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>

522
00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 1>We think the universe headed for a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>freeze.</v>

523
00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:43.200
<v Speaker 1>All the stars will blank out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stars will cease to twinkle.</v>

524
00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.960
<v Speaker 1>The universe will be so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be very cold.</v>

525
00:35:47.170 --> 00:35:48.003
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all intelligent life in the universe </v>

526
00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:52.323
<v Speaker 1>must die.</v>

527
00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:58.250
<v Speaker 1>The laws of physics or a death warrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>to all intelligent life.</v>

528
00:35:59.130 --> 00:35:59.963
<v Speaker 1>There's only one way to escape the death</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the universe and that is leave the </v>

529
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:06.324
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are now of course entering the realm </v>

530
00:36:08.281 --> 00:36:11.670
<v Speaker 1>of science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least we now have equations.</v>

531
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:12.743
<v Speaker 1>The equations of string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will allow us to calculate if it </v>

532
00:36:16.021 --> 00:36:21.021
<v Speaker 1>is possible to go through a wormhole to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to another universe where it's warmer</v>

533
00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:22.913
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps we can start all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were to summarize the march of </v>

534
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:33.660
<v Speaker 1>physics over the last 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

535
00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:39.440
<v Speaker 1>it would be the distillation of the laws</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nature into four fundamental forces,</v>

536
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:42.930
<v Speaker 1>gravity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity and magnetism,</v>

537
00:36:43.110 --> 00:36:45.840
<v Speaker 1>and the two nuclear forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the question is,</v>

538
00:36:45.841 --> 00:36:46.674
<v Speaker 1>is there a fifth force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a forest beyond the forces that we can </v>

539
00:36:50.071 --> 00:36:53.070
<v Speaker 1>measure in the laboratory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe it or not,</v>

540
00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.933
<v Speaker 1>there are physicists who have actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked very carefully for the fifth </v>

541
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:57.144
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>

542
00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Some people think maybe it's psychic </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>

543
00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.050
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's telepathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's something called power.</v>

544
00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the power of the mind may be </v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

545
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:08.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a physicist.</v>

546
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:09.743
<v Speaker 1>We believe in testing theories to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that they are falsifiable and </v>

547
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 1>reproducible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to make sure that on demand,</v>

548
00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:22.290
<v Speaker 1>your theory works every single time </v>
<v Speaker 1>without exception,</v>

549
00:37:22.770 --> 00:37:26.370
<v Speaker 1>and if your theory fails one time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>

550
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:28.110
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's theory,</v>

551
00:37:28.111 --> 00:37:33.111
<v Speaker 1>half's has to work every single time </v>
<v Speaker 1>without exception one time.</v>

552
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Einstein's theory is proven to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole theory is wrong.</v>

553
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:38.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far we can reproduce these four </v>

554
00:37:40.021 --> 00:37:40.854
<v Speaker 1>physical theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at fifth theory cannot be </v>

555
00:37:43.081 --> 00:37:45.600
<v Speaker 1>reproduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've looked for it.</v>

556
00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:46.703
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that maybe a fifth for</v>
<v Speaker 1>is maybe short range like not over the </v>

557
00:37:50.131 --> 00:37:50.964
<v Speaker 1>nucleus of the atom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ranging over several feet and we </v>

558
00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:55.044
<v Speaker 1>can't find any.</v>

559
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:58.743
<v Speaker 1>We physicists in the last 10 years I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered a new energy source larger </v>

560
00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.073
<v Speaker 1>than the galaxy itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark energy realized that our universe </v>

561
00:38:09.431 --> 00:38:12.820
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>73 percent of our universe,</v>

562
00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:13.683
<v Speaker 1>the matter energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>73 percent is in the form of dark </v>

563
00:38:16.661 --> 00:38:18.580
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the energy of nothing.</v>

564
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:22.150
<v Speaker 1>That's what's blowing the galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 1>farther and farther apart.</v>

565
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:25.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the energy of the Big Bang </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

566
00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:28.840
<v Speaker 1>Kids asked the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the universe banged that,</v>

567
00:38:28.841 --> 00:38:31.900
<v Speaker 1>what made it bang?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is dark energy.</v>

568
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Seventy three percent of the universe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy is energy.</v>

569
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three percent is dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dark matter is invisible matter.</v>

570
00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:42.520
<v Speaker 1>If I held it in my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would go right through my hand.</v>

571
00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.653
<v Speaker 1>It holds the galaxy together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty three percent of the universe is </v>

572
00:38:46.841 --> 00:38:47.674
<v Speaker 1>dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stars made out of hydrogen and helium </v>

573
00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.190
<v Speaker 1>make up four percent of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what about us?</v>

574
00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:58.330
<v Speaker 1>We the higher elements we made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen,</v>

575
00:38:58.331 --> 00:38:59.650
<v Speaker 1>carbon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nitrogen,</v>

576
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.860
<v Speaker 1>constant iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make a point,</v>

577
00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:06.580
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three percent of the universe.</v>

578
00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.700
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the exception.</v>

579
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.180
<v Speaker 1>The universe is mainly made out of dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

580
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.880
<v Speaker 1>The universe is mainly made out of dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

581
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Overwhelming the stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming the galaxies.</v>

582
00:39:19.271 --> 00:39:20.104
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now what is dark matter which makes up </v>

583
00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 1>23 percent of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

584
00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.820
<v Speaker 1>String theory gives us a clue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no definitive answer.</v>

585
00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.453
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you young aspiring businesses out </v>

586
00:39:37.191 --> 00:39:40.730
<v Speaker 1>there in the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may be saying to yourself right now,</v>

587
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:41.743
<v Speaker 1>why should I go into physics?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you guys already have a </v>

588
00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.980
<v Speaker 1>candidate for the unified field theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

589
00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Just realize that every single physics </v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook is wrong.</v>

590
00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.293
<v Speaker 1>Every single physics textbook on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth says that the universe is mainly </v>

591
00:39:55.731 --> 00:39:57.230
<v Speaker 1>made out of atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

592
00:39:57.350 --> 00:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The universe is mainly made out of atoms</v>

593
00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:01.213
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the last 10 years we have come to </v>

594
00:40:03.531 --> 00:40:04.364
<v Speaker 1>the realization that most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is dark and there's a whole </v>

595
00:40:08.811 --> 00:40:09.644
<v Speaker 1>shelf full of Nobel prizes for the young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who can figure out the secret of </v>

596
00:40:16.041 --> 00:40:18.470
<v Speaker 1>dark matter and dark energy.</v>

597
00:40:20.530 --> 00:40:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Let me get some advice to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you are a young physicist,</v>

598
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:27.460
<v Speaker 1>perhaps just getting out of high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have dreams of being.</v>

599
00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 1>Einstein have dreams of working on </v>
<v Speaker 1>string theory and stuff like that,</v>

600
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.020
<v Speaker 1>and then you hit freshman physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me be blunt.</v>

601
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:36.663
<v Speaker 1>We physicists flunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most students taking elementary physics </v>

602
00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:43.420
<v Speaker 1>and we're more or less encouraged to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>so by the engineering department.</v>

603
00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:47.710
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to train engineers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>make bridges that fall down.</v>

604
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.550
<v Speaker 1>We don't want to create engineers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>create skyscrapers that fall over.</v>

605
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:55.690
<v Speaker 1>There's a bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to know the laws of mechanics,</v>

606
00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 1>so before you can work with the laws of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein,</v>

607
00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to look with the laws of </v>
<v Speaker 1>friction,</v>

608
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:01.300
<v Speaker 1>levers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulleys,</v>

609
00:41:01.301 --> 00:41:03.490
<v Speaker 1>and gears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence,</v>

610
00:41:03.491 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 1>we have a very high flood God right in </v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary physics,</v>

611
00:41:06.310 --> 00:41:07.143
<v Speaker 1>so if you're a young physicist </v>
<v Speaker 1>graduating from high school with stars </v>

612
00:41:09.821 --> 00:41:13.810
<v Speaker 1>in your eyes and you encounter freshmen </v>
<v Speaker 1>physics for the first time,</v>

613
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.950
<v Speaker 1>watch out if you have a rough time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way it is.</v>

614
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:22.420
<v Speaker 1>I started out my life as an experimental</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist.</v>

615
00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Then I went to Harvard and then I talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my advisor,</v>

616
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the world's greatest experimental</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist,</v>

617
00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:29.103
<v Speaker 1>professor pound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he told me that maybe it's time to </v>

618
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:33.740
<v Speaker 1>give it a rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said to me,</v>

619
00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:37.610
<v Speaker 1>your skills are much better suited to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what you love the most,</v>

620
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.010
<v Speaker 1>which is theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics,</v>

621
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:40.873
<v Speaker 1>the world of higher dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I realized that he was probably </v>

622
00:41:43.941 --> 00:41:44.774
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing about physics or even science </v>

623
00:41:47.811 --> 00:41:48.644
<v Speaker 1>that really intrigues me the most is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find the most fundamental basis for </v>

624
00:41:53.091 --> 00:41:53.924
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than trying to massage a theory </v>

625
00:41:56.421 --> 00:42:00.230
<v Speaker 1>or make a theory prettier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not find out why it works,</v>

626
00:42:00.231 --> 00:42:03.140
<v Speaker 1>what makes it tick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so what I do for a living,</v>

627
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm a theoretical physicist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>
