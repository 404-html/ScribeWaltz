00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>My first job was one when I was still a</v>
<v Speaker 1>college student.</v>

2
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was an officer,</v>

3
00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.400
<v Speaker 1>a young father the first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if my age contributed to my,</v>

5
00:00:21.141 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a terror,</v>

6
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something might ever happen to</v>

7
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>this child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but having children in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having them be such a presence in my</v>

10
00:00:35.601 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>life for as long as they have been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that boy was born when I was 22.</v>

12
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm 67 now and my 18 year old still</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives under my roof in,</v>

13
00:00:49.941 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>in my house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.010
<v Speaker 1>for another year before he's off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>university.</v>

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

16
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a long time,</v>

17
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the age of 22 to 67,</v>

18
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have had one or more of my children</v>

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>living at home with me for all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

20
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It certainly has informed what I write</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how childhood and adolescence,</v>

21
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in 10 out of 12 of my novels.</v>

22
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Such,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vital part of the story.</v>

24
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I suppose it would surprise no one to</v>

25
00:01:34.821 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 1>think that my principal anxieties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.260
<v Speaker 1>in my real life or parental,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their anxieties,</v>

27
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for my children and by extension now for</v>

28
00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>my grandchildren and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 1>and for my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for it,</v>

30
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

31
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:55.431
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

32
00:01:55.431 --> 00:01:58.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a natural worrier.</v>

33
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what I do for a living.</v>

34
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>I create characters that I'm very fond</v>
<v Speaker 1>of and visited upon them.</v>

35
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>The worst things I can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's as you might well understand it,</v>

36
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to do that when you leave</v>

37
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>your office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the opportunity to stick</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination under your desk and say</v>

39
00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:24.770
<v Speaker 1>hello to it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the next morning it comes with you</v>

40
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.440
<v Speaker 1>write it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes where you go.</v>

41
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so with three children and four</v>

42
00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot to worry about,</v>

43
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I turned my attention to the</v>

44
00:02:38.751 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>state of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

45
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not that that leaves me an</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely,</v>

46
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:46.454
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 1>at ease either.</v>
