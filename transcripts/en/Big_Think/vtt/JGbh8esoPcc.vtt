00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>George clooney is like the gold standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>or for class and dignity and he gets it.</v>

2
00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>He once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my famous is my currency,</v>

3
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 1>and he uses that for causes that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to him.</v>

4
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>I think Brad and Angelina are pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>remarkable in the way they've managed</v>

5
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>their family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their public image.</v>

6
00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madonna is just amazing in her ability</v>

7
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>to remain relevant for a very long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

8
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>I look at celebrities having been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood more than 20 years and</v>

9
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>following it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people are famous for their</v>

10
00:00:43.061 --> 00:00:46.630
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people who are still relevant 20</v>

11
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:48.280
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me that's.</v>

12
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty darn impressive.</v>

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.850
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of these corporate ceos</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in a different world.</v>

14
00:00:58.851 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>They live in a world of multimillion</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar bonuses.</v>

15
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:07.541
<v Speaker 1>They live in a world of private jets and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the mill you they live in and I</v>

16
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>think the auto companies got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

17
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>they had a misstep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got it.</v>

18
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 1>They drove back to Washington the second</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and look what happened.</v>

19
00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>They got a deal out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a lot of.</v>

20
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.880
<v Speaker 1>They require people and people liked me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just because somebody is a CEO of a</v>

21
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to tell them the truth.</v>

22
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>I need to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not playing this right or this</v>

23
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:36.140
<v Speaker 1>isn't going to work right now for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and whether they choose to</v>

24
00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:39.620
<v Speaker 1>listen or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at it as a responsibility of mine</v>

25
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>to deal in reality because if I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them and they go out,</v>

26
00:01:44.151 --> 00:01:46.010
<v Speaker 1>they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you tell me?</v>

27
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>If I do tell them and they still choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it,</v>

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe they listen next time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who don't care about</v>

29
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use the.</v>

30
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I used the example of former vice</v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

31
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:01.550
<v Speaker 1>Dick Cheney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He.</v>

32
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>He knows people don't really like him</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

33
00:02:05.721 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 1>His poll numbers are down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he figures,</v>

34
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>screw you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the.</v>

35
00:02:10.281 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I was the vice president of United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

36
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I had all the power I wanted and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond caring about what my public</v>

37
00:02:16.521 --> 00:02:19.460
<v Speaker 1>images and he somebody who transcended</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

38
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.970
<v Speaker 1>We look at somebody like Ann Coulter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political pundant,</v>

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.670
<v Speaker 1>and she likes to be intentionally</v>
<v Speaker 1>provocative.</v>

40
00:02:25.671 --> 00:02:30.020
<v Speaker 1>She likes to say words that will upset</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shocked people.</v>

41
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>The n word and the f word and get the</v>
<v Speaker 1>press and then doesn't care because she</v>

42
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:38.360
<v Speaker 1>believes that all press is good press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not something I necessarily</v>

43
00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:39.830
<v Speaker 1>believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

44
00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>that's one of my core beliefs that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all press is good press,</v>

45
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but most people who are in the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>eye,</v>

46
00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>they have earned it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Yoko Ono's tired of it after all</v>

47
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

48
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>unless she does something pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant or makes an appearance in</v>

49
00:02:57.441 --> 00:03:01.040
<v Speaker 1>what you're not going to see about her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people have to do a little</v>

50
00:03:01.041 --> 00:03:03.140
<v Speaker 1>something to keep their interest going</v>
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>

51
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
