1
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's different,</v>

2
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult for me to compare it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Pushkin's time.</v>

3
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 1>My brother compared to with 60 s of last</v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

4
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>a 20th century because in that time</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in Russia wasn't,</v>

5
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>I would say itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe those have,</v>

6
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your readers,</v>

7
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the audience who read in</v>

8
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they remember,</v>

9
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this fabulous line by you have to</v>

10
00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:57.121
<v Speaker 1>shrink a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a point in Russia is more than a point</v>

11
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>or the point and either buy it or I see</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

12
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I remember that generations were</v>

13
00:01:05.871 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>fascinated with these more with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

14
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.630
<v Speaker 1>but in a sense it's quite silly because</v>
<v Speaker 1>a carrot than Russia more than a</v>

15
00:01:14.631 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 1>character or an Dunno our bread and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia more than Brad and star in Russia</v>

16
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>more than the star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so,</v>

17
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:25.991
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today poetry is not more than poetry</v>

18
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:31.211
<v Speaker 1>should be probably first period during</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole Russian history when poetry</v>

19
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.080
<v Speaker 1>occupies its own place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White models.</v>

20
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 1>I Degas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.520
<v Speaker 1>like in a different culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

22
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.810
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>from an point of view,</v>

23
00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:52.811
<v Speaker 1>it's normal because point a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it appoints,</v>

24
00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>stands on the stadium and the crowds</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouting,</v>

25
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>shout like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

26
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>They see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at the gladiator.</v>

27
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's a strange situation because</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not</v>

28
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>was because poetry today shouldn't bears</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

29
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>not it's own load.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't,</v>

30
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't substitute</v>

31
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.990
<v Speaker 1>free newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>as it could be free in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't.</v>

33
00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>How to it entertained people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't,</v>

34
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.173
<v Speaker 2>it shouldn't</v>

35
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.060
<v Speaker 1>talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

36
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something's not illegal,</v>

37
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>but something for beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

38
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.300
<v Speaker 1>it has to do its own job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then lane aim go.</v>

39
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of poetry is</v>

40
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.730
<v Speaker 1>to figure out what poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ece in practical way</v>

41
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.870
<v Speaker 1>it is searching of the language always</v>
<v Speaker 1>each,</v>

42
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 1>each poetry or in progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

43
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.550
<v Speaker 1>which pull each bullet point is working</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it is part of this general and quite</v>

44
00:03:48.471 --> 00:03:53.471
<v Speaker 1>ambitious a search of the language which</v>
<v Speaker 1>give may be in,</v>

45
00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 1>in case of success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

46
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.450
<v Speaker 1>and this could give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they put him herself and to the old</v>

47
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>audience possibility to be closer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.400
<v Speaker 1>understanding or suggestion what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

49
00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Describe the situation like these</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

50
00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

51
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.190
<v Speaker 1>today in today's Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the points are in so</v>

52
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>dangerous for those who keep powering</v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands.</v>

53
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is with one hand with the other hand,</v>

54
00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.900
<v Speaker 1>those who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>follower</v>

55
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 1>in their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they understand that the raw much more,</v>

56
00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>many of much more effective ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderation of their relationships with</v>

57
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.020
<v Speaker 1>people and people of art as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not so necessary to the</v>

58
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.760
<v Speaker 1>directress refresh represents to redress</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

59
00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.660
<v Speaker 1>So unfortunately I cannot answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly to your question as you asked</v>

60
00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think that,</v>

61
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poetry will in 10 or 15 years,</v>

62
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:51.841
<v Speaker 1>the poetry will be the only possibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see the truth to people know the</v>

63
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different institutions and a,</v>

64
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>not only poetry</v>

65
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 2>develops everything because.</v>
