1
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>A long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe three decades or so,</v>

2
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>kids are the ones who taught us to care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the environment.</v>

3
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>We as the adults were terribly wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were buying hardwoods.</v>

4
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>We weren't recycling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.980
<v Speaker 1>we were just dumping things in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rivers.</v>

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>We really didn't have an environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection agency that was worth</v>

7
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if we have one that's worth</v>

8
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>much today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have one and so we learned and we</v>

9
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>adjusted and so it is with really young</v>
<v Speaker 1>people today who were teaching us that</v>

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>animals deserve protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't things.</v>

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>They are fellows with us on the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we need to adjust our thinking</v>

12
00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>in the same way we did with</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmentalists,</v>

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>but it happens that it is all tied</v>
<v Speaker 1>together because the whole ecology of</v>

14
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:56.991
<v Speaker 1>the earth depends on so many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>species that intermix with their roles</v>

15
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and keeping the earth and the air and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the water's clean and healthful.</v>

16
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to some remote parts of</v>

17
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are very few of them left today,</v>

18
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>but you can and you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh look,</v>

19
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>it's uninhabited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pristine.</v>

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not uninhabited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inhabited by billions upon billions</v>

21
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>of creatures from the tiniest insect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolf,</v>

22
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>to the Eagle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the beaver.</v>

23
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>All these animals have lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've never heard their</v>

24
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>environment at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We come in with all bulldozers and our</v>

25
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>heavy equipment and our oil pipelines</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything else.</v>

26
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>We are leaking oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see from our ships,</v>

27
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.190
<v Speaker 1>we have causing the animals of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oceans to die because of the noises of</v>

28
00:01:39.361 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>drilling and what have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to learn that this isn't all</v>

29
00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>about us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are just ruining our own nest,</v>

30
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>so it is a big environmental movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the alignment between animal</v>

31
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:56.451
<v Speaker 1>rights and the environment should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute and that doesn't even count the</v>

32
00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing with our diet because</v>
<v Speaker 1>our diet is the most polluting water</v>

33
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:07.851
<v Speaker 1>intensive resource consuming an</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation that we have on earth.</v>

34
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>We are just deforesting take cutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>down the trees so we can make cheap</v>

35
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>grazing land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are pulling the water out of the</v>

36
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>earth so that we can grow crops and</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of eating the crops ourselves,</v>

37
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>we need 10 to 16 times as many crops to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feed to the animals who we ultimately</v>

38
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>take more water to slaughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transport,</v>

39
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is just a disaster.</v>

40
00:02:33.181 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>Animal based agriculture has got to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sooner or later it will because the</v>

41
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>water supply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

42
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>we'll run out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't think for a moment that animals</v>

43
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:47.871
<v Speaker 1>have more rights than human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we think is that human beings are</v>

44
00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:53.151
<v Speaker 1>clever enough and moral enough to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to the others on the face</v>

45
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So animals are never going to do the</v>

46
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>things we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any aunts who put down</v>

47
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>poison for human beings.</v>

48
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't know any squirrels who've</v>
<v Speaker 1>declared war in Iraq.</v>

49
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we uh,</v>

50
00:03:08.571 --> 00:03:09.950
<v Speaker 1>the great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>override as of everything we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the great decision makers about</v>

52
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have very,</v>

53
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>very destructive for the animals take</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their need.</v>

54
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.760
<v Speaker 1>And we take for our greed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>you could reconstruct flocks of birds</v>
<v Speaker 1>and herds of cattle from just the</v>

56
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>leftovers that are on the trees outside</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the car door of my hotel today,</v>

57
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>that there's animals didn't die for any</v>
<v Speaker 1>good purpose and they didn't die.</v>

58
00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they die because we fancied something</v>

59
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>and we ordered more than we could ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat.</v>

60
00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:43.710
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to be responsible and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter has a great hope that human beings</v>

61
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>can be more like grownups and like big</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

62
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:53.161
<v Speaker 1>greedy children and that we can look out</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the basic needs of animals,</v>

63
00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>which is leave me in peace.</v>

64
00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Don't hurt me when you don't have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose something that's kind instead of</v>

65
00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>something that's cruel live by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden rule of do unto others and</v>

66
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>include the animals too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

67
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 1>because there are billions upon</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions.</v>

68
00:04:10.211 --> 00:04:15.211
<v Speaker 1>Something like $16 billion animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed for food every year in this</v>

69
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.760
<v Speaker 1>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an awful lot of individuals and</v>

70
00:04:18.761 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe a $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million animals killed in awful ways and</v>

71
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 1>experiments every year and others use in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the circus and dissection in the</v>

72
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>clothing industry and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I opened the paper and I see an</v>

73
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>absence of coverage for all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>

74
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>then I feel that we have yet to wake up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a core part of what's going on in the</v>

75
00:04:42.371 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we are to self obsessed and we have</v>

76
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>to narrow in our consideration of who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>us now.</v>

77
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:53.350
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bumper sticker that says I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only different,</v>

78
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>and I couldn't see who was driving the</v>
<v Speaker 1>car turned and afterwards I thought,</v>

79
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>well actually it doesn't matter who is</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving,</v>

80
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a man or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>White,</v>

81
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese doesn't matter.</v>

82
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>And that was the message is that I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only different and all those</v>

83
00:05:07.901 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>billions of individuals and it took us a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time to even know that the people</v>

84
00:05:12.881 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>we institutionalized where individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people of other races were</v>

85
00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>individuals that slaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africans who were brought to this</v>

86
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't think of them as individuals.</v>

87
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>They weren't in the paper other than if</v>
<v Speaker 1>one ran away and we had to go and</v>

88
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>retrieve all possession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the absence of the coverage about all</v>

89
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:37.261
<v Speaker 1>the other animals who have interests is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest thing that hits me when I</v>

90
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:38.374
<v Speaker 1>watched the news or</v>

91
00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:39.010
<v Speaker 2>on the paper.</v>
