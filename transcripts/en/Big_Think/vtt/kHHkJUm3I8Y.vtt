1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I think we have tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous growth,</v>

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous potential in exploring the</v>

3
00:00:07.891 --> 00:00:11.850
<v Speaker 1>frontier of human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are at just at the very,</v>

4
00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:16.851
<v Speaker 1>very beginning of a very exciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>adventure and think of of diseases as</v>

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>common cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>But it's nothing terribly unusual about</v>
<v Speaker 1>common called right,</v>

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>yet we don't have a cure for common cold</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>

8
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of ironic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that innovation could be</v>

10
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.881
<v Speaker 1>very small for small things like common</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold or big things like Alzheimer's and</v>

11
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have multiple products for the</v>

12
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>diabetes today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have acute for diabetes yet.</v>

13
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you add Alzheimer's and diabetes,</v>

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>it could bankrupt our health care system</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet we don't have a cure for diabetes</v>

15
00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>and we don't know how to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's yet.</v>

16
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>So if I look at the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of things will happen.</v>

17
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have phenomenal tools that will</v>

18
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:11.061
<v Speaker 1>enable us to diagnose and to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific in better understanding the</v>

19
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>mechanism of virtually any disease.</v>

20
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>And the second aspect would be based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can start now charter the,</v>

21
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>the road to veteran understanding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

22
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.550
<v Speaker 1>We don't know much about the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know a few things here and there,</v>

23
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>but the brain is a huge unknown</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically still.</v>

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>We don't have a lot of tools yet to</v>
<v Speaker 1>better understand how we think the</v>

25
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>memory and everything related to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

26
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>so the brain will be probably the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontier,</v>

27
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but we should not forget that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>still about 6,000 rare diseases that do</v>

28
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>not have a treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have a lot of work to do and we</v>

29
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>cannot do it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean money and investment is one</v>

30
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need to continue working on the</v>

31
00:01:56.701 --> 00:02:01.701
<v Speaker 1>framework of the regulatory agencies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we can partner with the regulators</v>

32
00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>to have a clear path forward to having</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new drugs approved.</v>

33
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>The biggest challenge we face is science</v>
<v Speaker 1>is moving so fast that the regulators</v>

34
00:02:14.011 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>have to catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have to catch up to understand and</v>

35
00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:23.121
<v Speaker 1>catch up even more to regulate us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a very daunting challenge and I</v>

36
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.940
<v Speaker 1>really believe that the regulators are</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the right things in most of the</v>

37
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:33.150
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I can only see the</v>

38
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>challenges that they have to better</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand how the science is</v>

39
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:39.540
<v Speaker 1>progressing and you hear every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.110
<v Speaker 1>every day about the genomes and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the genomes.</v>

41
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is absolutely flabbergasting the</v>

42
00:02:45.751 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>progress we've made over the last 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years in better understanding the inner</v>

43
00:02:50.551 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>mechanics of how we work and from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will come.</v>

44
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>New Medications will come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new cures,</v>

45
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>new treatments.</v>
