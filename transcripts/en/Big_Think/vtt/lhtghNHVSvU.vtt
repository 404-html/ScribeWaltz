00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Presuasion is the process of arranging</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an audience to agree with your</v>

2
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>message before they encounter it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>that might sound like some form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic,</v>

4
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's established science.</v>

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Very often we can use priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waist live tactics,</v>

6
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>even other kinds of influence tactics on</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to increase the likelihood</v>

7
00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>that we will reach our goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we will obtain the outcomes that we</v>

8
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 1>hope for in a particular situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's research,</v>

9
00:00:37.041 --> 00:00:42.041
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show that if you depict for people an</v>

10
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>image of a runner winning a race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become more achievement oriented</v>

11
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 1>and actually achieved their goal to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater extent while that runner is in</v>

12
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another piece of research,</v>

13
00:00:57.591 --> 00:01:02.591
<v Speaker 1>a followup research that shows that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you depict for people an image of</v>

14
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Rodin's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinker,</v>

15
00:01:04.791 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>you know that the statute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become more analytic and</v>

16
00:01:09.171 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>deliberative and they're more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve problems,</v>

17
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 1>difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex problems that they're faced</v>

18
00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

19
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.090
<v Speaker 1>So this is something we can do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>

20
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>If we have a task that requires a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and motivation.</v>

21
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Put a picture of a runner winning a race</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the corner of your computer screen</v>

22
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>where you will see that cue there while</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're performing the task.</v>

23
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>If you're analyzing a budget perhaps or</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing some plan that requires a lot</v>

24
00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:46.661
<v Speaker 1>of strategic thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put a picture of the thinker there and</v>

25
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:51.770
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to achieve that</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular goal.</v>

26
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.830
<v Speaker 1>The thing is we get to control the cues</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our environment that send us in</v>

27
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:02.381
<v Speaker 1>directions that are likely to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful for the particular task we</v>

28
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:07.571
<v Speaker 1>have at hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When writing my book presuasion,</v>

29
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I dedicated it to my grandchildren and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was something I did for myself to</v>

30
00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:22.301
<v Speaker 1>pre swayed me to make that the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible book I could develop and</v>

31
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to put the following image in my</v>

32
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 1>mind of each of my grandchildren who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>young right now.</v>

33
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Here's the image.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they're old enough to read it,</v>

34
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I've left a copy with their parents for</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of them,</v>

35
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.950
<v Speaker 1>and I want their parents to give them</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book and say,</v>

36
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you see this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This book was dedicated to you.</v>

37
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Will it better be a good book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It better be the highest quality book I</v>

38
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>can arrange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so while I was writing that book,</v>

39
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.660
<v Speaker 1>there was a corner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a coroner,</v>

40
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 1>photograph of my grandkids on the screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my computer.</v>

41
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>That picture kept me focused on quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No short cuts allowed.</v>

42
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>This is for my grandkids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It better be the best book I can</v>

43
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.420
<v Speaker 1>possibly generate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first started investigating the</v>

44
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>influence process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually became a spy of sorts.</v>

45
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.790
<v Speaker 1>I went undercover to all of the major</v>
<v Speaker 1>professions of our society dedicated to</v>

46
00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>getting us to say yes and I took</v>
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

47
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I enrolled in the training programs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>salespeople,</v>

48
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>fundraisers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recruiters,</v>

49
00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.660
<v Speaker 1>public relations specialists and so on</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what were the techniques that</v>

50
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:06.391
<v Speaker 1>we're working most</v>
<v Speaker 1>widely across the range,</v>

51
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the broadest range of these influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategies of these influence approaches</v>

52
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>and what.</v>

53
00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.520
<v Speaker 1>What I found was interesting in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a particular kind of</v>

54
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:27.151
<v Speaker 1>practitioner within those influenced</v>
<v Speaker 1>professions who rose to the top.</v>

55
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Almost invariably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't the individual who spent most</v>

56
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.440
<v Speaker 1>of his or her time crafting the message</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they sent.</v>

57
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Although that was important to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was that they crafted what they said</v>

58
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.630
<v Speaker 1>and did immediately before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivered their message.</v>

59
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.930
<v Speaker 1>That was the differentiator between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>average scores and the aces of each</v>

60
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people who were the highest</v>

61
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.950
<v Speaker 1>achievers were priests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waders,</v>

62
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they acted like expert gardeners.</v>

63
00:05:11.891 --> 00:05:16.891
<v Speaker 1>They knew that it didn't matter how good</v>
<v Speaker 1>this seed that you had might be if you</v>

64
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:24.961
<v Speaker 1>didn't prepare the earth for it first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't going to bear fullest fruit.</v>

65
00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>So they cultivated the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

66
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.570
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pretreated the ground,</v>

67
00:05:34.571 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>and before they planted their seed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>their message,</v>

68
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 1>they did something that caused the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recipients of their message to have a</v>

69
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:49.921
<v Speaker 1>positive state of mind before they</v>
<v Speaker 1>encountered the message itself.</v>

70
00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.170
<v Speaker 1>The interesting question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you go about cultivating the</v>

71
00:05:56.171 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>earth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you arrange for people to be in a</v>

72
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>frame of mind that is conducive to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.940
<v Speaker 1>the message that you wanted to send?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>it is to recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

75
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.830
<v Speaker 1>what is the central element of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>message?</v>

76
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.410
<v Speaker 1>What is the feature of your message that</v>
<v Speaker 1>would make it most wise for people to</v>

77
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>accept your offer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

78
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:34.030
<v Speaker 1>And then you take that dimension and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the moment before you deliver your</v>

79
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:40.271
<v Speaker 1>message and give draw people's attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that idea,</v>

80
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>to that dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

81
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>There was a study done by an online</v>
<v Speaker 1>furniture store.</v>

82
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:52.870
<v Speaker 1>They had a furniture that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable.</v>

83
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 1>They also had lower and furniture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was attractive because it was</v>

84
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.790
<v Speaker 1>inexpensive and they did an experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send half of the visitors to their</v>

85
00:07:04.731 --> 00:07:09.731
<v Speaker 1>site to a background depiction of clouds</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the landing page of a wallpaper of</v>

86
00:07:17.871 --> 00:07:18.420
<v Speaker 1>their site.</v>

87
00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So the landing page had fluffy clouds on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the back background.</v>

88
00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Those people read it comfort as the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important factor in buying a sofa.</v>

89
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
<v Speaker 1>They spent more time searching for</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfort related information inside the</v>

90
00:07:42.471 --> 00:07:47.471
<v Speaker 1>site and they preferred comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>furniture to purchase.</v>

91
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.890
<v Speaker 1>The other half of the visitors were sent</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a site that had as its background,</v>

92
00:07:55.761 --> 00:07:58.670
<v Speaker 1>wallpaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pennies,</v>

93
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 1>coins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

94
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people rated cost as the most</v>

95
00:08:06.291 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 1>important feature for them for</v>
<v Speaker 1>purchasing a sofa.</v>

96
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.640
<v Speaker 1>They searched for price related</v>
<v Speaker 1>information and they purchased more</v>

97
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.820
<v Speaker 1>inexpensive furniture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They preferred to purchase more</v>

98
00:08:19.821 --> 00:08:24.821
<v Speaker 1>inexpensive furniture as a consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see that what was the central</v>

99
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.520
<v Speaker 1>dimension of the message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be comfort or it could be cost,</v>

100
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:39.580
<v Speaker 1>could be installed in a customer's mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of time,</v>

101
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>which caused them to see that dimension</v>
<v Speaker 1>as more important,</v>

102
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.380
<v Speaker 1>to search for information relative to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to act on the basis of a product</v>

103
00:08:52.251 --> 00:08:56.940
<v Speaker 1>that gave them that dimension in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prioritized way.</v>

104
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It could be cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be clouds.</v>

105
00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>Here was the interesting thing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that study.</v>

106
00:09:01.951 --> 00:09:06.951
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost no one recognized that they had</v>

107
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>been influenced by the background</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallpaper.</v>

108
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It flew under the radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that this is something that's</v>

109
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:23.421
<v Speaker 1>not only powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also something that we have to deal</v>

110
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:28.440
<v Speaker 1>with in a as as as communicators in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical way,</v>

111
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 1>because we've got some things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to move people in our direction</v>

112
00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:38.270
<v Speaker 1>without them even recognizing or taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>into account that we're moving them in</v>

113
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

114
00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.010
<v Speaker 1>in their direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our direction.</v>
