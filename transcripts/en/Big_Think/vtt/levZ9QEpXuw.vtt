00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Big Data is not an unmitigated good like</v>
<v Speaker 1>many things in society,</v>

2
00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:05.680
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably all things,</v>

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.610
<v Speaker 1>it comes with risks as well and it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a dark side and one dark side of</v>

4
00:00:09.611 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>course is privacy that exists today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll exist tomorrow.</v>

5
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it gets bigger with big data as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.000
<v Speaker 1>but there is something else to play for</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else that's a little bit more</v>

7
00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>troubling still and that is if you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>propensity it,</v>

8
00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>is big data algorithms making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prediction of what you are likely to do</v>

9
00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>before you've actually done it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the criminal justice system has</v>

10
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>never really dealt with this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem before.</v>

11
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Typically you have to commit a crime</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you were penalized for that</v>

12
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:40.690
<v Speaker 1>crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if it is simply a prediction</v>

13
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>that you have a likelihood of committing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crime?</v>

14
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Would society be remiss not to</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene?</v>

15
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>If I could tell with a 98 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>statistical accuracy that you are likely</v>

16
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>to shoplift in the next 12 months?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public Safety requires that I interact</v>

17
00:00:57.221 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and maybe I don't put you into jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not minority report.</v>

18
00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>It's not pre crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a social worker knock on your</v>

19
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>door and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to help you.</v>

20
00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:09.040
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to get you an afterschool job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a teenager,</v>

21
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to sort of support you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like it's a benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in reality,</v>

23
00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is going to be stigmatized</v>

24
00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>in the eye of his peers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school teachers,</v>

25
00:01:20.651 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

26
00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>he'll probably feel stigmatized in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>own eyes and feel badly,</v>

27
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:28.210
<v Speaker 1>and we might even encourage the tort</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of behavior that we want to</v>

28
00:01:28.211 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 1>prevent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is that he will have been a</v>

29
00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 1>victim of a prediction about him and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>could rightly say,</v>

30
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>I will be the two percent that will not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shoplift that I'll exercise my moral</v>

31
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the solution seems to be in a big</v>

32
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>data world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to send how sanctify the notion</v>

33
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:50.641
<v Speaker 1>of the human volition of human free will</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to preserve that as a central</v>

34
00:01:50.921 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 1>attribute.</v>
