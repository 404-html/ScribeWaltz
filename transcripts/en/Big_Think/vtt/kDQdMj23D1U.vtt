1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 2>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 2>Jews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jewish Egyptians were very,</v>

4
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 2>very accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The very prominent,</v>

5
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 2>and I will give you some quick examples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the assistant of our Greek leader of</v>

6
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:33.351
<v Speaker 2>1990 revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sadza who was our group leader who made</v>

7
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 2>the revolution against the British</v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation.</v>

8
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.600
<v Speaker 2>His assistant was Jewish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptian,</v>

9
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the founders of the Egyptian</v>

10
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>economies war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 2>and that was our way to fight back</v>
<v Speaker 2>against the,</v>

12
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.330
<v Speaker 2>the English occupation to have our own</v>
<v Speaker 2>university and our own economy and our</v>

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 2>own banks and the were Jewish families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 2>it was even some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the very,</v>

15
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:09.471
<v Speaker 2>very famous movie stars in Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The forties were Jews you see at the,</v>

16
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 2>it was not even accepted to identify</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians according to the religion that</v>

17
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:23.421
<v Speaker 2>was totally impolite to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even to refeed that somebody ensure</v>

18
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 2>Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a,</v>

19
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 2>there were options like any other</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians who happened to be just like</v>

20
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptians who happen to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians or Muslims.</v>

21
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 2>So we had our very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very great positive experience about</v>

22
00:01:38.521 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Jews with Jews.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

23
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.260
<v Speaker 2>the problem with us was not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem was was Israel,</v>

24
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is very dangerous to confuse the</v>

25
00:01:50.731 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 2>two concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that some people in Israel</v>

26
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 2>feel very comfortable to confuse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to confuse,</v>

27
00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 2>to mix up the two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 2>concepts in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that if you are critical</v>

29
00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:09.141
<v Speaker 2>against some Israeli policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so accordingly you are against Jews.</v>

30
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 2>And this is terribly wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terribly wrong.</v>

31
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I am,</v>

32
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 2>I believe that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am very critical against the Saudi</v>

33
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>regime and I believe it's a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 2>regime,</v>

34
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 2>but this does not mean that I'm against</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Arabs or Muslims.</v>

35
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.580
<v Speaker 2>So I think that we never had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we never had really a problem or a</v>

36
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 2>discrimination against Jews in the hole.</v>
