00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>One of the interesting things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare today is the data is becoming</v>

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>unsiloed and increasingly accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm wearing right now a little patch</v>
<v Speaker 1>will a company called vital connect or</v>

4
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 1>if my shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's talking to my smartphone live and I</v>

5
00:00:20.101 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>can look at my dashboard and my data for</v>
<v Speaker 1>my full,</v>

6
00:00:22.801 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>an ekg which will show up right here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can track the trends and hopefully my</v>

7
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>ekg looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there were any cardiologists out</v>

9
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could also see data about my steps,</v>

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>my stress level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my position.</v>

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>If I fall down and I don't get back up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the system can tell that.</v>

14
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>And this is really an intensive care</v>
<v Speaker 1>unit,</v>

15
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.190
<v Speaker 1>like type level data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a way it will be know less than $5 a</v>

16
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disposable Patch,</v>

17
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>which can be useful if you're training</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a marathon.</v>

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.150
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a hospital and you're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a monitored bed.</v>

19
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>If you're home with a disease like heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure,</v>

20
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot of data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to learn to sift through it and</v>

21
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>pull out the signals because no</v>
<v Speaker 1>physician or nurse is going to want to</v>

22
00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>be liable for watching your live</v>
<v Speaker 1>streaming ekg,</v>

23
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>but is an immense amount of power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>data and we're in this era now of</v>

24
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>creating digital health exhaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:01:07.741 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's my smartwatch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this patch,</v>

26
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can tell a lot about me,</v>

27
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>my behaviors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for example,</v>

28
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.800
<v Speaker 1>you have a patient who's got bipolar</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

29
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 1>you can tell from their phone whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're depressed or they're manic.</v>

30
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>That can play a role in in smart disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease management.</v>

31
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>We can take technologies like three d</v>
<v Speaker 1>printing and tune homebase prosthetics.</v>

32
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>We can print prosthetic hands for folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and legs and the developing world.</v>

33
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>Here's mini me and my pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a three d printed version of me</v>

34
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>that might be interesting if I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a prosthetic for someone who's lost</v>

35
00:01:40.831 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>part of their face or I was at mit media</v>
<v Speaker 1>lab last week and met a young grad</v>

36
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 1>student who diagnosis ain't own brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

37
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>written up in the New York Times and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>three d printing to print a version of</v>

38
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:52.291
<v Speaker 1>his tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

39
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:53.124
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want a printer?</v>

40
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to print in my brain tumor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This helped us surgeons do a better job</v>

41
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>of finding it and removing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was proactive.</v>

42
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:03.090
<v Speaker 1>He noticed some neurologic symptoms and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed for his own.</v>

43
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>A repeat MRI that helped them get</v>
<v Speaker 1>diagnosed earlier.</v>

44
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I have in my pocket and new</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercialized version of a brain</v>

45
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.590
<v Speaker 1>computer interface from a company called</v>
<v Speaker 1>interacts,</v>

46
00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:16.090
<v Speaker 1>so this is the muse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can wear this headset and kind of</v>

47
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>use this for APA.</v>

48
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Find Mindfulness and meditation and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>might use this to prescribe to a patient</v>

49
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>who has anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of giving them a drug,</v>

50
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I give them a headset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they can do meditation the old</v>

51
00:02:26.161 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>fashioned way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this enables you to quantify it and</v>

52
00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>have a bit of a feedback loop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ability to sort of quantify our</v>

53
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>own minds with brain computer interface</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this can be used to treat</v>

54
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.700
<v Speaker 1>everything from ptsd to Adhd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to see use of video games to</v>

55
00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:44.180
<v Speaker 1>improve cognition or to treat disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing fancy brain computer</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfaces from my Alma Mater,</v>

57
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown university,</v>

58
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.830
<v Speaker 1>to enable someone who's quadriplegic</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by thinking to move a robotic limb</v>

59
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>and those are getting smaller and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated.</v>

60
00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:58.380
<v Speaker 1>And so the disabled in the future may</v>
<v Speaker 1>just think move my arm and it'll be</v>

61
00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>rewired back to the road arm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It benefit the spinal cord injury.</v>

62
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.150
<v Speaker 1>So lots of ways to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>sometimes consumer devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowdsource new apps and platforms on</v>

64
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>these that will change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatry,</v>

66
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>and when we can pull this data together</v>
<v Speaker 1>will become,</v>

67
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>become participatory in healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can move to an era,</v>

68
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:19.720
<v Speaker 1>kind of like with Google maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you donate some data when you use ways</v>

69
00:03:19.721 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>and Google maps through privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your speed and your location.</v>

70
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>But in exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can build a map of your,</v>

71
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>of the streets and the traffic so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get some information back.</v>

72
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>I think we can have that same</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensibility and healthcare,</v>

73
00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.730
<v Speaker 1>whether it's sharing your brainwaves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your genomics,</v>

74
00:03:32.731 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>or your wearable data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while maintaining privacy and optin</v>

75
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Using that information can give us</v>

76
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:40.460
<v Speaker 1>better public health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>better early signals if it's ebola</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming or the common flu,</v>

78
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>or can enable patient groups to</v>
<v Speaker 1>crowdsource better cures.</v>

79
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>For Crohn's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

80
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>there's this new world of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>microbiome.</v>

81
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.440
<v Speaker 1>We have 10,000 times 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 times more bacterial cells in an</v>

82
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>honorable in and on our bodies and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>own human cells.</v>

83
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 1>We're learning that the microbiome plays</v>
<v Speaker 1>a role in everything from obesity to</v>

84
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory bowel disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Crohn's disease,</v>

85
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>maybe even some psychiatric disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're starting to be in this era of</v>

86
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 1>fecal transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can imagine in five,</v>

87
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:13.600
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get to and cocktail of a</v>

88
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>probiotic that's going to reboot your gi</v>
<v Speaker 1>system to help treat diseases or prevent</v>

89
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:20.690
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these tools are gonna.</v>

90
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Enable the clinician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be going to your corner,</v>

91
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacy in many cases to get medical</v>

92
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>care or telemedicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna enable you as an individual</v>

93
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>to own your own health information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's already thousands of apps out</v>

94
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are better than others,</v>

95
00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.740
<v Speaker 1>but you can use those as tools to stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged in taking your vitamin and your</v>

96
00:04:36.741 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>aspirin or being on top of a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>complex regimen.</v>

97
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>And the challenge for all of us is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrate these in the culture of health</v>

98
00:04:43.871 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>and medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the best technology,</v>

99
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but unless your clinician uses it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets paid for it,</v>

100
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 1>in some cases it may never be adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The payers of the world needs to start</v>

101
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>looking at how some of these can provide</v>
<v Speaker 1>better outcomes at lower cost and even</v>

102
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>before they're fda approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bringing these to market and I think</v>

103
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:02.230
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing many smart Pharma</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

104
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.940
<v Speaker 1>payers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physician groups,</v>

105
00:05:03.941 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>think about how they layer these in to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be the disrupter and not the disruptee.</v>
