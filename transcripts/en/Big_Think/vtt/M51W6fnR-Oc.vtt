1
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>There's a sort of a funny saying which</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that whenever people are are free to</v>

2
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 1>choose anything they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually choose what their friends</v>

3
00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>have chosen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mimicry that we humans events is</v>

4
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>extremely fundamental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

5
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>networks provide us a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical,</v>

6
00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.100
<v Speaker 1>social and biological tool to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of fundamental basis for this</v>

7
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>mimicry because you copy the people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whom you are connected primarily and</v>

8
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:35.260
<v Speaker 1>you'll come to copy them along the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of traits in the workplace.</v>

9
00:00:35.261 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 1>These traits might include things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how energized you are at work or a how</v>

10
00:00:39.641 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>innovative you are at work or how</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperative you are at work or whether</v>

11
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you smoke or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our other health traits,</v>

12
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.870
<v Speaker 1>all of these desirable properties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your productivity,</v>

13
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>your innovativeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your cooperativeness,</v>

14
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:56.650
<v Speaker 1>your health come to depend upon the like</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes in individuals to whom you're</v>

15
00:00:56.651 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 1>connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our group and other groups have mapped</v>

16
00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>networks in the workplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come to understand how people are</v>

17
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>connected to each other and have used</v>
<v Speaker 1>that understanding as a kind of</v>

18
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>mechanism or tool and opportunity for</v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention in order to call forth from</v>

19
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

20
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm better behavior if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More cooperativeness,</v>

21
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>more innovativeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a more um,</v>

22
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 1>collaborativeness and better health</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

23
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.330
<v Speaker 1>The usual way of understanding workplace</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization is the classic Org Chart</v>

24
00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>where you have boxes and names and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tree,</v>

25
00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually the real work or the</v>

26
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>reorganization of a workplace looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>

27
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the way people interact with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

28
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a more jumble of ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks more like a jumble of Christmas</v>

29
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:43.960
<v Speaker 1>tree lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you can think of a network as</v>

30
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 1>every note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every person is a little light and the</v>

31
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>wires connecting them are the ties</v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>And when you take out a jumble of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree lights and you put it on</v>

33
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 1>the floor and look at it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what workplace networks really</v>

34
00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you understand those patterns of</v>

35
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can begin to understand how people</v>

36
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 1>influence each other with respect to</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and health behaviors in the</v>

37
00:02:03.461 --> 00:02:04.270
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>

38
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>And once you understand that pattern of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions and that pattern of</v>

39
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 1>influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can begin to think about ways of</v>

40
00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:11.560
<v Speaker 1>intervening in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

41
00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:15.530
<v Speaker 1>you can identify influential individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the network and target them with,</v>

42
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>with health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.460
<v Speaker 1>interventions or you can identify ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get groups of people to sign up for</v>

44
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.650
<v Speaker 1>interventions and we know that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of people,</v>

45
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>particularly people who know each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>and are interconnected collaboratively</v>

46
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:31.870
<v Speaker 1>engage in something such as a health</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement behavior,</v>

47
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.290
<v Speaker 1>that they're more likely to sustain it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more likely to respond positively.</v>

48
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>So once you understand the structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human interactions,</v>

49
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.770
<v Speaker 1>it opens up all kinds of new vistas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ways that you can intervene.</v>
