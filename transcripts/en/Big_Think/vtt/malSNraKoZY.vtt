1
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes down to equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>which is I think such a silly thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in 2008,</v>

3
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it comes down to sort of</v>

4
00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right to get married,</v>

5
00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 1>the right to file your taxes together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospital visitation rights,</v>

6
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

7
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>and I think beyond that is equality</v>
<v Speaker 1>including in the military with don't</v>

8
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell,</v>

9
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>which seems to always be a hot button</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue that pops up,</v>

10
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.100
<v Speaker 1>once a year or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but especially now with the presidential</v>

12
00:00:39.101 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates taking a aside on the issue.</v>

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.691
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

15
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it comes down to basic civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights</v>

16
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>because I think it remains even among</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who claim to support gay rights.</v>

17
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:04.490
<v Speaker 1>I think it remains a taboo subject in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that while if we're saying the majority</v>

18
00:01:04.491 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 1>of America has no problem with gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

19
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's an asterisk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position no problem with gay people so</v>

20
00:01:11.031 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>long as you're not my son as long as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not my sister.</v>

21
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

22
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think the idea of introducing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and into one's personal life,</v>

23
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether people will own up to it or not</v>

24
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.390
<v Speaker 1>remains an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very easy from the bubble</v>

25
00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>of New York or la just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>this should be a nonissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there so much,</v>

27
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>so many opinions and views in between</v>
<v Speaker 1>those coasts that don't necessarily</v>

28
00:01:33.771 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's very clear that I'm a</v>

29
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>evangelical and a very conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious groups,</v>

30
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain quite a bit of power in this</v>

31
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>country because there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear that candidates are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are leaning one way or the other one</v>

33
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to their approach of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are viewpoints,</v>

34
00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be taken seriously on the</v>

35
00:01:59.271 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

36
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>it's there that these things are going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>

38
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.170
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a,</v>

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>I have a personal issue with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea that some people can</v>

40
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>tolerate homosexuality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I do not tolerate women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not tolerate black or Asian people.</v>

42
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I embraced them as they would anyone</v>

43
00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think right now we're sending</v>

44
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:35.441
<v Speaker 1>this message of a tolerance and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a stepping stone toward embracing</v>

45
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>or even so much so that it's a nonissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think right now the goal needs to be,</v>

47
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

48
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>to promote this as a normalized a sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of behavior.</v>

49
00:02:48.771 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think that if we're taking these</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bandaid or sideways approaches</v>

50
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 1>to get to a final result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to end up with something</v>

51
00:02:56.181 --> 00:02:59.550
<v Speaker 1>that's still not viewed very well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

52
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I think the message we need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitching is,</v>

53
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of normalized behavior.</v>

54
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Gay people are just like straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

55
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>They just leap with the same sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

56
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.640
<v Speaker 1>that's really all it comes down to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easier for me to say that's</v>

57
00:03:14.641 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>such a simple message,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only because I live in a very urban</v>

58
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a gay man.</v>

59
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 1>on the same token,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's very easy for,</v>

61
00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.071
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>other folks in more conservative parts</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country,</v>

63
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept that message.</v>

64
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.990
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit torn there because I</v>

65
00:03:35.991 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>think Hollywood shouldn't necessarily be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a platform for any message,</v>

66
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.390
<v Speaker 1>but then I also believe it's foolish to</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that it doesn't,</v>

67
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.080
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the very basic of cutting out</v>

69
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>smoking for movies and what that did to</v>
<v Speaker 1>views toward people who smoke.</v>

70
00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.181
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:53.181 --> 00:03:58.181
<v Speaker 1>I think we're moving beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to think the token gay character</v>

72
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.880
<v Speaker 1>in movies and TV shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.630
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we're quite there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's important to show</v>

74
00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:06.570
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.620
<v Speaker 1>even in mainstream movies to have gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lesbian characters who are</v>

76
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:15.290
<v Speaker 1>normalized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not the token gay character.</v>

77
00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.180
<v Speaker 1>They are another character in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

78
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.081
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

79
00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:23.081
<v Speaker 1>and I liked the idea of sort of a plot</v>
<v Speaker 1>lines within a TV and film that deal</v>

80
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:29.060
<v Speaker 1>with gay men and women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't necessarily focus on that as a</v>

81
00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>sole issue because then I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it sort of creates a caricature</v>

82
00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>of what this is supposed to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

83
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:39.200
<v Speaker 1>I do think to an extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood does hold some responsibility,</v>

84
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.370
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:42.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>homophobia exists in that industry like</v>

86
00:04:42.591 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 1>any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:04:43.761 --> 00:04:46.490
<v Speaker 1>while you know your agent or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicist can be gay,</v>

88
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't expect to sign on to a movie as an</v>

89
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.470
<v Speaker 1>open gay person a and an expected big</v>
<v Speaker 1>paycheck.</v>

90
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.250
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a movie goer to say Hollywood.</v>

91
00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>The institution needs to change their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

92
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>But I also think if they've put a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a openly gay character in a,</v>

93
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>in a major motion picture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it would perform as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the bar at the box office.</v>

95
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>So I think we do need to take small</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps to reach that end all goal.</v>

96
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to happen overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it'd be foolish to assume</v>

97
00:05:22.811 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

98
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:30.151
<v Speaker 1>I think the American public does still</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this cringe mentality when it comes</v>

100
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:36.781
<v Speaker 1>to the idea of gay men and women playing</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading roles or roles where they aren't</v>

101
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 1>the gay character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>all the way to Hollywood that is fearful</v>
<v Speaker 1>of even opening up that possibility</v>

103
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.570
<v Speaker 1>because the investment is so large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

104
00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a studio wants to make that bet.</v>
