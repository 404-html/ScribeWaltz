1
00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.653
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.070
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree.</v>

3
00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:14.071
<v Speaker 1>I people have been attacking Alan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greenspan pretty vigorously in the press</v>

4
00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lane.</v>

5
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>The whole blame for the credit crisis at</v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet.</v>

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>So what I think about that is it is two</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

7
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>One is that in the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alan Greenspan could do no wrong.</v>

8
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:35.851
<v Speaker 1>He was hailed as the maestro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Woodward wrote a book called the</v>

9
00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:37.550
<v Speaker 1>Maestro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Woodward said,</v>

11
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the wizard of Oz,</v>

12
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 1>when the man comes out behind the from</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the curtain,</v>

13
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>when the wizard chose his face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel a little bit underwhelmed.</v>

14
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>But with Alan Greenspan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we always feel safe or something like</v>

15
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they gave him too much credit</v>

16
00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>for monetary policies when times were</v>
<v Speaker 1>good because when times are good things,</v>

17
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>when the economy is strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monetary policy is really sort of</v>

18
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:15.100
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what Alan Greenspan did and realized</v>

19
00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>was he just got out of the way and let</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity drive the economy.</v>

20
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where the real test of a central</v>

21
00:01:23.891 --> 00:01:28.891
<v Speaker 1>banker it comes is when the usual rule</v>
<v Speaker 1>books don't apply when you're not just</v>

22
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:33.370
<v Speaker 1>making monetary policy for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for</v>

23
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>ordinary times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where when you're subject to</v>

24
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>some fundamental strains on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial system.</v>

25
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>And Greenspan faced several such</v>
<v Speaker 1>incidents.</v>

26
00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>The first was October of 1987 when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market collapsed.</v>

27
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Another was the Asian financial crisis</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 nineties,</v>

28
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>the Russian bond default in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

29
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>there was the collapse of longterm</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital management and the 19 nineties</v>

30
00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.570
<v Speaker 1>there was 9:11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in all of those cases,</v>

31
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Alan Greenspan understood what the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the role of the central bank was,</v>

32
00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:22.411
<v Speaker 1>was to provide enough liquidity and keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the financial system functioning.</v>

33
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 1>And because he knew enough because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that in those instances,</v>

34
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:31.390
<v Speaker 1>he came out of those crises with his</v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation is enhanced.</v>

35
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was his real genius,</v>

36
00:02:35.951 --> 00:02:40.220
<v Speaker 1>was to know what to do when the system</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

37
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.080
<v Speaker 1>was in a severe crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for all those reasons,</v>

38
00:02:44.081 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>the shocks that were felt than didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>become the new normal.</v>

39
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>So the charge against him is in lately</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been that he kept interest rates too</v>

40
00:02:56.561 --> 00:03:01.561
<v Speaker 1>low for too long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when he left office there wasn't a</v>

41
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:06.170
<v Speaker 1>lot of inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a real question about what do</v>

42
00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>you mean by interest rates being too low</v>
<v Speaker 1>for too long?</v>

43
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>It was not the case that he caused the</v>
<v Speaker 1>housing bubble.</v>

44
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Having interest rates low doesn't mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make unwise loans.</v>

45
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Nor nor did he encouraged people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that prices could only go up and</v>

46
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think he's a convenient scapegoat.</v>
