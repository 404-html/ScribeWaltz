00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:01.493
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I did not collect the tomes written for</v>
<v Speaker 1>one kind of high,</v>

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>had relatively little to do with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

4
00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>That book was collected largely by</v>
<v Speaker 1>attorneys who volunteer their time to</v>

5
00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>work with people who were detained often</v>
<v Speaker 1>with minimal,</v>

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>amazingly minimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>legal process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>people who were detained at Guantanamo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

9
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:30.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would assume with that,</v>

10
00:00:30.811 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>knowing very little about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tremendous range,</v>

11
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

12
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally range of a bunch shirt ranges</v>

14
00:00:41.621 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>for people who are tremendously guilty</v>
<v Speaker 1>of many things.</v>

15
00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>The people who were really center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

16
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:50.931
<v Speaker 1>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the editor at the press.</v>

17
00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It was about to publish that book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally talked to me about writing an</v>

18
00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.951
<v Speaker 1>introduction and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent me the manuscript.</v>

19
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I tried conscientiously to read the</v>
<v Speaker 1>poems and uh,</v>

20
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>I hope I correctly recognized my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequacy.</v>

21
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I was not going to be able to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction to these palms.</v>

22
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>You would have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the minimum,</v>

23
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>you would have to know something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic poetry.</v>

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>You would have to know a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these cultures.</v>

25
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come from cultures in which amateur</v>

26
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 1>poetry is a very important component.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm familiar with amateur poetry,</v>

27
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've taught adult classes.</v>

28
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:33.620
<v Speaker 1>I've taught in prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't say amateur with a sneer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>in many ways it's possible to idealize</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country in which there's a lot of</v>

31
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>amateur poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 1>it might be good for professionals like</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

33
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.973
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.440
<v Speaker 1>but I felt inadequate to writing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduction.</v>

35
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I felt strongly about the abuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties and,</v>

37
00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

38
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military people were shocked.</v>

39
00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Millet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in military people,</v>

40
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

41
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>military people were appalled at what</v>
<v Speaker 1>was happening there.</v>

42
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And these guys who've just been a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous fixed the pickle they were</v>

43
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd been put in by the government of</v>

44
00:02:23.941 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>my country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to just say,</v>

45
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:26.821
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

46
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>This is not my field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to write a blurb,</v>

47
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would at least put my name in the</v>

48
00:02:33.511 --> 00:02:35.670
<v Speaker 1>book and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an urgent book for us to be</v>

49
00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>aware of when you're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people.</v>

50
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't just be sealed away.</v>

51
00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

52
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart from leasing from a government</v>

53
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that we don't work it as a part of Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.250
<v Speaker 1>if you read that in facilities Hurghada</v>
<v Speaker 1>disputes,</v>

55
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I can't figure these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

56
00:02:51.821 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on here.</v>

57
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there they are in this part of Cuba that</v>

58
00:02:55.501 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>we lease from this government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We refuse to have anything to do with</v>

59
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must have just forget about them.</v>

60
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to be thought about.</v>

61
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.383
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I was speaking because I had been</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealed to it.</v>

63
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>We've very aware that my gifts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>

64
00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they are as a poet,</v>

65
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>we're not terrifically Germane to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

66
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>To that point.</v>
