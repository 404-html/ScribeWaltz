1
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:05.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 2>as important as it is to cross</v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines to transgress boundaries,</v>

3
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>whether it's science and art or even</v>
<v Speaker 2>boundaries within science,</v>

4
00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 2>it is very tough to do in practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is very tough to interact with</v>

5
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:23.390
<v Speaker 2>someone who speaks a different language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who uses different acronyms,</v>

6
00:00:23.391 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 2>who had tax problems from different</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspectives.</v>

7
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 2>So I think we have to do everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible to not only encourage this to</v>

8
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 2>give out more grants that funded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 2>funding is of course a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge problem for interdisciplinary</v>

10
00:00:34.341 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 2>but also I think begin to make a</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious,</v>

12
00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 2>rigorous case for these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interactions.</v>

13
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 2>I think too often it's easy to write off</v>
<v Speaker 2>interdisciplinary collaborations is kind</v>

14
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 2>of feel good exercises when I think the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and literature may clear that</v>

15
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:49.370
<v Speaker 2>there's often a really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

16
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.510
<v Speaker 2>if not the most productive way of coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>together way of collaborating.</v>

17
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 2>And in a sense we see the most when we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are on the outside of a field looking</v>

18
00:00:57.921 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my favorite examples of this is the</v>

19
00:00:59.901 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 2>website innocentive.com which is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a crowdsourcing website used by</v>

20
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 2>various fortune 100 companies.</v>

21
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.240
<v Speaker 2>So Eli Lilly helped develop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

22
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 2>Pfizer uses it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Proctor and gamble uses the General</v>

23
00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>Electric Kraft foods companies with</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>

24
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Speaker 2>huge r and d budgets and the billions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars,</v>

25
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 2>but they do is they post their hardest</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific problems on this website.</v>

26
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 2>The problems their own scientists can</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve and they catch a reward to it.</v>

27
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you can solve a problem for g a</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemistry problem,</v>

28
00:01:26.871 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 2>say maybe you'll get $1 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it will be $50,000 who knows?</v>

29
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:31.574
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

30
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 2>that's the incentive part of incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

31
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 2>the first surprisingly about [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot com is that it works about anywhere</v>

32
00:01:37.161 --> 00:01:40.940
<v Speaker 2>between 30 to 50% of these problems are</v>
<v Speaker 2>solved within six months.</v>

33
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 2>Some are solved within days of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>posted online.</v>

34
00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is kind of surprising,</v>

35
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because here problems that these huge</v>

36
00:01:47.181 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 2>companies can solve and yet some</v>
<v Speaker 2>stranger sitting on his couch in his</v>

37
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:53.540
<v Speaker 2>pajamas while eating fruit loops is</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving them,</v>

38
00:01:53.541 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 2>making it look easy.</v>

39
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Now what's most interesting but</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives,</v>

40
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 2>how these problems get solved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is work by cream and Connie at</v>

41
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Harvard business school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is shown that let's say ge posted</v>

42
00:02:03.171 --> 00:02:07.280
<v Speaker 2>chemistry problem online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then prom is almost never solved by</v>

43
00:02:07.281 --> 00:02:09.530
<v Speaker 2>another chemist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead it's all biomolecular molecular</v>

44
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 2>biologist by biophysicists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by someone who knows enough to</v>

45
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 2>understand the terms of the question but</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know so much that they run into</v>

46
00:02:16.941 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 2>the exact same stumbling blocks as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>chemist back at Ge.</v>

47
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 2>So this is a real testament to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtues of outsider thinking and</v>

48
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 2>outsider creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we have to realize that this</v>

49
00:02:26.991 --> 00:02:28.970
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a real thing that we have to</v>

50
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 2>incorporate in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.030
<v Speaker 2>in you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in everyday work,</v>

52
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the everyday world.</v>

53
00:02:32.931 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 2>Cause I think we come with this tacit</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumption that if you're struggling</v>

54
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 2>with a really hard problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to give to the guy who knows the</v>

55
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:43.850
<v Speaker 2>most to those expert insiders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But sometimes when it comes to</v>

56
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 2>creativity and innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes knowledge is a blind spot.</v>

57
00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we can know too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes we have our best thoughts when</v>

58
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 2>we're working with someone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a different field,</v>

59
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.210
<v Speaker 2>tackling a problem just beyond our area</v>
<v Speaker 2>of expertise.</v>

60
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.560
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I think that's,</v>

61
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>that's a very practical case for</v>
<v Speaker 2>interdisciplinary collaboration.</v>

62
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
