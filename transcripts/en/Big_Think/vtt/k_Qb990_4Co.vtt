00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.940
<v Speaker 1>Look simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

2
00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>When you're dealing with a master of</v>
<v Speaker 1>slight of hand,</v>

3
00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>like my partner teller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the simplest activity may be a</v>

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>complex deception.</v>

5
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Tell number fascinated by how stupid</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic is.</v>

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 2>That magic is going through all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>elaborate machinations to make something</v>

7
00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:30.461
<v Speaker 2>look one way that's really another and</v>
<v Speaker 2>instruct us is really funny to do a</v>

8
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:35.711
<v Speaker 2>magic trick that accomplished reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tell her needs nothing but a pencil,</v>

9
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.580
<v Speaker 2>one lit cigarette and a flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's watch that original routine again.</v>

10
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 2>But this time from the other side and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>went through many,</v>

11
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 2>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were going to originally do it with</v>

12
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:57.230
<v Speaker 2>cooking or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but after weeks of trying to write this</v>

13
00:00:57.231 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we came up with the idea of how about</v>

14
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking out a cigarette,</v>

15
00:01:01.371 --> 00:01:04.220
<v Speaker 2>lighting it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>putting a cigarette out and then pulling</v>

16
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 2>out another cigarette and lighting it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about if we did that trick exactly</v>

17
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:13.121
<v Speaker 2>like that with all accomplished by</v>
<v Speaker 2>trickery stuff you could do simply.</v>

18
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 2>And that seemed to have such a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

19
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 2>purely existential field to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.190
<v Speaker 2>going through incredibly complicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>machinations to get to a very simple end</v>

21
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.580
<v Speaker 1>simulates a line liner when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashlight was the,</v>

22
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.980
<v Speaker 1>let's take a red pencil and the cover of</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdirection from the flashlight.</v>
