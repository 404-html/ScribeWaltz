<v Speaker 1>Favorite shakespeare character,</v>

32
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>character play speech moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything?</v>

33
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to point at a henry,</v>

34
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 2>the fifth in which I understudied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christopher plummer,</v>

35
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 2>who was playing henry fifth at stratford</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

36
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 2>many years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in repertory is especially this</v>

37
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 2>repertory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At stratford you open a play and then</v>

38
00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:19.041
<v Speaker 2>the next morning after you've opened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start rehearsals on new play and</v>

39
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 2>then you do that for four weeks and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>open that and maybe a third and a fourth</v>

40
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 2>so that the understudy rehearsals would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be delayed until you finished opening</v>

41
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 2>new plays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And about the third or fourth day I waS</v>

42
00:02:32.641 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 2>asked to go on stage as they understood</v>
<v Speaker 2>it because chris was ill for a moment</v>

43
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 2>and they asked me to go on and I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>never,</v>

44
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 2>not only had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never rehearsed it,</v>

45
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 2>I'd never said the words out loud,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had been drilling myself for some</v>

46
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 2>reason and I speculate about this and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>one man show.</v>

47
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Why did I drill those words so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so emphatically?</v>

48
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Because nobody ever goes on for an under</v>
<v Speaker 2>say no.</v>

49
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I've never been in an understudy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A relationship where somebody went on</v>

50
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>for me or I went on for somebody else</v>
<v Speaker 2>except in this one instance in which I</v>

51
00:03:06.821 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 2>had never spoken the words out loud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I went on stage in front of</v>

52
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>2,500 people in and critics and all</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

53
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:14.360
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

54
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.670
<v Speaker 1>so how did it feel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it terrifying?</v>

55
00:03:16.671 --> 00:03:17.504
<v Speaker 1>How did it</v>

56
00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 2>no know I was on a wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

57
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't recall being terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recall I've looked at pictures of</v>

58
00:03:25.761 --> 00:03:30.761
<v Speaker 2>laird hamilton coming down to a way that</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 70 foot wave and I've got to think</v>

59
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 2>that he had the same feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I did this,</v>

60
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.180
<v Speaker 2>this thing pursuing you and your writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't lose your confidence</v>

61
00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:43.730
<v Speaker 2>because the moment you doubt your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's over.</v>

62
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.880
<v Speaker 1>So it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's how,</v>

63
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.400
<v Speaker 1>that's how it is For you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You feel that you must,</v>

64
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you must keep self doubt completely at</v>
<v Speaker 1>bay because I've often thought that,</v>

65
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.781
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>for me anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can feel the self doubt and then</v>

67
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:56.130
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

68
00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:57.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.270
<v Speaker 1>there that is and still do your thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:04:00.271 --> 00:04:01.280
<v Speaker 1>and just having a</v>

71
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.230
<v Speaker 2>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can say,</v>

72
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:09.090
<v Speaker 2>oh well there'S no doubt there's fear</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there is a dread and there,</v>

73
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 2>oh look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's hysteria coming monday.</v>

74
00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 2>somehow deal with it and press on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For me in life,</v>

76
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 2>denial is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denied.</v>

77
00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Denied the experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denial.</v>

78
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that hasn't happened.</v>

79
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 2>Is not going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even want to think about it and</v>

80
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I'll die before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

81
00:04:29.771 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I experienced that and eventually it all</v>
<v Speaker 2>goes away anyway,</v>

82
00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>so I'm half jewish and so for all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>semi or fully.</v>

83
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:38.920
<v Speaker 1>But go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jason,</v>

84
00:04:38.921 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>you should be in denial about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:41.231 --> 00:04:45.970
<v Speaker 1>I was going say that woody allen gave us</v>
<v Speaker 1>all permission to sort of recognize the</v>

86
00:04:45.971 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>terror and the anxiety and simply to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move forward and turn it into something</v>

87
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if not sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least acceptable in his case.</v>

88
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>Turn it into a career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So you've had an amazingly varied</v>
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

90
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:03.610
<v Speaker 1>You're your best known to the general</v>
<v Speaker 1>public probably for the star trek films,</v>

91
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:06.720
<v Speaker 1>but you've been doing a million things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

92
00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and you've been writing for years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>years now.</v>

93
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>How did writing enter the picture for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were,</v>

94
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what point did you decide to start</v>

95
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>taking writing seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the right way to put it?</v>

96
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

98
00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 2>the written word is where everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>begins and ends.</v>

99
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I've always known that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've always written in one manner or</v>

100
00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:25.800
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love poetry.</v>

101
00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I love the usage of words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.560
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was just starting out,</v>

103
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I wrote some television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half our players,</v>

104
00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 2>which the canadian broadcasting</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporation,</v>

105
00:05:36.841 --> 00:05:41.841
<v Speaker 2>the cbc in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was the equivalent of say nbc here</v>

106
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.960
<v Speaker 2>bought and I cast one of those shows a</v>
<v Speaker 2>girl and eventually married her.</v>

107
00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:53.391
<v Speaker 2>She becAme the mother of my children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've been writing a long time,</v>

108
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 2>but the breath more measured and works</v>
<v Speaker 2>started when there was a strike by some</v>

109
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 2>unions while I was making a film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there was nothing I could do.</v>

110
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:10.040
<v Speaker 2>I had to sit around and wait for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>strike to be over.</v>

111
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 2>So I started writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gave myself the premise of a policeman</v>

112
00:06:14.421 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 2>in space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had done a police series.</v>

113
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

114
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 2>I began at 10 books and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it became 10 books a year,</v>

115
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 2>a year series and a movie.</v>

116
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.360
<v Speaker 1>So I noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

117
00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:28.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking through your work.</v>

118
00:06:28.591 --> 00:06:30.280
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really love those,</v>

119
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>those albums that you did with ben folds</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

120
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:34.530
<v Speaker 1>They're really cool.</v>

121
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.450
<v Speaker 2>That album was called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been.</v>

122
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really look at that.</v>

123
00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.310
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

124
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

125
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just noticing that in both the</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing and in the music,</v>

126
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.570
<v Speaker 1>you're collaborating and you seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy collaborating.</v>

127
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean acting is the collaborative art</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

128
00:06:50.001 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 1>Do you find that you prefer to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people as opposed to a in</v>

129
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>solitude?</v>

130
00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 2>So science fiction is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a strange form Your imagining a</v>

131
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:08.381
<v Speaker 2>plot and people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also littered with scientific</v>

132
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 2>possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>EIther imaginative possibilities are</v>

133
00:07:12.651 --> 00:07:16.550
<v Speaker 2>possibilities that exist in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>laboratory that may come into existence</v>

134
00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.520
<v Speaker 2>years from now and you have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquainted with all that.</v>

135
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 2>And it's a very esoteric</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquaintanceship to know science</v>

136
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 2>intimately to be able to write about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No science individually.</v>

137
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 2>Jeff rovin is tHis wonderful writer who</v>
<v Speaker 2>has that knowledge.</v>

138
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.600
<v Speaker 2>So doing the two of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>me working on the more emotional aspects</v>

139
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>and the plot and him working on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific aspects.</v>

140
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:44.380
<v Speaker 2>We've created a lovely novel filled with</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific possibilities.</v>

141
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.050
<v Speaker 2>Both that takes the plot along or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are added like little diamonds that that</v>

142
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:55.631
<v Speaker 2>you'll read and may even smile at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>new political unions that couldn't</v>

143
00:07:55.971 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 2>possibly be right in our year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 50 years might very well come to be.</v>

144
00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.150
<v Speaker 2>That sort of thing is great fun.</v>

145
00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.960
<v Speaker 1>What are so in the new buck in zero g?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think I gave enough of an</v>

146
00:08:07.961 --> 00:08:10.450
<v Speaker 1>overview of the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to give too much away.</v>

147
00:08:10.451 --> 00:08:15.220
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely a fun and interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>thriller set.</v>

148
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:20.221
<v Speaker 1>In 2025,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are some of your favorite moments</v>

149
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.570
<v Speaker 1>or ideas in the book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anything you'd want to kind of highlight</v>

150
00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:26.920
<v Speaker 1>for people who haven't read it?</v>

151
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have a character there.</v>

152
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.700
<v Speaker 2>We took from the present day publiCity</v>
<v Speaker 2>about people who feel they've been born</v>

153
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:40.680
<v Speaker 2>in the wrong body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we named that character ed zilla and</v>

154
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.510
<v Speaker 2>adzilla instead of going for an</v>
<v Speaker 2>operation,</v>

155
00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 2>a changing his or her sex is able to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>it by.</v>

156
00:08:47.081 --> 00:08:52.081
<v Speaker 2>We'll that's totally an imaginative</v>
<v Speaker 2>concept taken from the ongoing</v>

157
00:08:53.561 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>controversies that are in our day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>age,</v>

158
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:01.820
<v Speaker 2>but someday in the future there'll be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical implant whereby by an act of</v>

159
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 2>will you can change your sex.</v>

160
00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found that really fascinating.</v>

161
00:09:05.891 --> 00:09:08.470
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adzilla his parents,</v>

162
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess genetically altered her either</v>

163
00:09:11.441 --> 00:09:13.560
<v Speaker 1>at birth or pre-birth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

164
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.110
<v Speaker 1>and so that raises some interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethical issues.</v>

165
00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like about w w we are going to come to a</v>

166
00:09:20.681 --> 00:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>point no doubt in the near future when</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents actually may have some stuff</v>

167
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.210
<v Speaker 2>control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think with enough instrumentation that</v>

168
00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:31.660
<v Speaker 2>could look into that aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

169
00:09:31.661 --> 00:09:36.640
<v Speaker 2>of an unborn baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So since we're on the verge and in fact</v>

170
00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:39.430
<v Speaker 2>did not on the verge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're genetically altering,</v>

171
00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:44.850
<v Speaker 2>but we're on the verge of genetically</v>
<v Speaker 2>altering almost anything easily.</v>

172
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Why wouldn't it be possible to go inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>even just a concept and alter the</v>

173
00:09:51.431 --> 00:09:56.431
<v Speaker 2>genetic structure of the unborn child?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is happening when they see diseases</v>

174
00:09:56.771 --> 00:10:01.090
<v Speaker 2>that are abnormal or why couldn't you do</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost anything?</v>

175
00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me ask you this,</v>

176
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:08.270
<v Speaker 1>if you were in a position to sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>start all over and have kids and you had</v>

178
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.820
<v Speaker 1>sort of unlimited genetic alteration</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

179
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:17.170
<v Speaker 1>what would you take advantage of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what would the limitS be for you</v>

180
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:18.004
<v Speaker 1>personally?</v>

181
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see what you're addressing.</v>

182
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:25.311
<v Speaker 2>there is a real moral problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much do you altered genetically?</v>

183
00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.050
<v Speaker 2>That goes for food as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

184
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 2>gmos are apparently healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're allowing us to feed 7 billion</v>

185
00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:38.580
<v Speaker 2>people that shouldn't be on earth in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first place by being able to feed seven</v>

186
00:10:38.581 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 2>and maybe 10 to 11 billion people in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>very near future.</v>

187
00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 2>We like lemmings have destroyed our</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment and we're only going to</v>

188
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:51.150
<v Speaker 2>destroy it further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've genetically altered crops to</v>

189
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 2>avoid disease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the limitation is not only on what</v>

190
00:10:55.441 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 2>food is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how many people we can procreate and</v>

191
00:10:59.341 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 2>chinese tried to do it by limiting it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>

192
00:11:02.731 --> 00:11:05.850
<v Speaker 2>but that didn't work because now their</v>
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

193
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't want girls.</v>

194
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 2>They wanted boys and saw a whole human</v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect to something that was going to be</v>

195
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:15.610
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A scientific breakthrough that offered</v>

196
00:11:15.611 --> 00:11:19.320
<v Speaker 2>to humanity the hope of feeding</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody and having no,</v>

197
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 2>no starvation morphs into more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more pollution and a the end of the</v>

198
00:11:25.531 --> 00:11:30.000
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the world is nigh because of</v>

199
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 2>the number of people on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you reduce the number of</v>

200
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:38.610
<v Speaker 2>people on earth without getting into</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass murder,</v>

201
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:42.950
<v Speaker 2>are altering the baby in vitro did not</v>
<v Speaker 2>being able to have any children.</v>

202
00:11:42.951 --> 00:11:47.951
<v Speaker 2>I mean the morality that that this</v>
<v Speaker 2>brings up is the springboard for so many</v>

203
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:51.180
<v Speaker 2>science fiction novels and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

204
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

205
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.261
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:58.880
<v Speaker 1>and you're in zero g there is that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to science station on the moon.</v>

207
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.470
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:03.170
<v Speaker 1>fairly complex space station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean that,</v>

209
00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least elon musk with his,</v>

210
00:12:05.901 --> 00:12:06.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>space x,</v>

211
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.941
<v Speaker 1>mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mars,</v>

212
00:12:07.941 --> 00:12:11.030
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission seems to think that that may be</v>

213
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:13.220
<v Speaker 1>one viable solution as well.</v>

214
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>There was no way that human beings can</v>
<v Speaker 2>colonize anyplace else other than than</v>

215
00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:26.230
<v Speaker 2>earth because the time it takes to reach</v>
<v Speaker 2>an earth like planet that has the</v>

216
00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:33.200
<v Speaker 2>proximity to its star and many of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>values here,</v>

217
00:12:33.201 --> 00:12:37.550
<v Speaker 2>which includes this thin skin of</v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere and the temperature range on</v>

218
00:12:37.551 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 2>the oxygen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the oxygen proportion came about by</v>

219
00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:43.880
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When chlorophyl stArted,</v>

220
00:12:43.881 --> 00:12:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean you go back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing bringS on another so that by</v>

221
00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:52.820
<v Speaker 2>evolving here on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we human beings have arrived at our</v>

222
00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:57.821
<v Speaker 2>reptilian brain and our complex forehead</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evolved over millions of years.</v>

223
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.910
<v Speaker 2>How the heck you can't live underground</v>
<v Speaker 2>on mars,</v>

224
00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.860
<v Speaker 2>even if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't.</v>

225
00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 2>That's we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we belong in sunlight.</v>

226
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.090
<v Speaker 2>And that sunlight is thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>

227
00:13:11.091 --> 00:13:14.690
<v Speaker 2>Even if you could go at a rocketship</v>
<v Speaker 2>near the speed of light,</v>

228
00:13:14.691 --> 00:13:17.390
<v Speaker 2>which you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take thousands of years.</v>

229
00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.800
<v Speaker 2>We have forgotten.</v>

230
00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:21.860
<v Speaker 2>We've got things on the books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laws on the books,</v>

231
00:13:21.861 --> 00:13:24.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>understandings with other nations on the</v>

232
00:13:24.681 --> 00:13:27.850
<v Speaker 2>books 50 years ago that we've forgotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they were and why you mill.</v>

233
00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:28.521
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

234
00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:30.650
<v Speaker 2>We made a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an agreement 50 years ago.</v>

235
00:13:30.651 --> 00:13:34.310
<v Speaker 2>We forgotten in 50 years what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement was or what we were supposed</v>

236
00:13:34.311 --> 00:13:37.340
<v Speaker 2>to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or imagine going a thousand years on a,</v>

237
00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:40.580
<v Speaker 2>on a voyage and somebody's saying 500</v>
<v Speaker 2>years from now,</v>

238
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:42.380
<v Speaker 2>why are we here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we,</v>

239
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.070
<v Speaker 2>where are we going on cheese?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forgotten what the,</v>

240
00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.750
<v Speaker 2>let's look back in the library and</v>
<v Speaker 2>dusting off 500 years old.</v>

241
00:13:50.751 --> 00:13:53.680
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're on our way to send us a what,</v>

242
00:13:53.681 --> 00:13:54.830
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we going there?</v>

243
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.780
<v Speaker 1>Maybe let's turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe if they can figure out where I'm</v>

244
00:13:57.781 --> 00:14:00.600
<v Speaker 1>hold travel and get us to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>exoplanets in,</v>

245
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes,</v>

246
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:04.530
<v Speaker 1>then we'll be in that situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

247
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

248
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:08.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's theoretically possible as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

249
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

250
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean stephen hawking seems to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

251
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:13.770
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

252
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that brings us to the second</v>

253
00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:19.140
<v Speaker 1>part of the show where we watch these</v>
<v Speaker 1>short surprise interview clips.</v>

254
00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've not seen them.</v>

255
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:22.680
<v Speaker 1>So I want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

256
00:14:22.681 --> 00:14:25.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have a genuinely</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous conversation.</v>

257
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:29.970
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is by ryan holiday,</v>

258
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.550
<v Speaker 1>who's an entrepreneur and author</v>

259
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:35.630
<v Speaker 2>so but with magician were thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>provoking.</v>

260
00:14:35.631 --> 00:14:36.464
<v Speaker 2>Is that what the idea is?</v>

261
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Ideally it is thought provoking and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not then it's my job to provoke.</v>

262
00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:41.610
<v Speaker 1>We'll make it fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

263
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:42.620
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

264
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.720
<v Speaker 1>so we'll both watch and then afterward</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk.</v>

265
00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 3>There's</v>

266
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.290
<v Speaker 1>a wonderful bill walsh quote about ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

267
00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.280
<v Speaker 1>no ego is when self confidence becomes</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogance.</v>

268
00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Self assertiveness becomes reckless</v>
<v Speaker 1>abandon and so forth.</v>

269
00:15:02.851 --> 00:15:03.684
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's saying it's,</v>

270
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.220
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of past the point of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable utility,</v>

271
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Confidence is great.</v>

272
00:15:08.631 --> 00:15:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Arrogance is not great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or cyril connolly's and ego like cancer</v>

273
00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:16.040
<v Speaker 1>is sort of an over assertion of cells</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of.</v>

274
00:15:16.041 --> 00:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>what I see ego is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great to believe in yourself.</v>

275
00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:22.640
<v Speaker 1>The problem is when your belief in</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself is not based on anything real,</v>

276
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and so that's the enemy of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of trying to do basically anything that</v>

277
00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:29.570
<v Speaker 1>requires interacting with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

278
00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:33.920
<v Speaker 1>If you're a creative and you're not able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take feedback because your ego is</v>

279
00:15:33.921 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 1>either so strong or you're not able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take feedback because you don't care</v>

280
00:15:37.731 --> 00:15:40.430
<v Speaker 1>what anyone thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your work's not going to get any better.</v>

281
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 1>If you don't care about your audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand who they are and</v>

282
00:15:44.181 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in their life because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lack empathy,</v>

283
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.610
<v Speaker 1>which is another symptom of ego.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your work is going to suffer.</v>

284
00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:51.840
<v Speaker 1>You can't work with other people because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>

285
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:53.170
<v Speaker 1>You have to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're selfish.</v>

286
00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You have to be the center of attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all times.</v>

287
00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:57.320
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to have a team around</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

288
00:15:57.321 --> 00:16:00.980
<v Speaker 1>so it basically makes anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to do harder than it</v>

289
00:16:00.981 --> 00:16:01.910
<v Speaker 1>already is.</v>

290
00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:04.140
<v Speaker 4>Mm.</v>

291
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get at,</v>

292
00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:10.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old phrase,</v>

293
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.570
<v Speaker 1>fake it till you make it right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know whether that advice</v>

294
00:16:14.571 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>rings true to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that at a certain point in</v>

295
00:16:17.301 --> 00:16:19.550
<v Speaker 1>your career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you're starting out and you're</v>

296
00:16:19.551 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 1>doing a bunch of new things and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>stretching yourself outside of your</v>

297
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.160
<v Speaker 1>comfort zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you kind of said earlier,</v>

298
00:16:25.161 --> 00:16:30.161
<v Speaker 1>you have to be sort of in denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>push down any doubt and just kind of in</v>

299
00:16:30.441 --> 00:16:33.380
<v Speaker 1>a way bluster forward perhaps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he's,</v>

300
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:36.290
<v Speaker 1>he's saying that that's kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous state of affairs.</v>

301
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:36.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

302
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.720
<v Speaker 1>if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm reading that right.</v>

303
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me first of all,</v>

304
00:16:40.101 --> 00:16:43.220
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's not correct but to what I said</v>

305
00:16:43.221 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 2>about denial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was half joking about denial,</v>

306
00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.860
<v Speaker 2>but indeed as a performer and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking specifically about being on</v>

307
00:16:50.861 --> 00:16:54.470
<v Speaker 2>stage and stage fright and all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the unknowns or a,</v>

308
00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a pilot for example.</v>

309
00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:01.760
<v Speaker 2>And I remember when I soloed in a cessna</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was making a turn by myself for</v>

310
00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:07.250
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shadow of the windshield crossed my</v>

311
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I looked up with a great start</v>

312
00:17:10.521 --> 00:17:14.270
<v Speaker 2>thinking something was coming at me with</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the shadow of the windshield.</v>

313
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.380
<v Speaker 2>I was so afraid of what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was up at the year 1500 feet.</v>

314
00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:21.530
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if you panic,</v>

315
00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 2>god knows what'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you need like a test pilot to control</v>

316
00:17:26.661 --> 00:17:29.930
<v Speaker 2>that panic and like an athlete and a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

317
00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.380
<v Speaker 2>use it so that you.</v>

318
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.510
<v Speaker 2>You extend your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your faculties to,</v>

319
00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.010
<v Speaker 2>to their limit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

320
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.710
<v Speaker 2>Some people can do it by combining the</v>
<v Speaker 2>use of those nerves.</v>

321
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to even face those nerves.</v>

322
00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to focus on what it is I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do and suppress anything else.</v>

323
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Both work I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you talk about ego,</v>

324
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.930
<v Speaker 2>then what this gentleman is describing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ego and and trying to do something</v>

325
00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.940
<v Speaker 2>somebody else has never done or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've never done.</v>

326
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.720
<v Speaker 2>He starts off with ego and the need for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the self confidence and the feeling that</v>

327
00:18:07.051 --> 00:18:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he paints a picture of somebody</v>

328
00:18:11.101 --> 00:18:15.530
<v Speaker 2>who was so egotistical that he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to anybody else like at a you.</v>

329
00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch your ego because you're about to</v>

330
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:20.160
<v Speaker 2>step off the precedent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might say,</v>

331
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

332
00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:23.930
<v Speaker 2>that's where the precipice is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can still be filled with ego.</v>

333
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.750
<v Speaker 2>I've got the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got the kite in my hands and I'm</v>

334
00:18:27.751 --> 00:18:30.960
<v Speaker 2>going to step off the precipice there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just point me to where the precipice is</v>

335
00:18:30.961 --> 00:18:34.500
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've got the ego that I will sell</v>

336
00:18:34.501 --> 00:18:36.660
<v Speaker 2>this kite in space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

337
00:18:36.661 --> 00:18:39.660
<v Speaker 2>but just to help me with the help they</v>
<v Speaker 2>get to the precipice.</v>

338
00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.390
<v Speaker 2>You can have the ego and overwhelming</v>
<v Speaker 2>over weaning ego.</v>

339
00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.510
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

340
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:50.510
<v Speaker 2>what kind of a mind would get in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spaceship and go to mars for the first</v>

341
00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:53.220
<v Speaker 2>time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who would do that?</v>

342
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Except somebody who thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if I live or die,</v>

343
00:18:57.391 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make this adventure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reAlity of the columbus sailing a</v>

344
00:19:01.441 --> 00:19:05.220
<v Speaker 2>ship over the edge of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that he knew the earth</v>

345
00:19:05.221 --> 00:19:07.080
<v Speaker 2>was curved or he heard the earth was</v>
<v Speaker 2>covered,</v>

346
00:19:07.081 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 2>but there were many of us crew who</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought the earth was flat.</v>

347
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:12.720
<v Speaker 2>You sell long enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fall over the edge.</v>

348
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 2>They were on the edge of a precipice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They thought,</v>

349
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.780
<v Speaker 2>or certainly columbus thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>screw it.</v>

350
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm going forward and I'm taking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>risk of all these other people's lives</v>

351
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:26.220
<v Speaker 2>because I think we're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the spices</v>

352
00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.410
<v Speaker 1>and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what I wanted to get at.</v>

353
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:31.470
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he said was that you know you</v>

354
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't overestimate your ability,</v>

355
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:39.840
<v Speaker 1>but when you are going into the unknown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what's going to happen.</v>

356
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.520
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even need a grand adventure.</v>

357
00:19:43.770 --> 00:19:46.400
<v Speaker 2>What about a relatIonship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you think didn't go well?</v>

358
00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask that girl for a date,</v>

359
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.590
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're shy,</v>

360
00:19:51.591 --> 00:19:55.580
<v Speaker 2>if you're basic nature is shy and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel unworthy and she's so pretty and</v>

361
00:19:55.581 --> 00:19:59.000
<v Speaker 2>she's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that that's above and you</v>

362
00:19:59.001 --> 00:20:04.001
<v Speaker 2>suppress all that and you venture out</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto this flat earth of the edge of a</v>

363
00:20:04.221 --> 00:20:06.170
<v Speaker 2>precipice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to ask for a date.</v>

364
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to suppress all those feelings</v>

365
00:20:09.891 --> 00:20:12.640
<v Speaker 2>of inferiority and and think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

366
00:20:12.641 --> 00:20:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this to,</v>

367
00:20:14.850 --> 00:20:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that people,</v>

368
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:23.020
<v Speaker 1>that anybody gets married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing as little as anybody else knows</v>

369
00:20:23.021 --> 00:20:26.380
<v Speaker 1>about anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when at the point at which they get</v>

370
00:20:26.381 --> 00:20:28.420
<v Speaker 1>married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how well they know each other,</v>

371
00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:30.220
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know anything.</v>

372
00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:34.580
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They and I'm,</v>

373
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of your funeral authorities who</v>
<v Speaker 2>can attest to that very fact.</v>

374
00:20:38.850 --> 00:20:43.500
<v Speaker 2>You don't know anybody that you marry</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you've been married a length of</v>

375
00:20:43.501 --> 00:20:44.334
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

376
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:48.010
<v Speaker 2>Even then strange aspects revealed.</v>

377
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I mean,</v>

378
00:20:49.641 --> 00:20:54.641
<v Speaker 1>to go into that kind of adventure which</v>
<v Speaker 1>people do over and over again certainly</v>

379
00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.740
<v Speaker 1>requires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not ego,</v>

380
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.410
<v Speaker 1>at least some kind of suspension of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disbelief.</v>

381
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:01.000
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

382
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

383
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:05.650
<v Speaker 2>now you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the area of suspension of</v>

384
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:08.710
<v Speaker 2>disbelief that you're okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do this,</v>

385
00:21:08.711 --> 00:21:12.370
<v Speaker 2>this is worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And your mother and father say a son,</v>

386
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:14.770
<v Speaker 2>jason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't marry that girl.</v>

387
00:21:14.790 --> 00:21:16.240
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you say,</v>

388
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.420
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it right.</v>

389
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.320
<v Speaker 2>And your dad says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

390
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:21.550
<v Speaker 2>it's your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

391
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:23.910
<v Speaker 2>don't Come to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

392
00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 2>sometime later you ring your dad and</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

393
00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:27.600
<v Speaker 2>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were right.</v>

394
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

395
00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:32.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe he'll be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he won't,</v>

396
00:21:32.321 --> 00:21:33.154
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

397
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe he'll be watching because he's got</v>
<v Speaker 2>his own prejudices and he doesn't know</v>

398
00:21:37.251 --> 00:21:41.170
<v Speaker 2>this girl anymore than you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see how complex the picture</v>

399
00:21:41.171 --> 00:21:44.540
<v Speaker 2>is without painting a psychopath who</v>
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

400
00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:46.850
<v Speaker 2>don't talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't drive the I know everything.</v>

401
00:21:46.851 --> 00:21:48.280
<v Speaker 2>And I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

402
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:50.990
<v Speaker 2>we've heard some of those psychopaths.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't talk to me.</v>

403
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.280
<v Speaker 2>I'll fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

404
00:21:52.281 --> 00:21:53.114
<v Speaker 2>I alone,</v>

405
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I believe I was listening to just such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychopath two nights.</v>

406
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there you are.</v>

407
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:00.110
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I,</v>

408
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:05.111
<v Speaker 2>I don't admire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are people whose core</v>

409
00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:10.660
<v Speaker 2>knowledge of something is so profound</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they say,</v>

410
00:22:10.661 --> 00:22:12.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what I'm talking about.</v>

411
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.790
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's higher maths or</v>
<v Speaker 2>astrophysics or,</v>

412
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:19.430
<v Speaker 2>or this relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't know what I know and I</v>

413
00:22:19.431 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 2>therefore I'm going ahead with my ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm right and you're wrong.</v>

414
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Those people who have been right and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were wrong.</v>

415
00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:30.940
<v Speaker 2>We're the people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who explored all those new</v>

416
00:22:30.941 --> 00:22:33.430
<v Speaker 2>ventures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the creative,</v>

417
00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.780
<v Speaker 2>productive human beings who've lived</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually,</v>

418
00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:40.810
<v Speaker 2>isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>individually over the generations.</v>

419
00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:45.811
<v Speaker 2>One or two or 10 people in a generation</v>
<v Speaker 2>of made these steps into the unknown</v>

420
00:22:46.481 --> 00:22:48.220
<v Speaker 2>that advised against it by everybody.</v>

421
00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear these kinds of things like</v>

422
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

423
00:22:51.331 --> 00:22:52.770
<v Speaker 1>stanley kubrick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

424
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Who is undeniably one of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>directors.</v>

425
00:22:55.651 --> 00:22:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But allegedly he was just completely.</v>

426
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.020
<v Speaker 1>He map out his entire production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't want to hear from anybody.</v>

427
00:23:04.021 --> 00:23:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Actors were essentIally tools in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands.</v>

428
00:23:07.531 --> 00:23:08.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

429
00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

430
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:12.000
<v Speaker 1>you can stand aside and you can look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and say,</v>

431
00:23:12.001 --> 00:23:14.070
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>

432
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or he might have learned much.</v>

433
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.110
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

434
00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:20.810
<v Speaker 2>but it's not that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a perfect example.</v>

435
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:24.350
<v Speaker 2>A director of a film has the vision,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

436
00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:29.440
<v Speaker 2>And his vision may be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought a law those shoes and you need</v>

437
00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.610
<v Speaker 2>a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to tie the laces on the shoes.</v>

438
00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:34.610
<v Speaker 2>That's my vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The wardrobe person as well,</v>

439
00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.601
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

440
00:23:35.601 --> 00:23:37.520
<v Speaker 2>they're made so that shoe laces are</v>
<v Speaker 2>untIed.</v>

441
00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:42.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My vision is tie the shoe laces as</v>

442
00:23:42.201 --> 00:23:43.310
<v Speaker 2>incidental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>

443
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 2>that's the vision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why that be eager?</v>

444
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why should the wardrobe mistress have a</v>

445
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:51.550
<v Speaker 2>vision that supersede the director?</v>

446
00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's probably true also,</v>

447
00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:58.090
<v Speaker 1>and you've worked with many directors</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have just different styles,</v>

448
00:23:58.091 --> 00:24:00.520
<v Speaker 1>some are more authoritarian and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

449
00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:04.690
<v Speaker 1>and always in charge of everything and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some are probably like,</v>

450
00:24:04.691 --> 00:24:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I know that</v>

451
00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.620
<v Speaker 2>Jason Martin collaborative to do it has</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do with the vision.</v>

452
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A director may have a vision and every</v>

453
00:24:12.611 --> 00:24:16.660
<v Speaker 2>aspect like why would a painter say to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

454
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

455
00:24:17.761 --> 00:24:22.761
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead and dabs of some color on my</v>

456
00:24:22.901 --> 00:24:23.950
<v Speaker 2>painting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

457
00:24:23.951 --> 00:24:25.810
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got the vision.</v>

458
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.740
<v Speaker 2>He's painting the whole picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what that kind of director would</v>

459
00:24:29.741 --> 00:24:31.060
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other directors say,</v>

460
00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:31.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

461
00:24:31.901 --> 00:24:32.621
<v Speaker 2>Tie the shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

462
00:24:32.621 --> 00:24:34.170
<v Speaker 2>don't tell the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm cutting up</v>

463
00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.540
<v Speaker 1>above it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's their vision anyway,</v>

464
00:24:36.541 --> 00:24:37.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

465
00:24:38.370 --> 00:24:39.203
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

466
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.510
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to argue what Is ego and what</v>

467
00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:45.200
<v Speaker 2>does a psychopathic.</v>

468
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

469
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is ego in the healthy sense of sort</v>

470
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.670
<v Speaker 1>of knowing what you're doing and knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>why.</v>

471
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything healthy about ego?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

472
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

473
00:24:57.490 --> 00:24:59.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean it seems so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean.</v>

474
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because most people,</v>

475
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did the first person to say,</v>

476
00:25:03.491 --> 00:25:06.190
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've just come out of the tree,</v>

477
00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.720
<v Speaker 2>let's head north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

478
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:11.730
<v Speaker 2>And the evolution of mankind began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some individuals had.</v>

479
00:25:12.060 --> 00:25:13.160
<v Speaker 2>That's I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

480
00:25:13.161 --> 00:25:16.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of sleeping on the tree here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's lie on the ground.</v>

481
00:25:16.481 --> 00:25:18.280
<v Speaker 2>It seems much more comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

482
00:25:18.281 --> 00:25:21.910
<v Speaker 2>But you'll get eaten.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I'll be alert enough to hear the</v>

483
00:25:21.911 --> 00:25:22.744
<v Speaker 2>tiger.</v>

484
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:25.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called leadership basically.</v>

485
00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:26.150
<v Speaker 1>It's called</v>

486
00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:27.750
<v Speaker 2>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

487
00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.910
<v Speaker 2>And how can you lead with a group of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>

488
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:35.510
<v Speaker 2>It's complex by fred and this guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling us that the ego then leads you</v>

489
00:25:35.881 --> 00:25:39.290
<v Speaker 2>into a psychiatry is as I think,</v>

490
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.590
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorrect.</v>

491
00:25:40.591 --> 00:25:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's leave it at that assessment and</v>

492
00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:48.291
<v Speaker 1>let's move on since our time is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a little limited to the next surprise</v>

493
00:25:48.451 --> 00:25:50.850
<v Speaker 1>video and that's nickeel go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

494
00:25:50.851 --> 00:25:52.950
<v Speaker 1>he's an educatIon expert.</v>

495
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:54.063
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

496
00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.870
<v Speaker 5>The statistics show that bullying is a</v>
<v Speaker 5>major,</v>

497
00:26:01.871 --> 00:26:06.430
<v Speaker 5>major problem in most american schools</v>
<v Speaker 5>and what they find is that in school</v>

498
00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.880
<v Speaker 5>schools have a number of different</v>
<v Speaker 5>qualities and one of them is the</v>

499
00:26:09.881 --> 00:26:12.000
<v Speaker 5>antidemocratic governing structure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

500
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:13.540
<v Speaker 5>if you look in most american high</v>
<v Speaker 5>schools,</v>

501
00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:16.450
<v Speaker 5>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they are a gargantuan mammoth</v>

502
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.180
<v Speaker 5>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They have thousands upon thousands of</v>

503
00:26:19.181 --> 00:26:20.310
<v Speaker 5>kids,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

504
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.650
<v Speaker 5>walking through the hallways every day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

505
00:26:23.651 --> 00:26:25.870
<v Speaker 5>and what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what happens as a result of this,</v>

506
00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:29.410
<v Speaker 5>and this is not necessarily the fault of</v>
<v Speaker 5>teachers or even just the people in that</v>

507
00:26:29.411 --> 00:26:32.710
<v Speaker 5>school building.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you have such a large student body</v>

508
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.800
<v Speaker 5>and you don't have a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have large class sizes.</v>

509
00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:39.130
<v Speaker 5>There's not enough time for students and</v>
<v Speaker 5>teachers to have really strong,</v>

510
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.860
<v Speaker 5>authentic and genuine relationships and</v>
<v Speaker 5>students.</v>

511
00:26:41.861 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 5>Basically what happens is they don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have any relationships with fellow peers</v>

512
00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:49.170
<v Speaker 5>and students that are really rich and</v>
<v Speaker 5>authentic level.</v>

513
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.940
<v Speaker 5>And so when students feel that they have</v>
<v Speaker 5>no power or no agency in their school</v>

514
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:56.340
<v Speaker 5>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what often happens is something called</v>

515
00:26:56.341 --> 00:26:59.220
<v Speaker 5>clicks arise.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If students feel that they have to wield</v>

516
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:03.120
<v Speaker 5>power and get control within themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>and within their ranks,</v>

517
00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:07.170
<v Speaker 5>and so clicks are one of the major</v>
<v Speaker 5>phenomenons in american schools where</v>

518
00:27:07.171 --> 00:27:10.620
<v Speaker 5>they create basically power structures</v>
<v Speaker 5>within the student body of themselves.</v>

519
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:18.000
<v Speaker 1>I actually Want to start in a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>oblique way and then come to the bigger</v>

520
00:27:18.001 --> 00:27:20.100
<v Speaker 1>ideas here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to start with like,</v>

521
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:23.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us take a trip in the wayback</v>

522
00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:26.520
<v Speaker 1>machine to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you were a kid where they're</v>

523
00:27:26.521 --> 00:27:28.860
<v Speaker 1>bullIes in your school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were you a bully?</v>

524
00:27:28.861 --> 00:27:30.170
<v Speaker 1>Were you bullied?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there,</v>

525
00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:33.060
<v Speaker 1>was that a thing in your that you dealt</v>
<v Speaker 1>with?</v>

526
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.871
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

527
00:27:33.871 --> 00:27:35.950
<v Speaker 2>you want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to bring this specifically?</v>

528
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:38.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>

529
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And bullying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to start.</v>

530
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I just find that it's sometimes</v>

531
00:27:42.231 --> 00:27:45.230
<v Speaker 1>helpful to go from the particular to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>general and it,</v>

532
00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.300
<v Speaker 1>and a little more colorful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to.</v>

533
00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

534
00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:52.120
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I went to a grade school and maybe</v>

535
00:27:52.121 --> 00:27:55.540
<v Speaker 2>even as far as high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was brought up in montreal,</v>

536
00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:56.374
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

537
00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:01.470
<v Speaker 2>And I'm jewish and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being jewish in the miller that I was in</v>

538
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.280
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an unusual and so I was attacked</v>

539
00:28:06.281 --> 00:28:11.090
<v Speaker 2>a lot as a kid for being jewish and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>had flights every day.</v>

540
00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It was more than one guy at a time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crowds of kids gathered around yelling,</v>

541
00:28:16.121 --> 00:28:16.721
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>

542
00:28:16.721 --> 00:28:18.970
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd be the one in the fight trying</v>

543
00:28:18.971 --> 00:28:22.780
<v Speaker 2>to handle one if not two and sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 2>three kids my size,</v>

544
00:28:22.781 --> 00:28:27.781
<v Speaker 2>my age and I had fights all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one bully I remember in particular</v>

545
00:28:28.811 --> 00:28:33.700
<v Speaker 2>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were places where coal was dumped</v>

546
00:28:33.701 --> 00:28:38.560
<v Speaker 2>into the furnaces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they were raised like two feet above</v>

547
00:28:38.561 --> 00:28:43.561
<v Speaker 2>the ground and so they provided a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe four foot square that was like a</v>

548
00:28:44.051 --> 00:28:47.200
<v Speaker 2>crowning place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody would stand on this and be</v>

549
00:28:47.201 --> 00:28:49.870
<v Speaker 2>the bully and then they try and get you</v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

550
00:28:49.871 --> 00:28:53.230
<v Speaker 2>That was part of the game to see you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could stand on the highest place,</v>

551
00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500
<v Speaker 2>the longest part of a bullying campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's my experience about being</v>

552
00:28:59.411 --> 00:29:02.230
<v Speaker 2>bullied.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was bullied all the time.</v>

553
00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

554
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just looking back,</v>

555
00:29:04.381 --> 00:29:05.550
<v Speaker 1>do you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

556
00:29:05.551 --> 00:29:07.590
<v Speaker 1>not that anyone would wish that on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

557
00:29:07.591 --> 00:29:11.340
<v Speaker 1>but did you become like tough as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of that or was that.</v>

558
00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

559
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.970
<v Speaker 2>that's an interesting aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

560
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.460
<v Speaker 2>wish on your child is an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>phrase.</v>

561
00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:21.760
<v Speaker 2>You wish only the best for your child</v>
<v Speaker 2>kindness agonists,</v>

562
00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.950
<v Speaker 2>ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a softness,</v>

563
00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:25.360
<v Speaker 2>delightful pink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

564
00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.520
<v Speaker 2>lots of food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leonardo soft bed,</v>

565
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.520
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wish they would have that,</v>

566
00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.970
<v Speaker 2>but what does that make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

567
00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.390
<v Speaker 2>What kind of a child does that make?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk aBout bullying,</v>

568
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.660
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me you need to look at life</v>
<v Speaker 2>around you.</v>

569
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:45.340
<v Speaker 2>You look at other animals living in</v>
<v Speaker 2>concert with each other.</v>

570
00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.520
<v Speaker 2>Look at a wolf pack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every social animal that I can think of.</v>

571
00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:54.900
<v Speaker 2>Chimpanzees as close to human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apes,</v>

572
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:58.750
<v Speaker 2>all the great apes in concert.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they live in concert,</v>

573
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:04.110
<v Speaker 2>there's one or two alpha males or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in elephants.</v>

574
00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.800
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's a matriarchal and the alpha</v>
<v Speaker 2>female and they alone,</v>

575
00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.450
<v Speaker 2>at least in the wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they alone breed and their children are</v>

576
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:15.400
<v Speaker 2>alpha children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they're handled.</v>

577
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Even the insects bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of it most maybe all aspects of</v>

578
00:30:22.691 --> 00:30:25.750
<v Speaker 2>life living together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a dominant individual,</v>

579
00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:30.240
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't we have to say that like humans,</v>

580
00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:34.320
<v Speaker 1>while we are like other pieces were</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiated by the fact that we have</v>

581
00:30:34.321 --> 00:30:37.290
<v Speaker 1>a prefrontal cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we organized into societies,</v>

582
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.500
<v Speaker 1>we have the option to make decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We organized into societies in which</v>

583
00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:46.680
<v Speaker 1>there's a lead elect them or their</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointed or they assuming there's,</v>

584
00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.600
<v Speaker 1>there are leaders and there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>followers.</v>

585
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Do the leaders achieve leadership by</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullying that?</v>

586
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:57.050
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is that we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

587
00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:00.830
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to organize things as</v>

588
00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:04.580
<v Speaker 1>killer be killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are different from other animals</v>

589
00:31:04.581 --> 00:31:05.870
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

590
00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.570
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I are not going out every day</v>

591
00:31:08.571 --> 00:31:11.960
<v Speaker 1>and like ms dot shetty and people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are humans that are doing</v>

592
00:31:11.961 --> 00:31:13.120
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

593
00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but how did you get this podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

594
00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:18.510
<v Speaker 1>not by machete,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

595
00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 1>not literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did you push somebody aside who</v>

596
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:23.410
<v Speaker 1>might've had a podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

597
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not literally,</v>

598
00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.740
<v Speaker 1>but I've just literally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But somebody could have had a job,</v>

599
00:31:29.741 --> 00:31:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but you got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

600
00:31:30.761 --> 00:31:31.361
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

601
00:31:31.361 --> 00:31:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good point.</v>

602
00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love making a good point.</v>

603
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:36.170
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

604
00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>

605
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:40.060
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to what he was saying in</v>

606
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:45.061
<v Speaker 1>terms of power structures and how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>create</v>

607
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.460
<v Speaker 1>bullying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean regardless of whether we think</v>

608
00:31:48.461 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 1>that this is a natural.</v>

609
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not regardless.</v>

610
00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:53.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

611
00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.740
<v Speaker 2>The point is it seems to be a natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolvement evolution in,</v>

612
00:31:59.830 --> 00:32:03.520
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a group that if the group has to do</v>

613
00:32:03.521 --> 00:32:07.010
<v Speaker 2>something other than just sit around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go into the ocean and,</v>

614
00:32:07.011 --> 00:32:09.670
<v Speaker 2>and toast marshmallows by the campfire</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

615
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.490
<v Speaker 2>but then somebody brought the</v>
<v Speaker 2>marshmallows and somebody made the</v>

616
00:32:12.491 --> 00:32:17.260
<v Speaker 2>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in every group that needs to go to do</v>

617
00:32:17.261 --> 00:32:18.670
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go someplace,</v>

618
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.310
<v Speaker 2>there's always a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go there now let's go.</v>

619
00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go seven steps in that direction.</v>

620
00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.753
<v Speaker 2>See what happens.</v>

621
00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess where I guess where I want to</v>

622
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:29.990
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not debating.</v>

623
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:31.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean I guess where I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where I,</v>

624
00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.990
<v Speaker 1>where we are different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well where I differ is maybe we are.</v>

625
00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Where I differ is just using the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>defer differ william.</v>

626
00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.190
<v Speaker 1>We are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a zero sum game.</v>

627
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Like we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's keeping score,</v>

628
00:32:45.621 --> 00:32:46.454
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

629
00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:47.750
<v Speaker 1>that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

630
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to win the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Are.</v>

631
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So know what I'm saying is like</v>

632
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.500
<v Speaker 1>leadership and bullying aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily the same thing.</v>

633
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

634
00:32:58.670 --> 00:32:59.503
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

635
00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.650
<v Speaker 2>leadership and bullying are not the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

636
00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:05.380
<v Speaker 2>So where do you go?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you,</v>

637
00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:08.470
<v Speaker 2>where do you work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you mitigate all those things?</v>

638
00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:11.950
<v Speaker 2>So let me tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I think about that.</v>

639
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:17.520
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to teach from birth on</v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy.</v>

640
00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:23.710
<v Speaker 2>we need to teach the ability from one</v>
<v Speaker 2>human being to the other to place</v>

641
00:33:23.711 --> 00:33:28.570
<v Speaker 2>yourself in that person's running shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baby shoes,</v>

642
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:34.180
<v Speaker 2>spikes writing shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to everybody to say,</v>

643
00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:39.270
<v Speaker 2>listen to what this person is saying and</v>
<v Speaker 2>crying out for help to be listened to.</v>

644
00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Look at my experience here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at what you've trIed on my toes and</v>

645
00:33:45.341 --> 00:33:48.100
<v Speaker 2>that hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me explain to you this hurt.</v>

646
00:33:48.101 --> 00:33:53.101
<v Speaker 2>You've crushed my toes and that hurts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I don't want to hurt you.</v>

647
00:33:53.471 --> 00:33:56.050
<v Speaker 2>And norman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm not incapable of hurting you,</v>

648
00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:01.350
<v Speaker 2>but listen to how I'm hurting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe you don't do it again and you</v>

649
00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:06.420
<v Speaker 2>teach empathy to children because</v>
<v Speaker 2>empathy may not be natural sympathy</v>

650
00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:12.190
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but empathy to live in somebody else's</v>

651
00:34:12.191 --> 00:34:17.191
<v Speaker 2>mind for a moment and understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely what that other person is</v>

652
00:34:17.861 --> 00:34:21.700
<v Speaker 2>feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is taught and you need to teach</v>

653
00:34:21.701 --> 00:34:25.900
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as a result of that may be aspects</v>

654
00:34:25.901 --> 00:34:28.570
<v Speaker 2>of bullying would dissipate.</v>

655
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:31.360
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there could be more empathetic</v>

656
00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.980
<v Speaker 1>leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

657
00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:38.170
<v Speaker 1>more empathetic leadership which will</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully get after this upcoming</v>

658
00:34:38.171 --> 00:34:39.490
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fingers crossed.</v>

659
00:34:39.491 --> 00:34:42.850
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm william shatner.</v>

660
00:34:42.851 --> 00:34:46.570
<v Speaker 1>It has been great talking to you and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we'll leave it there because we</v>

661
00:34:46.571 --> 00:34:51.460
<v Speaker 1>are almost out of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a zero g zero g is the new book.</v>

662
00:34:51.490 --> 00:34:54.760
<v Speaker 1>It is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting and exciting.</v>

663
00:34:54.761 --> 00:34:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's set in the 20 slash 25 slash 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

664
00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:01.310
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

665
00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.700
<v Speaker 1>it's all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a few years difference.</v>

666
00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm being empathetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being an empathetic leader.</v>

667
00:35:06.791 --> 00:35:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>

668
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Did I understand you made a mistake in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2025 but it's really 20 slash 50 but not</v>

669
00:35:14.621 --> 00:35:15.970
<v Speaker 1>to worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with you.</v>
