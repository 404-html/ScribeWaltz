00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>I do occasionally worry about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>academic world,</v>

2
00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.334
<v Speaker 1>or at least parts of the academic world </v>
<v Speaker 1>being really mired in what some friends </v>

3
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>of mine and I tend to call the cult of </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevance.</v>

4
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.323
<v Speaker 1>This idea of wanting to work on topics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are of great interest to you and </v>

5
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.020
<v Speaker 1>three of your friends and to people at </v>
<v Speaker 1>another university.</v>

6
00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is an abdication of our</v>

7
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.224
<v Speaker 1>responsibility as intellectuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should be grappling with really big </v>

8
00:00:31.231 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>questions as much as we can and </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that are of great importance,</v>

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.593
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why society allows us to have </v>

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:39.654
<v Speaker 1>these very privileged positions as </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals are college professors or </v>

11
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:44.334
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way we should be paying society </v>

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:50.541
<v Speaker 1>back is by using that to try and make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human condition better.</v>

13
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not all going to agree,</v>

14
00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:53.244
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay because we're more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to collectively reach a wise </v>

15
00:00:56.911 --> 00:00:57.744
<v Speaker 1>position if we all think hard and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>argue about it and do so in public </v>

16
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.213
<v Speaker 1>whenever possible.</v>
