1
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I think companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>do to a large degree that makes very</v>

2
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.991
<v Speaker 1>little sense is the use of focus groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so think about what a strange idea is</v>

3
00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:17.151
<v Speaker 1>that we take 10 people who know</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically nothing about your project and</v>

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you put them in a room and you let them</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk for awhile and then you take the</v>

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>whatever they came up with as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of these two hours of random</v>

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>thinking and you base your strategy on</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to a large degree and,</v>

7
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say that focus groups</v>

8
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.400
<v Speaker 1>are always useless and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninformative,</v>

9
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think that taking this data and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then realizing it as extensively as</v>

10
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>companies do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

11
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's crazy in many ways and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason I think companies do it is</v>

12
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:46.710
<v Speaker 1>because when these people create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence or an idea,</v>

13
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:51.711
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe focus group 17 said this and it can</v>

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>help you create a form.</v>

15
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Formulate an idea around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When if you said 87 percent of the</v>

16
00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>people said x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't have a face.</v>

17
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have a desire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not as concrete and therefore</v>

18
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>people are not as excited about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the notion.</v>

19
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>So I think that focus group is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly useful as a persuasive</v>

20
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>attempt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.240
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell people what to do,</v>

22
00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>but as a way to find out information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as useful as people think it</v>

23
00:01:20.131 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that really puzzles me</v>

24
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>is that company is how little they</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand about how incentives really</v>

25
00:01:28.681 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the biggest expenditure for almost</v>

26
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>any company is salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you ask people what do you know</v>

27
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>about the relationship between salaries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and performance?</v>

28
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>The answer is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

29
00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the question is why don't they study</v>

30
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they study,</v>

31
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>why don't they try different</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

32
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 1>different incentive level and see how it</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced a performance.</v>

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>And they often say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>the law kind of low laws and if we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay some people one way and some another</v>

35
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>way we might be sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when the last two years with all</v>

36
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>these questions about bonuses and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gone to many companies and said,</v>

37
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.770
<v Speaker 1>why don't we at least do some surveys?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we at least see how happy</v>

38
00:02:07.771 --> 00:02:10.320
<v Speaker 1>people are on the months when they give</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

39
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>you give them the bonus and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive they are,</v>

40
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>and the answer I got 100 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time is that people are really miserable</v>

41
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>in bold decision and because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to ask them any more</v>

42
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 1>questions and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are miserable in bonuses and</v>

43
00:02:23.371 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't it mean that you should study</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

44
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Speaker 1>understand it and try to prevent it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>next for next year and say,</v>

45
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well not this year.</v>

46
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 1>This year was really miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe next year come back to us next</v>

47
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you think about.</v>

48
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>It's really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now how do companies decided about</v>

49
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>compensation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look at what other companies are</v>

50
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>doing and try to equate compensation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>what other companies are doing it,</v>

51
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>but it's a place of the blind leading</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blind.</v>

52
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if we pay five percent more,</v>

53
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>other people will start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the real question is how do you pay</v>

54
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 1>and how do you get people to care about</v>
<v Speaker 1>their work and become more productive</v>

55
00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>and be happier at their work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is not simply that more</v>

56
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>money is better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more money can be part of the equation,</v>

57
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the question of how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>give that money?</v>

58
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You give it a bonus to give it as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed salary.</v>

59
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you give it as a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits?</v>

60
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you give benefits for the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you send people on vacation to the</v>

61
00:03:15.611 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>Bahamas?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that there are ways to</v>

62
00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>use money that he's cannot make the less</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient,</v>

63
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but actually get people to be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivated,</v>

64
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>caremore and actually become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive.</v>
