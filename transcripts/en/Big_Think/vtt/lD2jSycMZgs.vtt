1
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:12.820
<v Speaker 1>A natural lifespan is probably between</v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>

2
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.070
<v Speaker 1>120 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be about what</v>

3
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>people can handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>it's true that in the United States and</v>
<v Speaker 1>other established market economy,</v>

5
00:00:26.031 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy countries,</v>

6
00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>we spend a tremendous amount of money at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of life.</v>

7
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm one of these people that thinks</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody's life is of equal value.</v>

8
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>The life of an 85 year old is just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>precious as a 12 year old and they are</v>

9
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:46.991
<v Speaker 1>entitled to as many efforts to save</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life as a younger person.</v>

10
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think one can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 12 year old or a 20 year old because</v>

12
00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>they have so much more potential years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead of them.</v>

13
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more valuable as a human being than</v>

14
00:01:00.231 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>someone who's 85.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the other hand,</v>

15
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.400
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to be cognizant that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we spend money for healthcare,</v>

16
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>it should be for healthcare.</v>

17
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we spend money just prolonging</v>

18
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>the dying process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's clearly,</v>

19
00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wrong thing to do,</v>

20
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.650
<v Speaker 1>not just from a financial point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from a human point of view,</v>

21
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>if all we're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is increasing someone's suffering and</v>

22
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:31.721
<v Speaker 1>not really doing anything that can</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully prolong their life in a way</v>

23
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 1>that has value to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think we shouldn't do that.</v>

24
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.700
<v Speaker 1>But it sort of raises a larger issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your question about how we can make the</v>

25
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>population generally healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as everyone knows,</v>

26
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>it's been widely reported.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.280
<v Speaker 1>we spend more money on healthcare in</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

28
00:01:48.281 --> 00:01:51.050
<v Speaker 1>in any other country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't seem to be the healthiest</v>

29
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:56.051
<v Speaker 1>people on Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't live longer than other people.</v>

30
00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we live less long than people in many</v>

31
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>infant mortality in the United States is</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than it is in many countries who</v>

33
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>spend less money on healthcare than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

34
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think we could be getting more out</v>

35
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:16.031
<v Speaker 1>of the money we spend on healthcare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in one of the ways to do that is to</v>

36
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>think about public health approaches to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving the health</v>

37
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>of the population of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to point out that frankly,</v>

38
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 1>the person who's done more for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>health of New Yorkers in the last</v>

39
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>several years than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than anyone is the mayor.</v>

40
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's because he's really made it</v>

41
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 1>so difficult to smoke cigarettes in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

42
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.380
<v Speaker 1>It's very expensive and you can't do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public m and a smoking rates have</v>

43
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>dropped quite a bit in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that's a good example of a public health</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to a problem.</v>

45
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.370
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of things affect health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just medicine,</v>

46
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal things,</v>

47
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>economic things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural things,</v>

48
00:02:55.311 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>social things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these things address health impact.</v>

49
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

50
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if we realize that we get a lot</v>

51
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>more out of the money we spend on</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare.</v>
