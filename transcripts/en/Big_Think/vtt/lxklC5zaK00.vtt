1
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.660
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to tell a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has multiple points of view for the</v>

2
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:19.371
<v Speaker 1>very reasons that we've been discussing</v>
<v Speaker 1>and two,</v>

3
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>by doing so indicate on an artistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>level that the old idea of the single,</v>

4
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 1>even the old idea of the single author,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

5
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:36.861
<v Speaker 1>is flawed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it takes ultimately many people</v>

6
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>to tell the story of a community or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>story of a society.</v>

7
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>So that sense of the August author who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come in and speak for women and</v>

8
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>speak for men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that.</v>

9
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe your imagination is sufficient.</v>

10
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

11
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 1>my imagination comes into play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before doing that,</v>

12
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I would like to know how a man feels or</v>
<v Speaker 1>how another woman feels about something.</v>

13
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm studying that because I understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm one human being with a set of</v>

14
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:24.121
<v Speaker 1>experiences that color my lens and I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>always been since I was a little girl,</v>

15
00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 1>very interested in how that person</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the town across the street.</v>

16
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>How did they think and understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could never think likely think,</v>

17
00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>but wanting to try to do something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gap.</v>

18
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>Not even in a humanistic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really something that bothered</v>

19
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:47.860
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really something I worried about.</v>

20
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that by being present as 46</v>

21
00:01:56.621 --> 00:02:01.621
<v Speaker 1>people say in twilight a play about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles riots and playing a Korean</v>

22
00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.790
<v Speaker 1>woman who's store was burned to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground by African Americans or playing</v>

23
00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:11.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the African American kids who</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat up a white man or playing daryl</v>

24
00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:16.000
<v Speaker 1>gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very unpopular a chief of police</v>

25
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>that it suggests to an audience that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to sit in there one</v>

26
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

27
00:02:24.341 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I come out at the end and take my</v>

28
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:27.490
<v Speaker 1>curtain call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still me.</v>

29
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>So did I really lose anything?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No fact.</v>

30
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I gained something.</v>

31
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aesthetically and artistically,</v>

32
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>what I've been trying to contribute is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about details that,</v>

33
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a wider variety of human</v>

34
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:56.101
<v Speaker 1>beings than we've thought about and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can tell compelling stories without</v>

35
00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>having to have those same stereotypes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've thinking about over and over</v>

36
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
<v Speaker 1>so I've been trying to contribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>something about variety that I had hoped</v>

38
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:13.430
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't succeeded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.820
<v Speaker 1>that I hope would change the very nature</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way theater is produced and who</v>

40
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:23.350
<v Speaker 1>comes to the theater because the theater</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a very segregated place.</v>

41
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people who run theaters are</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country are white people.</v>

42
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.090
<v Speaker 1>My generation had many promising</v>
<v Speaker 1>directors and producers and writers and</v>

43
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>they're not around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not making theater.</v>

44
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And it breaks my heart and I feel in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways that</v>

45
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.510
<v Speaker 1>I haven't contributed nearly enough in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of what my thought about that was</v>

46
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>when I first was studying acting in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theater where everybody on the stage was</v>

47
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>white and everybody in the audience was</v>
<v Speaker 1>white.</v>

48
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so weird.</v>

49
00:03:59.651 --> 00:04:04.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Asian people up the hill.</v>

50
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>There's black people across the bay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's every kind of person here.</v>

51
00:04:08.711 --> 00:04:13.711
<v Speaker 1>There's Latinos all over the mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could this theater of this town have</v>

52
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 1>everybody white on the stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless it was a black guy bringing in a</v>

53
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a character,</v>

54
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:22.120
<v Speaker 1>bringing the peace and everybody in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is why?</v>

55
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.190
<v Speaker 1>How could that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

56
00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:24.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made me,</v>

57
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>if I figured out a way to bring more</v>
<v Speaker 1>colors of people onto the stage,</v>

58
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.940
<v Speaker 1>more colors of people come to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

59
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 2>That hasn't happened.</v>

60
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.030
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's so much work yet to be</v>

61
00:04:42.021 --> 00:04:47.021
<v Speaker 1>done in the American theater so that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a cultural form can help mirror the</v>

62
00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.100
<v Speaker 1>magnificent way that this country has</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed since the time I was a girl in</v>

63
00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>Baltimore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't feel it has and it</v>

64
00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:02.240
<v Speaker 1>breaks my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It breaks my heart.</v>
