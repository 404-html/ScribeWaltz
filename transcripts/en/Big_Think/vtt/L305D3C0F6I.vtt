00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>What inspires me</v>

2
00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>making a difference in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving a legacy or making a difference,</v>

3
00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:12.460
<v Speaker 1>having an impact on the lives of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and feeling like,</v>

4
00:00:12.461 --> 00:00:14.110
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life has been worthwhile.</v>

5
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I did have some modest impact on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the people I encountered in this</v>

6
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:19.900
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.040
<v Speaker 1>and leading a life of integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being true to what I believe in</v>

8
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>without compromising that in order to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get ahead.</v>

9
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I look for lessons closest to the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>closest to me from my wife who is my</v>

10
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>partner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

11
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from other leaders who might have known</v>

12
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:37.960
<v Speaker 1>and worked with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a men's group,</v>

13
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:40.630
<v Speaker 1>but I learned a lot from them and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couples group,</v>

14
00:00:40.631 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>but we've been together both them for</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 20 years.</v>

15
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I certainly learned a lot,</v>

16
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also going back to great books and</v>

17
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>learning what others have learned over</v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

18
00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>but how do we bring that forward into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>current day context and watching what</v>

19
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>other leaders are doing and try to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>from them?</v>

20
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.941
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my life,</v>

21
00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:05.450
<v Speaker 1>I've been interested in leaders in part</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was imprinted on me by my father</v>

22
00:01:05.451 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 1>who thought he should have been a leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never was.</v>

23
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>And so from a very early age I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading books on great leaders have,</v>

24
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like Abraham Lincoln,</v>

25
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a wide range of leaders.</v>

26
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything I could get my hands on is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>79 year old boy.</v>

27
00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Teaching takes many forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you want to stay with</v>

28
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>teaching leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly we have people teaching is</v>

29
00:01:29.501 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>great things in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

30
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>many forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is leadership I think has been</v>

31
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.910
<v Speaker 1>under appreciated as an area of academic</v>
<v Speaker 1>concentration.</v>

32
00:01:39.911 --> 00:01:43.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we've been too concentrated on</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial management and not enough on</v>

33
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>helping people become better leaders and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating an environment in which they</v>

34
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>could throughout their lifetime and</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach.</v>

35
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Learning them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching them how to learn throughout</v>

36
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>their lifetimes to take on more</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and to lead.</v>

37
00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's been a real vacuum and the</v>

38
00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>teaching of leadership in academic</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions and I think corporations</v>

39
00:02:01.631 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 1>have looked at it too much as</v>
<v Speaker 1>socialization to company.</v>

40
00:02:04.601 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
