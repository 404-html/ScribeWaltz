1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>You know that old saying about the Fox</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarding the hen house.</v>

2
00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>So I like to tell it for a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that story with the</v>

3
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>backstory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>where the hens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular people trying to live our lives</v>

5
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.780
<v Speaker 1>and we had a guard of the hen house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the government wasn't perfect</v>

6
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did a reasonable job of</v>

7
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>protecting us from each other of</v>
<v Speaker 1>guarding equality.</v>

8
00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Make sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making sure none of the hens were</v>

9
00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>pecking the other hands too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then came along last 30,</v>

10
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:40.310
<v Speaker 1>40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fox and the Fox is big business and</v>

12
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:47.571
<v Speaker 1>wealthy people and the Fox didn't like</v>
<v Speaker 1>know the guard because the fox kind of</v>

13
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>one of the hens to itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was what the Fox do it bit by bit</v>

14
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it argued the government was bad,</v>

15
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>government was the enemy had defunded</v>
<v Speaker 1>government at fought for lower taxes so</v>

16
00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:00.930
<v Speaker 1>government could do less stuff.</v>

17
00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Then the guard starts stumbling away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bleeding out</v>

18
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.560
<v Speaker 1>off the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hens are unguarded and the Fox presents</v>

19
00:01:10.561 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>itself to the hands and says what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>

20
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>Government is just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not what it used to be.</v>

21
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not solving and not protecting you,</v>

22
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>not fighting for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So efficient.</v>

23
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gosh,</v>

24
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>that's so sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>let me step in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

26
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.331
<v Speaker 1>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

27
00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm rich and I'm here to help.</v>

28
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich people and wealthy corporations</v>

29
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>spent a generation waging a war on</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

30
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>defunding government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing social problems to fester and</v>

31
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:46.740
<v Speaker 1>allowing their own profits to soar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then with government weekend social</v>

32
00:01:46.741 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>problems multiplying and their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets full,</v>

33
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>they reinvent themselves as the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacement of government,</v>

34
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>instead of trickle down economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now have trickled down,</v>

36
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them make their fortune and you</v>

37
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.930
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they'll just throw some social</v>

38
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>change down from the mountain.</v>

39
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to decide in America,</v>

40
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of change we want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

41
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>but what I do know is if you project</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of change backwards throughout</v>

42
00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:13.590
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't have created most of the</v>

43
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>change that we all take for granted</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

44
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:16.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

45
00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.450
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

47
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>there would frankly have been no new</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>

48
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>There'd be no modern American economy if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had depended on the powerful to throw</v>

49
00:02:25.321 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>down scraps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the most important things in</v>

50
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 1>American life had to be taken from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful and given to the mini.</v>

51
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's time that we reclaim that heritage.</v>

52
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's hard to understand why</v>

53
00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:41.991
<v Speaker 1>populism is rising throughout the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>without reckoning with the role of a</v>

54
00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:47.091
<v Speaker 1>class of global one percenters who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>remote from their communities,</v>

55
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.030
<v Speaker 1>more connected to each other then to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities they live in,</v>

56
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seemingly devoted to profit and</v>

57
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 1>returns above all else.</v>

58
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>The fascinating and complicated thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this global populace moment is</v>

59
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>that it takes very different forms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

60
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>here there's a very strong racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic to it that is at the heart of</v>

61
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>there are other places where that's less</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a factor.</v>

63
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>In some places it's about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>internal racial things and other places</v>
<v Speaker 1>about immigration and some places it's</v>

65
00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:23.071
<v Speaker 1>about all of the above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think what is undeniable in this</v>

66
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:28.141
<v Speaker 1>country is that for 30 or 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people on the left and right have</v>

67
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 1>felt that things were not going right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the country wasn't working for</v>

68
00:03:33.191 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it felt rig to them,</v>

69
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>that it felt impossible to secure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that they were promised by this</v>

70
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

71
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 1>and to give their children something</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than they had.</v>

72
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.810
<v Speaker 1>And that all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there was a lot of rich explaining</v>

73
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:53.310
<v Speaker 1>to those people by the American elite</v>
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>

74
00:03:53.311 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

75
00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.330
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are great trades,</v>

76
00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>good trades going to not non trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade's great cause we perfect.</v>

77
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>So we'll lift everybody up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Globalization.</v>

78
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:01.864
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great.</v>

79
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>Look there's a couple of bumps but no</v>
<v Speaker 1>worries.</v>

80
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And the in the aggregate all will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

81
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean as though anybody lives in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregate,</v>

82
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech don't,</v>

83
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.051
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

84
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about that fact that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>everything got automated in your jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All went to Taiwan.</v>

86
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be better off on the whole.</v>

87
00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And there was just a lot of this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich planning.</v>

88
00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I grew up and I remember studying these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff in college,</v>

89
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>when I took economics classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I went to the University of</v>

90
00:04:26.381 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>Michigan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sitting in Michigan and Econ,</v>

91
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>econ 101 and I remember getting this</v>
<v Speaker 1>lecture on how all this stuff was for</v>

92
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:35.950
<v Speaker 1>the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we'd better off and right around us</v>

93
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>all around us in Michigan in 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state was falling apart these long</v>

94
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:48.361
<v Speaker 1>tectonic shifts where basically like</v>
<v Speaker 1>work was disappearing and trade was not</v>

95
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:50.590
<v Speaker 1>benefiting most people.</v>

96
00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>And globalization was not a walk in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>park and aggregate effects.</v>

97
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:56.950
<v Speaker 1>We're not really have any comfort to</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody.</v>

98
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Speaker 1>And how was it possible at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Michigan in 1999 with all</v>

99
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>of that evidence all around us that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>could sit in an intellectual cocoon and</v>

100
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>explained to ourselves that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.900
<v Speaker 1>rising tides lift all boats essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

102
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.700
<v Speaker 1>there is a way in which American elites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not just a couple of greedy</v>

103
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>hedge fund billionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American,</v>

104
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:24.541
<v Speaker 1>the American intelligentsia also has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been complicit in a false story about</v>

105
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all things working out for people over</v>

106
00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:29.440
<v Speaker 1>the last generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't true.</v>

107
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 1>And I think people felt that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolted against it.</v>

108
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>And it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really unfortunate that particularly in</v>

109
00:05:37.151 --> 00:05:42.151
<v Speaker 1>the trump movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the someone who actually tapped into</v>

110
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>that intuition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have,</v>

111
00:05:44.081 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>that elites weren't maybe as sincere and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting for them as,</v>

112
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:53.340
<v Speaker 1>as they claimed that Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of seizing on that anger and</v>

113
00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 1>channeling at the institutions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who had actually done that</v>

114
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>instead in this cowardly and sad and</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowly and hateful way,</v>

115
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.440
<v Speaker 1>deflected that anger onto Muslims and</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants and women and people of Color</v>

116
00:06:06.441 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>and whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

117
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate and tragic nonsequitor of</v>

118
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.440
<v Speaker 1>American politics today.</v>

119
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>People are correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people correctly feel screwed by an</v>

120
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:22.481
<v Speaker 1>economic order that doesn't have as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>space for regular people to make a life</v>

121
00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:28.540
<v Speaker 1>as it used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have been led by a phony</v>

122
00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>billionaire real estate developer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel as though those problems were</v>

123
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:37.370
<v Speaker 1>caused not by Goldman Sachs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by black people.</v>

124
00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 1>And that is the tragedy of this moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it's going to take</v>

125
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>someone on the democratic side who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually able to speak to the concerns</v>

126
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:53.300
<v Speaker 1>of regular people about being shut out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

127
00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.280
<v Speaker 1>there's more shout out people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic voter base than the</v>

128
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Republican voter base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Democrats I think have struggled</v>

129
00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:08.380
<v Speaker 1>to speak in the language of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel left out by the future.</v>

130
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socially,</v>

131
00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>many of the most prominent Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just they don't know and live among</v>

132
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:17.840
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

133
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 1>you can have a lot of heart and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a good speech writer.</v>

134
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you either live in a world that has</v>

135
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 1>more Goldman Sachs people in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a world that has more union</v>

136
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>organizers in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

137
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just as your real friends,</v>

138
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.370
<v Speaker 1>as your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as your real fellow travelers.</v>

139
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think people are actually good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>sniffing who's who.</v>

140
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Democratic Party needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get serious about being the party of,</v>

141
00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.810
<v Speaker 1>of regular people who feel shut out by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this age and that that must mean not</v>

142
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>being the party of Goldman Sachs in any</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

143
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
