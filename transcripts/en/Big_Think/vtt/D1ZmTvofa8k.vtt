00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 1>That is a challenge and every artist has</v>
<v Speaker 1>to figure out the right balance.</v>

2
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to represent a brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

3
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>that dishonors your name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

4
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>that cheapens you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>but you also know that in this climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with records record sales going down</v>

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>with record label spending a lot less</v>
<v Speaker 1>money on marketing,</v>

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.420
<v Speaker 1>we need to find other marketing partners</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get our music out.</v>

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>And so I've entered into strategic</v>
<v Speaker 1>partnerships with different,</v>

10
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.470
<v Speaker 1>with different brands in order to get my</v>
<v Speaker 1>music out to the people.</v>

11
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And I only do it with brands that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think reflect well on me and that</v>

12
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>respect my fans and my music and want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>put out messages that are consistent</v>

13
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>with music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with,</v>

14
00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>I think the taste of my thing.</v>
