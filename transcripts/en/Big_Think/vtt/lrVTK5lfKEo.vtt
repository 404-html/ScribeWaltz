1
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important</v>

3
00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolving issues.</v>

4
00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Is it face to face confrontation is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

5
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.930
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And far too often things are left to</v>

7
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>other sort of</v>

8
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>others to try to solve what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles should be solving these</v>

9
00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>issues by direct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>interaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>surely it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing lots of things,</v>

12
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems is,</v>

14
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we dwell on the things that aren't</v>

16
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because those are the things we want to</v>

17
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the things we want to correct.</v>

18
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an awful lot that's being done</v>

19
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:32.991
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the last seven years,</v>

20
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City,</v>

21
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a whole different attitude about</v>

22
00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>living in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about working in the city,</v>

23
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.700
<v Speaker 1>about how you interact with people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know.</v>

24
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that has to do with just a change of</v>

25
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 1>how things are done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.853
<v Speaker 1>both the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>from the public perspective as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a private perspective.</v>

28
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an architect,</v>

29
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>I can't say there's been a great deal of</v>
<v Speaker 1>good architecture,</v>

30
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

31
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a resident in this city.</v>

32
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>But there's a different attitude about</v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture in this city than ever</v>

33
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with a feeling this is our</v>

34
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'd be great.</v>

35
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's that never existed</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

36
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>So how do we cope now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're beyond that.</v>

37
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
