1
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.040
<v Speaker 1>Now one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no program,</v>

2
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 1>he's actually that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like as far as developed</v>

3
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>developing programming environments mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>it's really made it a lot easier for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to make you know,</v>

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 1>sites like what 2.0 type sites then then</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been five years ago.</v>

6
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I was saying,</v>

7
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>like when the cost of production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ease production,</v>

8
00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 1>the democratization of production has</v>
<v Speaker 1>really come down.</v>

9
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:31.774
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>something that like this sort of idea of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like democratization of production is,</v>

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that like all mediums,</v>

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>all media are having trouble with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.600
<v Speaker 1>and that to me is like the real story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the Internet but about like the</v>

15
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>shift from analog to digital is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing it becoming with each</v>

16
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>passing year cheaper and cheaper and</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier and easier for anyone to produce</v>

17
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.290
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's like,</v>

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a TV show or a radio show or a podcast</v>

19
00:01:00.881 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 1>or music to make their own music or</v>
<v Speaker 1>create their own,</v>

20
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:03.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>

21
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.300
<v Speaker 1>newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

22
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these things that are,</v>

23
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it's become so cheap and easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you couple that with basically</v>

24
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>the world's most frictionless</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution mechanism that,</v>

25
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for,</v>

26
00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these media companies which thrived in</v>

28
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>the age of mechanical production or</v>
<v Speaker 1>reproduction.</v>

29
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I read a lot of valter venue me and</v>

30
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>like I know all about this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard for them to really thrive in</v>

32
00:01:29.621 --> 00:01:32.110
<v Speaker 1>that environment and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

33
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably should've started</v>

35
00:01:35.171 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>cannibalizing their businesses five</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

36
00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be too late for a lot of</v>

37
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I'm getting,</v>

38
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something with music,</v>

39
00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 1>which sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is crazy.</v>

40
00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no reason why anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>should get into music business now.</v>

41
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that like,</v>

42
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of betting that by doing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this extremely low,</v>

43
00:01:52.061 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage and recognizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:56.980
<v Speaker 1>these shifts that like we can do stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cheaply,</v>

45
00:01:56.981 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 1>very efficiently and that we don't need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's like a record label with like</v>

46
00:02:01.151 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>literally without 99% of the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

47
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>But just like keeping the 1% that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually valuable.</v>

48
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more that it's an evolution.</v>

49
00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are people that I became</v>

50
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:21.321
<v Speaker 1>friends with on prodigy then I'm still</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with now and that was 1988 or 89</v>

51
00:02:21.781 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>that I became friends with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

52
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's funny that they reconnected</v>

53
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:31.221
<v Speaker 1>with me through my space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just kind of funny how that all</v>

54
00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:33.540
<v Speaker 1>works out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

55
00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot,</v>

56
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stuff on the internet is not</v>

57
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a difference in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

58
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.840
<v Speaker 1>it's not a quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like why annotated Lee</v>

59
00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.170
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>

60
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not qualitative to the different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of quantitatively different.</v>

61
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like an evolution of something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened before and,</v>

62
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>and because of broadband and</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements and web based technology,</v>

63
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make the experience better and</v>

64
00:02:53.071 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 1>you can facilitate it and make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

65
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>a lot smoother.</v>

66
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

67
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

68
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 1>you could have done youtube years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less,</v>

69
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what made it possible was,</v>

70
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadband and so it changed it.</v>

71
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Broadband really changes the way people</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact,</v>

72
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes,</v>

74
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>it changes the way people interact with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet because it means a lot of</v>

75
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>things that were too frustrating to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

76
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:17.770
<v Speaker 1>like download video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

77
00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't want spend a lot of time on</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook of facebook if every time,</v>

78
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wanted to click on a profile page,</v>

79
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>you have to wait a minute for it to load</v>
<v Speaker 1>and defeats the purpose.</v>

80
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially young people on facebook and</v>

81
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>my space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll spend,</v>

82
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 1>we'll look at like 60 or 70 pages in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>session.</v>

83
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.710
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that can happen really</v>

85
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only that they actually do want,</v>

86
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>they actually will do.</v>
