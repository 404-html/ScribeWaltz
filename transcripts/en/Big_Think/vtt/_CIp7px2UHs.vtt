00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing right?</v>

2
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 2>The key thing the irs is doing wrong in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of energy policy overall,</v>

3
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>I think he's letting congress mandate</v>
<v Speaker 2>foolish,</v>

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 2>foolish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 2>legislation like the ethanol scam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the congress in,</v>

6
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:29.211
<v Speaker 2>in December of 2007 passed the energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>independence and security act of 2007</v>

7
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:33.930
<v Speaker 2>and in doing so mandated the production</v>
<v Speaker 2>of 36 billion gallons of ethanol by</v>

8
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 2>2022.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not going to happen.</v>

9
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.291
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

10
00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean that what they have done is</v>
<v Speaker 2>mandate the creation of a huge amount of</v>

11
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 2>motor fuel that the market cannot</v>
<v Speaker 2>supply.</v>

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 2>But what is also happening is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are increasing demand for corn and</v>

13
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 2>thereby and therefore other grains and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's causing enormous amounts of</v>

14
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 2>inflation in food prices and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hurting consumers all over the country.</v>

15
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 2>So I think what the u s has been doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong with regard to energy policy is</v>

16
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 2>allowing Congress to meddle too much in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market and mandate certain solutions</v>

17
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 2>that are not economic and are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>helpful.</v>

18
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the US doing?</v>

19
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:08.784
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have to think about that one</v>

21
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 2>because there are no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no answers that come to mind.</v>

22
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've really,</v>

23
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

24
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 2>the mistake that we are making as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to the ethanol is relying on</v>

25
00:01:21.571 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 2>militarism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The U S has really,</v>

26
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 2>since the 1970s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in particular,</v>

27
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 2>had an approach to energy security that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 2>and that requires wrongly over</v>
<v Speaker 2>militarization of the Persian Gulf,</v>

29
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 2>which I think has been a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had very deleterious effects on the u s</v>

30
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second Iraq war was,</v>

31
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 2>no matter how you slice it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in fact about controlling the flow</v>

32
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 2>of oil out of Iraq and resting the</v>
<v Speaker 2>control of Iraqi oil from Saddam</v>

33
00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 2>Hussein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

34
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 2>other countries around the world have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

35
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.560
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have turned to the marketplace.</v>

36
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 2>They are not using militarism as a way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

37
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to assure energy supply and they</v>

38
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 2>are thriving and we're going bankrupt.</v>

39
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
