00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the community and the</v>

2
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>loving and the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the care that you can get from religion</v>

3
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>are very good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

4
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>And if only there were more purely</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular groups that provided not only</v>

5
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>the good works but also the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be a good thing.</v>

6
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been talking with various people</v>

7
00:00:33.571 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>about the need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>provide that structure in secular</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and I think it's possible</v>

9
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>and I think we should work at it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

10
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>People sometimes when there's nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>around to love you and take care of you.</v>

11
00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>It's great to have a group that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be welcomed into.</v>

12
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the simplest answer is it</v>

13
00:00:58.711 --> 00:01:03.711
<v Speaker 1>would be good if there were a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are already a churches without</v>

14
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>dogmas and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.020
<v Speaker 1>more and more churches downplay dogma to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point of evaporation and concentrate</v>

16
00:01:15.991 --> 00:01:19.400
<v Speaker 1>on providing just the sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>a community of care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mutual care and,</v>

18
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and I'm helping the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's entirely possible</v>

19
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:32.721
<v Speaker 1>that churches will evolve into sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creedless organizations that do a lot of</v>

20
00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>good work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be wonderful.</v>
