1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>There are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginnings of an intellectual</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>revulsion at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at what conservatives,</v>

3
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>what has been done to conservatism as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>governing philosophy in America.</v>

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think one of the roles of the day,</v>

5
00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.941
<v Speaker 1>the dishes now trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play is to be a place where those</v>

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>voices can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be brought to a wider audience.</v>

7
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.600
<v Speaker 1>So I think of Bruce Bartlett who along</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me in the early part of the Bush</v>

8
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>called them out on that fiscal</v>

9
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>irresponsibility is a voice that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy to,</v>

10
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to keep bringing.</v>

11
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I think a much later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like David Frum has come to that</v>

12
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>recognition even though I think we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>still going to disagree about foreign</v>

13
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

14
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some libertarian voices that</v>

15
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>are out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>and I think a younger generation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasoned people I think of,</v>

17
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.270
<v Speaker 1>I think of people like Damon linker.</v>

18
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people out there.</v>

20
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately what's happened in</v>

21
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Washington and more generally is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservative movement is bankrolled</v>

22
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>by certain large donors and with certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming interests.</v>

23
00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they police the discourse with a</v>

24
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:26.121
<v Speaker 1>ferocity and a lockstep mentality that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has frozen conservatism as a,</v>

25
00:01:27.211 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a philosophy in place.</v>

26
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turned it into an ideology that kind</v>

27
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>of ever change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>or Alijah it with such fundamentalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>concepts that there can be no real</v>

29
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>conservative dialogue because dialogue</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not what fundamentalism is about.</v>

30
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the price of lip simply existing as</v>

31
00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conservative in Washington to be in</v>

32
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:59.421
<v Speaker 1>good standing is to obey the dictates of</v>
<v Speaker 1>whichever this constellation of donors</v>

33
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>and organizations from heritage to Aei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>to even something like pajamas media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is apparently financed by people</v>

35
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>who are also financing West Bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements.</v>

36
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if,</v>

37
00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>if you stray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are expelled.</v>

38
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>And then also thoroughly demonized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So intellectually we are,</v>

39
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the blogosphere allows these kinds of</v>

40
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.130
<v Speaker 1>ideas to percolate and I mean kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fritos door for example,</v>

41
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>is a young conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>whom I've brought on specifically with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mandate of because find and courage</v>

43
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 1>let us bring to light young writers</v>
<v Speaker 1>right of center who are not yet,</v>

44
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>have not been yet basically bought by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this establishment.</v>

45
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And then coerced to certain positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Larson is another person.</v>

46
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Now these people don't normally agree by</v>
<v Speaker 1>any means.</v>

47
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>but they do not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

49
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 1>they have acknowledged that conservatism</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past 10,</v>

50
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years.</v>

51
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not that there was a great period</v>
<v Speaker 1>of pure,</v>

52
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.070
<v Speaker 1>great conservatives and we've never had</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

53
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>some of these populist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>xenophobic,</v>

54
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigoted strains.</v>

55
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.100
<v Speaker 1>It's that that was always there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>it is that there was also a lot of good</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff there that we were responding to</v>

57
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.750
<v Speaker 1>contingent situations such as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse of the social democracy model</v>

58
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>in the 1970s and a really smart critique</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the welfare state.</v>

59
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>And a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

60
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 1>critical insight into how one defeats</v>
<v Speaker 1>solving communism.</v>

61
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happened is that all that stuff</v>

62
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>has slowly been marginalized and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst has come to the surface.</v>

63
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

64
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>that won't change overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think from everything we're seeing</v>

65
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.820
<v Speaker 1>talk radio and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.300
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think essentially corrupting</v>

67
00:04:04.301 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>institutions in Washington are turning</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservatism into something that really</v>

68
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 1>very creepy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also emotionally and psychically</v>

69
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:16.111
<v Speaker 1>powerful for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all you do is all you can do is is</v>

70
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>write books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>write articles,</v>

71
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>write blogs that articulate</v>

72
00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.500
<v Speaker 2>what you believe.</v>
