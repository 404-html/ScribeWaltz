00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:14.120
<v Speaker 1>I have a blog and I've actually written</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite a bit on this because you know,</v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.420
<v Speaker 1>if the US capital markets in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication or a 10,</v>

4
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>China's a two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>So China's got a long way to in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital markets in China.</v>

6
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>Like when I went to Wall Street in 1973,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were about as developed as that</v>

7
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>that's a negative in one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that China could learn a lot</v>

10
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>from what's happened over the list of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 days,</v>

11
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to,</v>

12
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever timeframe you want to pick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the US market has gotten so</v>

13
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so big,</v>

14
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>so complicated and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now everybody's scratching their head</v>

15
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:50.131
<v Speaker 1>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

16
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>how do we regulate this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we control it?</v>

17
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>How do we prevent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent this from happening again?</v>

18
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>This gives China a gigantic opportunity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really look at all this would have</v>

19
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>everybody's gonna be analyzing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying about this whole crisis and</v>

20
00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>then to think to themselves about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>they then go about the process of taking</v>

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.490
<v Speaker 1>their capital markets up the curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

22
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>in many ways being the second or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last kid on the block is a lot of times</v>

23
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>an advantage because you get to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>see where everybody else has gone</v>

24
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>through and kind of learn from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

25
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the child would be well</v>
<v Speaker 1>served to really look very,</v>

26
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:29.280
<v Speaker 1>very hard and really try to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>how this all happened and then to think</v>

27
00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>about in the context of China and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means for how China's capital</v>

28
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
