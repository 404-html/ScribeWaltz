1
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I believe in democracy and liberty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can not,</v>

2
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker 1>you can not talk in the name of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>people without elections.</v>

3
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 1>And you cannot supervise the people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says,</v>

4
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.451
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>I am not in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has the roid eh,</v>

6
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say what is good and bad for the</v>

7
00:00:28.791 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They must,</v>

8
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truth for themselves.</v>

9
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a very,</v>

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>very strong idea in the west.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That free elections means in the other</v>

11
00:00:39.771 --> 00:00:41.420
<v Speaker 1>boards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Phonetics in public.</v>

12
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>And this is not true in Egypt is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>

13
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

14
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that we must respect the choice</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the people.</v>

15
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt has,</v>

16
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its first democratic,</v>

17
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience,</v>

18
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

19
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>about that in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

20
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 1>we are not beginning from zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our own experience.</v>

21
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>And as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

22
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 1>it's at risk that you'll have terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>people coming be,</v>

24
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>could be elected any moment there.</v>

25
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.730
<v Speaker 1>But what is very important is how to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to defend the who own a democratic</v>

26
00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

27
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this could be done easily.</v>

28
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I see no point are to support Arab</v>

29
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see and claiming that,</v>

30
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the only choice because,</v>

31
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.150
<v Speaker 1>and I would say even a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>

32
00:01:38.151 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>I would say that because of the Arab</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictators,</v>

33
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>we are having much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>people going to becoming phonetics</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday because,</v>

35
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the WHO would that be?</v>

36
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>The young generations are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 1>allowed to express themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically because the dictatorship</v>

38
00:01:57.591 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>means a total failure in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in every domain.</v>

39
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:06.221
<v Speaker 1>So you'll have more and more desperate</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who could be a turning to a</v>

40
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:10.730
<v Speaker 1>phonetic people at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that,</v>

41
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.180
<v Speaker 1>that the real solution for the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>outer world is a year at the moment.</v>
