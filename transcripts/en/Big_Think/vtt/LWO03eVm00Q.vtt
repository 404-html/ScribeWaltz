1
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>The idea of being a man has a change so</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically.</v>

2
00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>but particularly I think not just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities of a being a father,</v>

4
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>which is always been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 1>not to get all Kahleel Goubran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like these children are on loan to us</v>

6
00:00:29.741 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and we're supposed to make sure that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>take care of them and,</v>

7
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and we're the stewards of these human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings,</v>

8
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>male roles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something I do,</v>

9
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I have written about in the</v>

10
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:49.321
<v Speaker 1>show because the concept of a father</v>
<v Speaker 1>today is dramatically different.</v>

11
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's different in every family</v>

12
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's different from a generation</v>

13
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of what a father's</v>

14
00:01:01.781 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's coparenting,</v>

15
00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a stay at home dad or just</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that does lip service to the</v>

16
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:14.851
<v Speaker 1>idea of sharing responsibility is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>different from 1910 and you know,</v>

17
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.100
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>I have this joke where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go back to caveman and</v>

19
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:26.470
<v Speaker 1>they're literally eating their children.</v>

20
00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perspective on how we treat women,</v>

21
00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the beginning and the ending of</v>

22
00:01:38.621 --> 00:01:40.930
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are animals.</v>

23
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I start from that premise and we choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not behave like animals.</v>

24
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.200
<v Speaker 1>a pretty guiding force through humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it,</v>

26
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.430
<v Speaker 1>it gets completely out of control or</v>
<v Speaker 1>just panting like a dog when a,</v>

27
00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an attractive woman walks by.</v>

28
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I even look at like pornography and all</v>

29
00:02:11.471 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>this stuff where it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

30
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

31
00:02:15.881 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love naked women.</v>

32
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.560
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also know that I'm a visual human</v>

33
00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>being and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can't,</v>

34
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>I can't consume images of naked women</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not have that influence how I view</v>

36
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 1>other women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

37
00:02:39.581 --> 00:02:41.500
<v Speaker 1>that's my personal opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

38
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>so like it's like my sexual desires are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very valid and real.</v>

39
00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>But if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

40
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:53.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.150
<v Speaker 1>followed through on every sexual desire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

42
00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a thousand children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

43
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.831
<v Speaker 1>but I think then that's not how you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not how you get,</v>

44
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't feel very good.</v>

45
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.383
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>when I look at my young sons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

47
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that we love and like the</v>

48
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>normalization of porn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not,</v>

49
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>it's like t each their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that I want my sons</v>
<v Speaker 1>consuming pornography.</v>

52
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.150
<v Speaker 1>I would want my sons to look at an</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertisement and say that is a</v>

53
00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>beautiful woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she's being objectified.</v>

54
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>And I do want even beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally think that,</v>

55
00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States we give credit and</v>

56
00:03:54.911 --> 00:03:59.911
<v Speaker 1>appreciate attractive people too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that I want to instill</v>

57
00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

58
00:04:05.021 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of parents desperately</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have nerdy children.</v>

59
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I dunno,</v>

60
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I want my kids to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my sons to be better men than me.</v>

61
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.030
<v Speaker 1>But I think also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>it's different paths to getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

63
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Catholic.</v>

64
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna think I'm crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's an important tool</v>

65
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also think that,</v>

66
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding the logic and science</v>

67
00:04:34.511 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>behind it is vital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But culturally,</v>

68
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw a clip of match game,</v>

69
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>which was a show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a game show when I was growing up from</v>

70
00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>the mid seventies eighties I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the beginning of the show,</v>

71
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:58.081
<v Speaker 1>it was just filled with the host more or</v>
<v Speaker 1>less sexually harassing the female</v>

72
00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.510
<v Speaker 1>contestants and it was not malicious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that man did not know he was doing it.</v>

73
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>And maybe those women didn't feel icky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But from our standards today,</v>

74
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>it was ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

75
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>I also feel like to discredit everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've said,</v>

76
00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.410
<v Speaker 1>I also think that I don't want us to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point where there isn't passion.</v>

77
00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

78
00:05:25.871 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>when I met my wife and we went on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>first date,</v>

79
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I aggressively kissed,</v>

80
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:37.600
<v Speaker 1>or not in a monstrous way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even hearing myself describe it,</v>

81
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if we could do that today</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure I could have,</v>

82
00:05:42.941 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a communication that's unspoken,</v>

83
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're courting someone but</v>

84
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>courting like it's the 18 hundreds like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're riding a horse to meet them.</v>

85
00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 1>But there is something about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's rules,</v>

86
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:05.201
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so great about relationships is</v>

87
00:06:05.661 --> 00:06:10.661
<v Speaker 1>that tingling feeling when the chemistry</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can't articulate works.</v>

88
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
