1
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I grew up primarily in suburban New</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jersey,</v>

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>not far from New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My parents worked.</v>

3
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think I'm very much a product of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle class to upper middle class</v>

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>suburban environment that I grew up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

5
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 1>in an environment in which a achievement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in school and achievement in,</v>

6
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the professional world beyond school</v>

7
00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high values.</v>

9
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

10
00:00:37.361 --> 00:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>shaped me a tremendous list.</v>

12
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I usually say that I got into journalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the family business,</v>

13
00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my parents met when they were the</v>

14
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 1>success of editors of the undergraduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper at Nyu where they were both a</v>

15
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>commuter students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>my father went on to spend his entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>career in journalism primary with the</v>

17
00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>late great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>New York Herald Tribune and then for 35</v>
<v Speaker 1>years at Time magazine.</v>

19
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>So I grew up carrying a little reporters</v>
<v Speaker 1>pad and pencil in my pocket,</v>

20
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>just imitating my father and as a child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>

21
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>a big adventure was to come into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city from New Jersey to visit him at the</v>

22
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>time and life building and send messages</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the old pneumatic tubes.</v>

23
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 1>And Play Ping Pong in the hallway with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other journalists,</v>

24
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>people who I thought were these exotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>cookie off the wall people.</v>

25
00:01:32.041 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>And I thought it was just the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world that my father worked</v>

26
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>with these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>so as a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just assumed I was going to become a</v>

28
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>journalist because that's what people</v>
<v Speaker 1>did when they got older.</v>

29
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.480
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
