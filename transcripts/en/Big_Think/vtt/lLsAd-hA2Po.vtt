1
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say it was a dilemma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a.</v>

2
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>It was a problem and it was a a not</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncommon problem for a big global</v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>company in the early 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started to do global sourcing and</v>

4
00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:24.160
<v Speaker 1>what that means is you're basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying a either product or sub</v>

5
00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:29.161
<v Speaker 1>assemblies or things that go into</v>
<v Speaker 1>products from companies outside the</v>

6
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.210
<v Speaker 1>United States where you have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>contractual relationship with them.</v>

7
00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>They're not your employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're third parties.</v>

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.110
<v Speaker 1>The question was would we impose ethical</v>
<v Speaker 1>sourcing on those companies and by that</v>

9
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 1>we mean that you make sure that they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>no prisoner child labor,</v>

10
00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>that they had decent environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>

11
00:00:43.811 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>that they had decent wages and decent</v>
<v Speaker 1>working conditions and decent living</v>

12
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the employees in fact lived on the</v>

13
00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:53.680
<v Speaker 1>facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had no legal obligation to do that</v>

14
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>because these were not our facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were not our employees,</v>

15
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>but we decided that we would require</v>
<v Speaker 1>this of our sourcing partners because it</v>

16
00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:06.010
<v Speaker 1>was important to do for at least three</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

17
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were concerned that there might be</v>

18
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>enforcement of law against them which</v>
<v Speaker 1>would stop supply even though</v>

19
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>enforcement in some of these countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>like China is very erratic.</v>

20
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were very concerned about our</v>

21
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 1>employees morale if we had one set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards 50 miles away,</v>

22
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>but allowed much poor standards in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>suppliers.</v>

23
00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>That would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for at least some employees.</v>

24
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Very disconcerting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why were we being so hypocritical?</v>

25
00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>One standard in our plants and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard somewhere else,</v>

26
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 1>especially when those standards could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>very injurious to the public.</v>

27
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the early suppliers I went to in</v>

28
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>China was literally putting mercury from</v>
<v Speaker 1>making light bulbs in the sluice ways</v>

29
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 1>which went into the rice paddies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we of course put a stop to a and</v>

30
00:01:48.911 --> 00:01:51.100
<v Speaker 1>then the third reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in the company that I worked</v>

31
00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:56.101
<v Speaker 1>for is that we were an icon of</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization and one of the criticisms</v>

32
00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.050
<v Speaker 1>of globalization is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>exporting bad practices that you</v>

33
00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do at home.</v>

34
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>So we felt that it was important that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our supply chain we not allow these</v>

35
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:08.980
<v Speaker 1>kinds of bad practices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be an example of a decision</v>

36
00:02:08.981 --> 00:02:12.310
<v Speaker 1>that we made was not required by law</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could call.</v>

37
00:02:12.311 --> 00:02:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It was an ethical decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something beyond what the law requires,</v>

38
00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.160
<v Speaker 1>which we gave a lot of thought to and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very early in the,</v>

39
00:02:18.161 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid nineties,</v>

40
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>started to have a program when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>qualified suppliers that they had to</v>

41
00:02:24.671 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>meet these other conditions involving</v>
<v Speaker 1>child labor,</v>

42
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 1>prison labor environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on.</v>

43
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>Not just that they made good products in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their finances were okay.</v>

44
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>So that would be an example of how you</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason about establishing a global</v>

45
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 1>ethical standard beyond what the law</v>
<v Speaker 1>requires.</v>
