1
00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>Well Bank was created in 1944 before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world war two Sargo was over.</v>

2
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>It was created together with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monetary Fund,</v>

3
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>International Monetary Fund and what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to be late to the WTO,</v>

4
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>the World Trade Organization in the case</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the bank.</v>

5
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its main purpose was to borrow money on</v>

6
00:00:28.691 --> 00:00:33.691
<v Speaker 1>the markets in those days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe more than the u s and to lend</v>

7
00:00:34.751 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>this money for the reconstruction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

8
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 1>of Japan and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was very bold design for the</v>

9
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it did that in the 50s.</v>

10
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Mostly it was in during construction</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

11
00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:53.311
<v Speaker 1>It finance the reconstruction for</v>
<v Speaker 1>instance of Toyota in the in Japan or</v>

12
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 1>the financing for the reconstruction of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French railway system came from</v>

13
00:00:57.791 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in the 60s that preconstruction job</v>

14
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>was over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It went into developing country</v>

15
00:01:05.351 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>lending for hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for highways or ports for agriculture in</v>

17
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>the developing world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting mostly in Latin America and</v>

18
00:01:17.951 --> 00:01:19.210
<v Speaker 1>then going worldwide.</v>

19
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And it really became the World Bank that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is known today under Mcnamara.</v>

20
00:01:26.111 --> 00:01:31.111
<v Speaker 1>And Mcnamara came from the u s</v>
<v Speaker 1>government to become a very famous</v>

21
00:01:31.181 --> 00:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>president of the World Bank in the 70s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made it grow to a much bigger place</v>

22
00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>than it was originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Originally.</v>

23
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:43.531
<v Speaker 1>Ted Let less than a thousand people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington and today it has 12,000</v>

24
00:01:43.931 --> 00:01:48.931
<v Speaker 1>people roughly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he got the World Bank into social</v>

25
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into education,</v>

26
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:53.290
<v Speaker 1>into hell's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into nutrition,</v>

27
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>into what was called basic needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated rural development and so</v>

28
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it became the largest and most,</v>

29
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of broadest development institution</v>

30
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:10.330
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that it is still today,</v>

31
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>even though it's a very much change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot of that work to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

33
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.410
<v Speaker 1>It still operates by borrowing money in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the markets by issuing bonds,</v>

34
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>using the money for very long term</v>
<v Speaker 1>loans,</v>

35
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 1>which all have to do with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>development purpose.</v>

36
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And then when the loans get three</v>
<v Speaker 1>reimbursed by the clients,</v>

37
00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we repaid to bondholders.</v>

38
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the World Bank works for the</v>

39
00:02:36.641 --> 00:02:39.100
<v Speaker 1>very poor countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a special Katie,</v>

40
00:02:39.101 --> 00:02:43.000
<v Speaker 1>which is not based on borrowing money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on donated money.</v>

41
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.770
<v Speaker 1>It's called the International</v>
<v Speaker 1>Development Association window or Idi</v>

42
00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that leads to very long term loans</v>

43
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>without an interest rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 1>or on grand terms for very poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries under roughly a thousand</v>

45
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.040
<v Speaker 1>dollars per person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an institution that's a sort of</v>

46
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>bank in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a sort of financial function,</v>

47
00:03:05.981 --> 00:03:09.730
<v Speaker 1>financing function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also full of people who have a</v>

48
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>lot of knowledge of what works and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work in education and road</v>

49
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.870
<v Speaker 1>surfacing and building latrines in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>textbook,</v>

50
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>publications for schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and cataract operations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

52
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just a money bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a knowledge bank at the same time.</v>

53
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And lately it has become very active</v>
<v Speaker 1>also in a big global issues like global</v>

54
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 1>warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.700
<v Speaker 1>the ozone depletion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>the pollution of the seas and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is still mainly in the poverty</v>

57
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>reduction business and the development</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

58
00:03:47.801 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's beginning to become a presence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the global issues business as well.</v>
