1
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's a little bit about our history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:11.781 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've become so disassociated with</v>

4
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both with the culture of agriculture.</v>

5
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm with agriculture itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are one generation and in some cases</v>

6
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>two generations removed from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you get more and more removed</v>

7
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>from how food is grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

8
00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>who's growing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's coming from,</v>

9
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>how it's getting to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>the easier it is to be completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>disassociated from the decisions about</v>

11
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:39.980
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>so I think part of my job and part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job of stone barns is to say,</v>

13
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:44.234
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>This is part of the pleasures of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are decisions that are being</v>

15
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>made every day by farmers all around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and all around the world.</v>

16
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>And we need to buy into this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as an eater you have a kind of</v>

17
00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.200
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And for some people like chefs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a greater responsibility</v>

19
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>for other people like eaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

20
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it's an everyday thought process to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put your money where your mouth is</v>

21
00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:07.790
<v Speaker 1>and to understand that you're voting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

22
00:01:07.791 --> 00:01:11.150
<v Speaker 1>we're in a political season and we say</v>
<v Speaker 1>we vote every once every four years.</v>

23
00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And so many people get frustrated that</v>
<v Speaker 1>their vote really has no say and Dah,</v>

24
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Dah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dah.</v>

25
00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is an opportunity three times a day</v>

26
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>to vote with your fork and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a huge impact on,</v>

27
00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.540
<v Speaker 1>on how people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

29
00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>supporting food and how food is grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

31
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>that seems to me to be a very positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>message.</v>

32
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:32.561
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

33
00:01:32.561 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>it's one that that could lead again</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

35
00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the flavor,</v>

36
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>with the potential for real pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think people are turned on to that</v>

38
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>and excited by that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

39
00:01:43.161 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're just,</v>

40
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>we're just starting to feel this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wave of interest,</v>

41
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>which hopefully will translate into</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>

42
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.980
<v Speaker 1>like new political reality.</v>
