1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Marriage is always seemed a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic to me,</v>

2
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>the idea that a government gets to</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide whether or not you are married</v>

3
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:14.761
<v Speaker 1>according to a given set of laws or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious authority gets to do so.</v>

4
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this as I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of getting married and</v>

5
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the fact that honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as that paperwork would matter</v>

6
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 1>to the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't really matter much to me or</v>

7
00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>to my future wife.</v>

8
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to find a way to get married</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was deeper,</v>

9
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>that was more universal than whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of legal framework could be thrown</v>

10
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:59.951
<v Speaker 1>my way by the United States government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want it to instead be married by a law</v>

11
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:07.931
<v Speaker 1>of nature that is possible today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps for the first time because of</v>

12
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>advances in quantum physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think it.</v>

13
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Quantum physics tends to be either</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly theoretical or a system that is</v>

14
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:20.780
<v Speaker 1>used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

15
00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>in cryptography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

16
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>quantum entanglement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the essential systems that comes</v>

17
00:01:28.791 --> 00:01:33.791
<v Speaker 1>out of quantum mechanics is one that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential,</v>

18
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:38.831
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to serve as a way in which marriage can</v>

19
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>be based on a truly universal</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundation.</v>

20
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Quantum entanglement involves two or</v>
<v Speaker 1>more particles becoming effectively one</v>

21
00:01:53.031 --> 00:01:58.031
<v Speaker 1>and the same even if they are separated</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the universe from each other when</v>

22
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>they are entangled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that happens to one</v>

23
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>instantaneously happens to the other as</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it had been done to the second</v>

24
00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.183
<v Speaker 1>particle.</v>

25
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>That quality seems an awful lot like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what marriage is about,</v>

26
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.090
<v Speaker 1>this way in which you can lead separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and yet you still are somehow</v>

27
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:28.631
<v Speaker 1>bound and whatever comes away of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in a relationship also applies to</v>

28
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:35.291
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I set about building an apparatus</v>

29
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>that would allow my wife and I and</v>
<v Speaker 1>others as well to become entangled,</v>

30
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:46.820
<v Speaker 1>to become married in a way that no</v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental authority,</v>

31
00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>no religious authority could say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That it was not allowed,</v>

32
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>that it was inappropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gay marriage,</v>

33
00:02:54.861 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would not be an issue that a government</v>

34
00:02:58.671 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That any sort of relationship at all.</v>

35
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 1>If it was meaningful to you could become</v>
<v Speaker 1>fully manifest as an entangled</v>

36
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a marriage at the basis of all</v>

37
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The apparatus was very simple.</v>

38
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I used a special sort of crystal which</v>
<v Speaker 1>was able to take sunlight,</v>

39
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 1>photons and bombard two people standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>below the apparatus with those photons</v>

40
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>in a way that they themselves became</v>
<v Speaker 1>entangled by the entanglement of the</v>

41
00:03:38.681 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>photons so that while it would not</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily be all of them,</v>

42
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>while it would not necessarily withstand</v>
<v Speaker 1>all time and space,</v>

43
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>they could partake in this process of</v>
<v Speaker 1>entanglement and they could then take</v>

44
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>away from it what they wanted to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

45
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:05.070
<v Speaker 1>That is to say that any quantum system</v>
<v Speaker 1>is extremely delicate.</v>

46
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.140
<v Speaker 1>Entanglement is no exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any measurement that you make has the</v>

47
00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>effect of collapsing the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

48
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>two particles that are entangled if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>check to see if they are entangled,</v>

49
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>will become disentangled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so likewise to people who are</v>

50
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>married by the process of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>entanglement,</v>

51
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>should they questioned that bond and</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to interrogate it will become</v>

52
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>disentangled as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>

53
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the entanglement operates both literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>and metaphorically.</v>

54
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Literally because I'm using real</v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment that is used for entanglement</v>

55
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>for purposes of encryption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

56
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.770
<v Speaker 1>to entangle people and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming genuinely entangled by that</v>

57
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also,</v>

58
00:05:01.541 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>I think more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge that that process has</v>

59
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:09.961
<v Speaker 1>taken place and the way in which that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes those people behave.</v>

60
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 1>That is what makes for an entanglement</v>
<v Speaker 1>so special as a form of marriage.</v>

61
00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.290
<v Speaker 1>The fact that it really has to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>on faith ultimately because the quantum</v>

62
00:05:23.171 --> 00:05:28.171
<v Speaker 1>mechanics demands that and relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>are that way to relationships are</v>

63
00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>delicate in the sense that quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems are so.</v>

64
00:05:33.371 --> 00:05:38.371
<v Speaker 1>I think that we can actually learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>subatomic particles how to behave toward</v>

65
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>each other in a caring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm relationship.</v>

66
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:48.480
<v Speaker 1>I think that the metaphor that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherent in language and in the common</v>

67
00:05:49.781 --> 00:05:54.781
<v Speaker 1>understanding of a quantum process can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be something that we can apply quite</v>

68
00:05:55.841 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 1>literally and highly productively in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday lives.</v>

69
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>He might say that metaphors are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphors.</v>

70
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a poem.</v>

71
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.400
<v Speaker 1>How important can it be helped?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>

72
00:06:10.401 --> 00:06:15.401
<v Speaker 1>Can you take something that was meant</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the enjoyment that you might get</v>

73
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 1>reading a book?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To what extent can you really make use</v>

74
00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that metaphor actually is</v>

75
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.210
<v Speaker 1>something that can be used incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>productively by taking it literally not</v>

76
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 1>by taking it literally and leaving it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

77
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.320
<v Speaker 1>but recognizing the metaphor for what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is and finding what happens if you apply</v>

78
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:53.201
<v Speaker 1>it literally in your life so that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case of quantum physics,</v>

79
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.900
<v Speaker 1>because quantum physics is so weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>because quantum particles behave in ways</v>

80
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>that are so totally foreign to the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which we live,</v>

81
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>to our experience of the world.</v>

82
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Much of the discussion of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics happens metaphorically and the</v>

83
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:20.350
<v Speaker 1>metaphors can be mined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it can be applied.</v>

84
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe in ways that lead through</v>
<v Speaker 1>their literal application to different</v>

85
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 1>ways in which we can relate to each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other in the world.</v>

86
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:42.730
<v Speaker 1>That is to say that quantum particles</v>
<v Speaker 1>relate to each other in ways that are</v>

87
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:50.110
<v Speaker 1>entirely different from those with which</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are familiar from those with which we</v>

88
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.460
<v Speaker 1>relate with each other on an everyday</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

89
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>The way in which we relate to each other</v>
<v Speaker 1>on an everyday basis.</v>

90
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't always work so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We fight.</v>

91
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>We have problems communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go to war,</v>

92
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:13.790
<v Speaker 1>so might it be possible taking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum realm,</v>

93
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:19.840
<v Speaker 1>the metaphors that are used to explain</v>
<v Speaker 1>how quantum particles interact and</v>

94
00:08:20.511 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 1>applying those metaphors literally in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives that we made,</v>

95
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:30.280
<v Speaker 1>realign the way in which we live that</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes us somehow unlike how we were</v>

96
00:08:33.741 --> 00:08:38.741
<v Speaker 1>before and that repositioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it need not be absolute or</v>

97
00:08:39.471 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>permanent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least can be something that we can</v>

98
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:45.350
<v Speaker 1>try out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be another way in which we can</v>

99
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 1>consider our relationship with others</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can through that process,</v>

100
00:08:50.391 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>give us more perspective on the myriad</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

101
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:59.740
<v Speaker 1>As far as a society where there are 7</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion of us for how that society can</v>

102
00:09:01.011 --> 00:09:02.660
<v Speaker 1>interact and interrelate.</v>
