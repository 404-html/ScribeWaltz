00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about alcohol and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

2
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

4
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>the classic idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these artists,</v>

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>these great artists and great writers</v>
<v Speaker 1>drank a lot,</v>

7
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>therefore I better drink a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:29.461
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>I think that probably has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

11
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>that desire to embrace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

13
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>the ID souped up on alcohol is probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lead.</v>

14
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.120
<v Speaker 1>People astray more than it's helped</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

15
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:50.300
<v Speaker 1>I certainly am not going to tell people</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should,</v>

18
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>they should be teetotallers are never</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoked pot or never take drugs,</v>

19
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have taken drugs and smoke pot and</v>

21
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:00.060
<v Speaker 1>drunk too much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it made,</v>

23
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>has it helped my creativity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

24
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ups and downs and,</v>

28
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.353
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

29
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>but in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:24.591
<v Speaker 1>you need to be clearheaded enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do the work and the work of,</v>

31
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>of the creative work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me,</v>

32
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in the doing of it is not very</v>

33
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 1>enhanced by being drunk or being stoned.</v>
