1
00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.040
<v Speaker 1>Globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we are not taking advantage of</v>

2
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>our ability to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>multi nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multilateral alliances,</v>

4
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I think even on a smaller scale than</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations and we're not doing enough to</v>

5
00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>combat global warming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing enough to educate people</v>

6
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>who are incredibly talented in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

7
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:47.231
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing enough to deliver</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare to infants and children and</v>

8
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>women who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.000
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to be enterprising around the</v>

10
00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the,</v>

11
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>the issues that we're not addressing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's one underlying cause of are</v>

12
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>not addressing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

13
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>which is not taking advantage of how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can come together despite our</v>

14
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>differences and deliberate and decide to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do good.</v>

15
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>We need more institutions that bring us</v>
<v Speaker 1>together in civil but robust ways to do,</v>

16
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>to do good in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a great constitutional democracy</v>

17
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.260
<v Speaker 1>should be at the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies of the world.</v>

18
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Working multilaterally to bring more</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace and democracy and economic</v>

19
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:55.601
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing to the Group of Democracies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are ready,</v>

20
00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>agree that democracy is a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to those non democratic countries</v>

21
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.870
<v Speaker 1>where we can act multilaterally rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than unilaterally.</v>

22
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were at a depaul in Iraq right now,</v>

23
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the formula for digging us</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of it,</v>

24
00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>but when you're in a depo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't keep digging</v>

25
00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 1>individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should each use our talents to a lot</v>

26
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>with other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily people and ideally not</v>

27
00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:41.801
<v Speaker 1>people who are just like us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to ally with other people to do some</v>

28
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:46.850
<v Speaker 1>good in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means whether it we should be</v>

29
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 1>educating kids who otherwise wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get education.</v>

30
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.560
<v Speaker 1>We should be figuring out ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decreasing carbon emissions,</v>

31
00:02:57.021 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>if that's what we have the talent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity to do.</v>

32
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>We should be delivering healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Speaker 1>to people not as individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as collectivities and not depending</v>

34
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 1>too much on our government for doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a dependence citizenry is asking</v>

35
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>for trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to take initiatives all over and</v>

36
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I would say first and foremost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to begin locally.</v>

37
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.140
<v Speaker 1>That is the idea that we would know how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to save the world without doing some</v>

38
00:03:37.271 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>good in our own community is a form of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hubris and it's a form of Hubris that's</v>

39
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>brought a lot of damage to the world.</v>
