00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 1>They're begging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doc is called after the,</v>

2
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.373
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manassian bagans Israeli prime minister </v>

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.360
<v Speaker 1>order to strike the Iraqi reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommaso ciroc back in 1981.</v>

4
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the begging doc doctrine says that </v>

5
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:22.384
<v Speaker 1>Israel would never accept the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hostile country that calls for it's </v>

6
00:00:28.151 --> 00:00:28.984
<v Speaker 1>destructions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destructions holds the means to deliver </v>

7
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of operation,</v>

8
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:34.234
<v Speaker 1>meaning Israel would never tolerate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>existent of nuclear power in the hands </v>

9
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a hostile country like Syria or Iran.</v>

10
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>And you can draw your conclusions from </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>That if worst comes to worst as a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>last resort,</v>

12
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>if Israel is convinced that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>International Boyko doesn't work,</v>

13
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>that Russia and China do not align with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world,</v>

14
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:55.713
<v Speaker 1>that economic sanctions do not pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran enough that the United States is </v>

15
00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:00.184
<v Speaker 1>not going to take action and Iran is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting too close to close to enable </v>

16
00:01:04.091 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel with strike Iran.</v>

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you that long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not long ago,</v>

18
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>a few weeks ago in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>classify discussion dealing with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iranian issue,</v>

21
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:18.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a special form of the Israeli </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision and intelligence,</v>

22
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>operatives dealing with Iran.</v>

23
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>One of them said that if worse comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>

24
00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.583
<v Speaker 1>we must bear in mind what the Israeli </v>
<v Speaker 1>first Prime Minister David been going </v>

25
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:30.943
<v Speaker 1>and said repeatedly that we did not </v>
<v Speaker 1>bring the survivors of the Holocaust to </v>

26
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.460
<v Speaker 1>Israel to suffer another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another holocaust,</v>

27
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.790
<v Speaker 1>and we would do everything but </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything to prevent them.</v>
