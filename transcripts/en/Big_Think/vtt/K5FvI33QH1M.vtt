1
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I always felt forster was overrated</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>

2
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take an obvious example.</v>

3
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>Never really got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.100
<v Speaker 1>when people go on and on about Graham</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greene,</v>

5
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.840
<v Speaker 1>especially his important books like end</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the affair,</v>

6
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I get puzzled by.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't be.</v>

7
00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nothing wrong with green</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing wrong with forrester</v>

8
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like</v>

9
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>what's all the fuss about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is all the fuss about?</v>

10
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>Damned if I know frankly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

12
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>there must be American writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Dave Wallace I think is one of them</v>

13
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>and probably George Saunders is another</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I don't think the Brits get it all.</v>

14
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I think they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do people or why this is so.</v>

15
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>This is so purell oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy.</v>

16
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't know what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking or this is so bratty.</v>

17
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>It's so annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or it's so broad or whatever they're</v>

18
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a category of American</v>

19
00:01:20.911 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 1>fiction that just doesn't cross the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean so well.</v>

20
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think that I'm talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strain of British fiction writing</v>

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.630
<v Speaker 1>a not inconsiderable strain of British</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction writing that I don't that some</v>

22
00:01:36.631 --> 00:01:37.464
<v Speaker 1>people</v>

23
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what a novel is.</v>

24
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>It's an enforced or novel or a Graham</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greene novel.</v>

25
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:49.501
<v Speaker 1>They're living practitioners in England</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing novels that also today seem</v>

26
00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>this is what a real novelist is and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what a real novel is.</v>

28
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for some of us in America,</v>

29
00:01:58.091 --> 00:02:01.780
<v Speaker 1>you're just like say that's not even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelist hardly.</v>

30
00:02:01.781 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

31
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an a near perfect replica of a</v>

32
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

33
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's a taste thing.</v>

34
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a kind of well made</v>

35
00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>product that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that forster pioneered and represents,</v>

36
00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that engendered a great many very well</v>

37
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:32.911
<v Speaker 1>made novels in England in the 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century that either think is like what</v>

38
00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 1>an novel should be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or else you just throw up your hand.</v>
