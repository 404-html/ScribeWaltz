1
00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 2>there are two possible ways to extend</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life with action that you take</v>

3
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is to do things that allow you to</v>

4
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:21.591
<v Speaker 2>maintain your health for a longer period</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other is to act to hyphen that</v>

5
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.760
<v Speaker 2>referred so that the time when therapist</v>
<v Speaker 2>come along,</v>

6
00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 2>which can rejuvenate you and give you</v>
<v Speaker 2>another leaf of life,</v>

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 2>come along in time for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you are going downhill.</v>

8
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Those two things are additive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak.</v>

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.050
<v Speaker 2>They're independent criteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it turns out that the first</v>

10
00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 2>criteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's not much we can do unless of</v>

11
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:47.991
<v Speaker 2>course you are unusually for particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>age related problem like you know some</v>

12
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 2>people come down with type two diabetes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the 13th no drugs for that.</v>

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 2>If you are the sort of normally healthy</v>
<v Speaker 2>person who has natural lifespan is going</v>

14
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:02.061
<v Speaker 2>to be her more than there is nothing to</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak of that we can do that will extend</v>

15
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 2>your life by an appreciable amount or at</v>
<v Speaker 2>least that is proven to have jobs to be</v>

16
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:07.824
<v Speaker 2>able to do that.</v>

17
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 2>So we have to look at number two and</v>
<v Speaker 2>number two,</v>

18
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 2>the situation is completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter who you are,</v>

19
00:01:14.491 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 2>whether you're a scientist or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcast or a journalist or a general</v>

20
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 2>member of the public,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter who you are.</v>

21
00:01:21.061 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>You can make a difference by</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributing to the enthusiasm and</v>

22
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 2>society for this work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by changing the mood of the fatty and</v>

23
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 2>thereby changing the funding environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the work will be done more quickly.</v>

24
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally,</v>

25
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get enough sleep because I'm</v>

26
00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 2>traveling all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm on the road.</v>

27
00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:46.521
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to get this stuff to happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>and from a purely health point of view,</v>

28
00:01:46.651 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 2>that's probably bad to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably shortening my life,</v>

29
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure that I'm bringing</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward the day when the therapist will</v>

30
00:01:53.911 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 2>arrive by a larger amount that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>filling in in my life,</v>

31
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 2>but even in my own personal selfish</v>
<v Speaker 2>turned on probably winning.</v>

32
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>And of course I'm not only doing it for</v>
<v Speaker 2>selfish reasons.</v>

33
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing it to save your life as well.</v>
