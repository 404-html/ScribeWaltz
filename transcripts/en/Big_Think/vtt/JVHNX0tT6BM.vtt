00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Where does this come from and why does</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas Zions not have gas moves?</v>

2
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a great question.</v>

3
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I was alive when people to figure it out</v>
<v Speaker 2>or satisfied themselves as where our</v>

5
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 2>moon came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

6
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 2>it's generally agreed that our moon was</v>
<v Speaker 2>created when the earth was hit with</v>

7
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 2>another pretty big thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another asteroid.</v>

8
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the impact was very hard,</v>

9
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 2>very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the energy of the smashing was</v>

10
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:55.311
<v Speaker 2>converted to heat and both the earth and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon were hot and molten and they</v>

11
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 2>both cooled off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here we are with this other separate</v>

12
00:01:00.571 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 2>thing in orbit around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

13
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 2>why the gas giants not have gas moons is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great question.</v>

14
00:01:06.991 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is almost certainly</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of gravity.</v>

15
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 2>So when you have these little things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that spun off of,</v>

16
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 2>let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jupiter or Saturn,</v>

17
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 2>they were too small to sustain</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves as just balls of gas.</v>

18
00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 2>The gas shrunk down and gravity pulled</v>
<v Speaker 2>it down and formed a solid thing.</v>

19
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Speaker 2>Whereas in Jupiter and Saturn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so much,</v>

20
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.410
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spin,</v>

21
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>so much heat created that they're held,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 2>in the gaseous state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or what we would call gaseous state by</v>

23
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:51.171
<v Speaker 2>the energy that's coming out of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas the smaller ones cooled off so</v>

24
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 2>much that they turned solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a fantastic question.</v>

25
00:01:55.021 --> 00:02:00.021
<v Speaker 2>Aria and astrophysicists or planetary</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists speculate about this all the</v>

26
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what a fantastic thing that you made</v>

27
00:02:03.181 --> 00:02:06.150
<v Speaker 2>this observation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moons of Jupiter,</v>

28
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 2>the big ones I owes Calista,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

29
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europa and Ganymede,</v>

30
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>those big moons are cooled off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not,</v>

31
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 2>they're not gaseous like Jupiter that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whom they or what the orbit.</v>

32
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 2>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

33
00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And maybe more will be learned about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this and I gotta tell Ya,</v>

34
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 2>Aria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very reasonable that in your</v>

35
00:02:32.221 --> 00:02:37.221
<v Speaker 2>lifetime we will send the right</v>
<v Speaker 2>spacecraft to Europa and the moon of</v>

36
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.390
<v Speaker 2>Saturn and sell it us and Titan and look</v>
<v Speaker 2>for signs of life instead of being a gas</v>

37
00:02:45.841 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 2>giant.</v>

38
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 2>In this one example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europa is a moon of Jupiter that is,</v>

39
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has twice as much seawater as the earth</v>

40
00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.440
<v Speaker 2>and that water is under a layer of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I mentioned it because it's evidence</v>

41
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>of how things cool off when they're in</v>
<v Speaker 2>space and they're small or relatively</v>

42
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice forms.</v>

43
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 2>Because of the heat of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of creation,</v>

44
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>the thing smashed together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That heat is radiated into space.</v>

45
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 2>So there's a crust of ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the water underneath is kept liquid</v>

46
00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 2>by the gravitational exercising of its</v>
<v Speaker 2>orbit around Jupiter.</v>

47
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.990
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing what an Observation Aria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're making my day.</v>

48
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.560
<v Speaker 2>I hope you will be involved in missions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Europa and you will look for signs of</v>

49
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.120
<v Speaker 2>life below the ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

50
00:03:37.121 --> 00:03:39.310
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have an ocean for four and a half</v>

51
00:03:39.311 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 2>billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are going to happen.</v>

52
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It could be living things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There could be your opinions out there.</v>

53
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.550
<v Speaker 2>Fish people that you'll interact with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep us posted.</v>

54
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
