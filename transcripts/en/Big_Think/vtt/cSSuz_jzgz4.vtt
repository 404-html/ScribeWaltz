1
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's always useful journalistically to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember the kind of sine curve of a</v>

2
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>defeat in victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember I've just a couple of months</v>

3
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.393
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ran a cover,</v>

4
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had,</v>

5
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 1>four panels and Obama in three of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>is walking across water in radiant</v>

7
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great biblical figure.</v>

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>And in the fourth panel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he falls in the water.</v>

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.670
<v Speaker 1>This was at the nadir of the healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate.</v>

11
00:00:34.671 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 1>It looked like he was quite possibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to lose.</v>

12
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>There was already talk about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible November,</v>

13
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections were going to be for the</v>

14
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he turns it around and he won.</v>

15
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>He didn't win a bipartisan victory by</v>
<v Speaker 1>any means.</v>

16
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main politicking had to be within</v>

17
00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Party to put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it over.</v>

18
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>But all that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wanted an enormous victory and the</v>

19
00:00:57.351 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>momentum of the presidency changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long that'll last.</v>

20
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Will it have any bearing on what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>in November?</v>

21
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:06.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as those reports always say,</v>

22
00:01:06.201 --> 00:01:07.100
<v Speaker 1>we'll wait and see.</v>

23
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>Even though that Obama's political</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflex is political personality,</v>

24
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aims toward conciliation.</v>

25
00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly what made him a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal is early as Harvard law school.</v>

26
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>It's how he got to be the president of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law review by drawing in</v>

27
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>conservatives as well as liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is how he's succeeded.</v>

28
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>He's not a fool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sees reality.</v>

29
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>He sees the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the par partisan divisiveness in the</v>

30
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to win.</v>

31
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.830
<v Speaker 1>This is not some kind of pie eyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>idealist look at the healthcare bill.</v>

32
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That bill can tracked it and it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaped over time in ways he may not have</v>

33
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wanted to win.</v>

34
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>He did not want to walk out of there a</v>
<v Speaker 1>gallant loser.</v>

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conciliation is also not a strategy that</v>

36
00:01:57.481 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>will necessarily work with a pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>stubborn international forces.</v>

37
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:05.390
<v Speaker 1>Conciliation is not a necessarily a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or charm is not something that's going</v>

39
00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>to work with Mukmood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almadina,</v>

40
00:02:09.951 --> 00:02:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Jod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>or any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other political force of that.</v>

43
00:02:15.691 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>there's also a toughness to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not toughness that's obstreperous</v>

45
00:02:21.481 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a swaggering,</v>

46
00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>but he's capable of it.</v>
