1
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Preparing for an earthquake is</v>

2
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>multifaceted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multi dimensional.</v>

3
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.190
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing really is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware.</v>

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.420
<v Speaker 1>I've said that earthquakes and occur</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

6
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>but they're more likely some places than</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

7
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic awareness of where your house,</v>

8
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.620
<v Speaker 1>where you work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>where you are relative to the faults</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might cause an earthquake.</v>

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>That's a matter of public education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>but once you know what you're a risk</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be,</v>

12
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to bake some sort of personal</v>

13
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>judgment or if you're a government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of social judgment about the</v>

14
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 1>level of risk that you're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>accept it is going to be.</v>

15
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you're willing to accept or only</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to accept a low level of risk,</v>

16
00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>then there are a number of things you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do.</v>

17
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>You do to ensure that major</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure is resilient,</v>

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>that our water lines are power lines are</v>
<v Speaker 1>built in such a way so that they won't</v>

19
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>break that bridges and highways one fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

20
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>that fire stations will remain standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the fire personnel can respond</v>

21
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Speaker 1>and that hospitals remained standing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.040
<v Speaker 1>with respect to individuals in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes.</v>

23
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in an earthquake zone,</v>

24
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that your building is up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>code,</v>

25
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>if a code exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that you follow that code and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even little things like keeping the</v>

27
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>knickknacks away from the edge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelf,</v>

28
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker 1>keeping your dishes way back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the sorts of things that can</v>

29
00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:44.931
<v Speaker 1>make the difference between sort of a Ho</v>
<v Speaker 1>hum boy was at an interesting event to</v>

30
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>something that was a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>and these were all written down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to the fema websites,</v>

32
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>you sgs websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a whole list of these things.</v>

33
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>The problem arises when first you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have building codes,</v>

34
00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or those codes aren't enforced.</v>

35
00:02:00.511 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>That was a situation Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you don't have the national or</v>

36
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>social wealth to actually consider this</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you can do.</v>

37
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to bring up Haiti</v>

38
00:02:11.971 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the issue there was that there were</v>

39
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>so many sort of day to day problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>facing a Haiti culture in Haiti</v>

40
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:20.334
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

41
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>That's something that might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.730
<v Speaker 1>really can't get on the radar screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could argue the right or wrong</v>

43
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that basically is a situation and</v>

44
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.740
<v Speaker 1>sad to say that's tap us throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

45
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

46
00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>the basic things really quite easy to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've got the money to do them and</v>

47
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>if you've got the public awareness to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and if you've got the political</v>

48
00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>will to do them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're dealing with the Commons,</v>

49
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're dealing with infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>where you don't have the political will</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the wealth,</v>

51
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of things that the</v>

52
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:56.910
<v Speaker 1>community is trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of concentration on</v>

53
00:02:56.911 --> 00:03:01.911
<v Speaker 1>building small scale community awareness</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that the awareness of disaster,</v>

54
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>the awareness of potential disaster I</v>
<v Speaker 1>should say,</v>

55
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurs almost at the household level and</v>

56
00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>enabling people to make decisions but</v>
<v Speaker 1>also giving them sort of the simple</v>

57
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>things that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could do on a day to day</v>

58
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.404
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

59
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>Not just for earthquakes but for floods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for landslides.</v>

60
00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for that matter,</v>

61
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:24.910
<v Speaker 1>for longer term issues like sea level</v>
<v Speaker 1>rise and climate change.</v>

62
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the key things that we're doing</v>

64
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>at our institute and elsewhere is trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

65
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>to bring the knowledge we have about</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth processes.</v>

66
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>You're said dynamic planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun to look at.</v>

67
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>We enjoy doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it affects people.</v>

68
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things we're trying to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to bring that knowledge,</v>

69
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>not just throw it over the fence so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy makers can use it.</v>

70
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:52.001 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>there's none of a feedback and that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a system.</v>

72
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really,</v>

73
00:03:55.841 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>scientists need to understand social and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural constraints on using the</v>

74
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

75
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>even the utility of the information that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they provide.</v>

76
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.830
<v Speaker 1>And if I may say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the social scientists and</v>

77
00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>governments and ngos need to know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know,</v>

78
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's a difficult task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

79
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>but to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting and important thing</v>

80
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>to do and we're getting better at it.</v>
