1
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So a few years ago I went to go and</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate rumors of hippos,</v>

2
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>rogue hippos running riot it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rural Columbia.</v>

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippos don't naturally live in South</v>

4
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.620
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are from sub Saharan Africa and,</v>

5
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.190
<v Speaker 1>but these hippos had been transported to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia by Pablo Escobar.</v>

6
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>So Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many powerful men,</v>

7
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>fancied himself as a bit of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Noah's Ark,</v>

8
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>a kind of twisted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

9
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wanted to build his own menagerie</v>

10
00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>at a Hacienda Napoli's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was his ranch where he controlled</v>

11
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 1>his drug empire in between a Bogota</v>
<v Speaker 1>metagene in the,</v>

12
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Andes,</v>

13
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>in Colombia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And legend has it that he gathered</v>

14
00:00:55.741 --> 00:01:00.420
<v Speaker 1>together this menagerie by stealing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian cargo plane,</v>

15
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>flying it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or having it flown to Africa where he</v>

16
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>loaded it up with loads of illegal</v>
<v Speaker 1>wildlife and it had to get it back to</v>

17
00:01:08.161 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Columbia before the tranquilizer animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>woke up.</v>

18
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

19
00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>amongst this cargo of creatures was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>one male hippo that was nicknamed Lva,</v>

20
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>Ho and three females.</v>

21
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>And he transplanted these enormous piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a pond at his Hacienda.</v>

22
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And they loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that Columbia is a hippo</v>

23
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:41.421
<v Speaker 1>paradise because actually all hippos</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want is some nice shallow water</v>

24
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>to wallow around in and plenty of grass</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And Columbia has plenty of that and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>also has no other hippos,</v>

26
00:01:50.611 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>so no other competition and no natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>predators.</v>

27
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>So the hippos flourished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their new paradise.</v>

29
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And very quickly the four became eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became 12,</v>

30
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>became 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happens with hippos is you have</v>

31
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>a male who has a heart team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So every time one of Lva,</v>

32
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:18.681
<v Speaker 1>hose sons reach sexual maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would boot him out of the pond and</v>

33
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 1>that a young male hippo would then head</v>
<v Speaker 1>off in search of hippo love elsewhere.</v>

34
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course in Africa,</v>

35
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 1>this is completely normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hippos head off from there,</v>

36
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>their family group and young males will</v>
<v Speaker 1>go in search of hippo love,</v>

37
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

38
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>and start their own family.</v>

40
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>But of course in Columbia there are no</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippos out there.</v>

41
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>So these males,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these young males are being spirited</v>

42
00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>away from Hacienda Napoli's in one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the many,</v>

43
00:02:49.771 --> 00:02:54.000
<v Speaker 1>many rivers in that part of Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which acts like sort of hippo</v>

44
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>superhighway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're sort of pinging them out into</v>

45
00:02:57.331 --> 00:03:02.331
<v Speaker 1>the countryside and they arrive and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't find a mate.</v>

46
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they quite cantankerous piece the best</v>

47
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these are sorts of front frustrated,</v>

48
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>hoardy male hippos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desperately looking for love where there</v>

49
00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>is none.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

50
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Columbia to investigate this</v>

51
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:22.981
<v Speaker 1>story and visited one of these rogue</v>
<v Speaker 1>males that had installed himself in a</v>

52
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 1>pond next to a kindergarten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

53
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I've met the kids from the school who</v>
<v Speaker 1>told me that they no longer liked to</v>

54
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:37.681
<v Speaker 1>bathe in that particular pond to right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of them told me about how his</v>

55
00:03:38.591 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 1>grandmother had been chased by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>love lawn beast for quite some time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earlier in the week.</v>

57
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

58
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

59
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.250
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of running a mock</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

60
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>what do you do with this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got,</v>

62
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly multiplying hippos.</v>

63
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>And the extraordinary thing about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in Columbia is it's changing</v>

64
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.231
<v Speaker 1>their behavior because in Africa you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have this very fierce dry season,</v>

65
00:04:07.241 --> 00:04:08.090
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>puts the brakes on hippo reproduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think they,</v>

67
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>they reach sexual maturity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

68
00:04:15.461 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

69
00:04:16.451 --> 00:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

70
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>at five or seven years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

71
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.290
<v Speaker 1>But in Colombia they were reaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual maturity significantly earlier</v>

72
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.950
<v Speaker 1>and having babies every year instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>every two years.</v>

73
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>So they were multiplying at this much</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster rate because they didn't have the</v>

74
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>same constraints on them that they do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

75
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So you've got a bit of a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a massive invasive species</v>

76
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>now with most invasive species,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solution is to get rid of them</v>

77
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.300
<v Speaker 1>because basically they upset ecosystems</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

78
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.120
<v Speaker 1>and so they need to be removed.</v>

79
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.600
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with hippos though is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they store in Disney movies.</v>

80
00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:03.180
<v Speaker 1>So there is this sort of rogue male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:05:03.181 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>and the first one that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

82
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put down,</v>

83
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.860
<v Speaker 1>it was a public outcry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they had to come up with a</v>

84
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 1>different plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I met with the Colombian vet who was</v>

85
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>in charge of implementing the radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan B,</v>

86
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 1>which was the castration program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Carlos Valderrama was given the</v>

87
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.840
<v Speaker 1>onerous task of having to cast straight</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of these rogue males.</v>

88
00:05:35.081 --> 00:05:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Now this I'm sure you can appreciate as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a job that takes a fair amount of coneys</v>

89
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>because castrating a wild male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hippo is no easy task.</v>

90
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It is actually unbelievably complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

91
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm hippos because they've got so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

92
00:05:55.570 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>they're really hard to anesthetize</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the anesthetic dissolves in the</v>

93
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though they're enormous,</v>

94
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>you have to get the dosage right.</v>

95
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>They also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're nervous,</v>

96
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>they go into water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it to pass out in the</v>

97
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>water because it's going to drown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when you finally managed to a nice,</v>

98
00:06:12.621 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>it's Carlos sits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me had.</v>

99
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>And also they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

100
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:19.580
<v Speaker 1>really aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Carlos told me that he had</v>

101
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>decoys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cowboys and,</v>

102
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of shenanigans to try and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to get through the anesthetics</v>

103
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.220
<v Speaker 1>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the clock was on.</v>

104
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>They had a certain amount of time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to complete the,</v>

105
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the castration.</v>

106
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about hippos is they are the</v>

107
00:06:37.911 --> 00:06:40.550
<v Speaker 1>closest relative of the hippo is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whale.</v>

108
00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:46.660
<v Speaker 1>They have internal testicles that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>buried underneath about eight inches of</v>

109
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>skin and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

110
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.390
<v Speaker 1>but hippo testicles have a habit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering about when under threat they</v>

111
00:06:55.581 --> 00:07:00.581
<v Speaker 1>can move as much as eight centimeters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're looking at a blank canvas</v>

112
00:07:00.831 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 1>behind which there is a moving target.</v>

113
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get in there,</v>

114
00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.000
<v Speaker 1>they're the size of cantaloupes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just getting to them and working out</v>

115
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>where to make the incision and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>managing to grab hold of these moving</v>

116
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:16.991
<v Speaker 1>melons and getting them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>was quite some task and it's apparently</v>

117
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:22.900
<v Speaker 1>it took him about six hours and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cost</v>

118
00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.600
<v Speaker 1>well over $100,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

119
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they've managed to do one more.</v>

120
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I subsequently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're never going to.</v>

121
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too difficult.</v>

122
00:07:35.571 --> 00:07:39.200
<v Speaker 1>They're never going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>castrate all the males.</v>

123
00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 1>That's just not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think's going to happen is we're</v>

124
00:07:42.651 --> 00:07:45.590
<v Speaker 1>going to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new subspecies of Colombian hippo</v>

125
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>before too long hippopotamus Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris,</v>

126
00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how you make a new</v>

127
00:07:51.741 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>species you take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you put it in isolation from its parent</v>

128
00:07:55.011 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>species and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it evolves into a slightly</v>

129
00:07:58.041 --> 00:08:00.140
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different species.</v>

130
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's what's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hippo is always being quoted as</v>

131
00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:06.490
<v Speaker 1>being Africa's most dangerous animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I,</v>

132
00:08:06.491 --> 00:08:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I did some digging around and I've never</v>
<v Speaker 1>really been able to find out the source</v>

133
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:12.320
<v Speaker 1>of this fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you,</v>

134
00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>having been charged by a hippo myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are really,</v>

135
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dangerous.</v>

136
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:19.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

137
00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:22.220
<v Speaker 1>they do kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are extremely aggressive.</v>

138
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.560
<v Speaker 1>They move really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

139
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mail that we went to go and film the</v>

140
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.880
<v Speaker 1>rogue male in Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

141
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:31.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a little bit too close and he was</v>

142
00:08:31.521 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>in his pond and he came towards us with</v>
<v Speaker 1>such velocity that they were barrel</v>

143
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:37.880
<v Speaker 1>waves coming off his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.760
<v Speaker 1>coming off as nosy hurtled through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

145
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty terrifying.</v>

146
00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing about hippos is they are</v>

147
00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really dangerous.</v>

148
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dangerous to humans in Columbia</v>

149
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>who don't understand how dangerous they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are because culturally they haven't</v>

150
00:08:56.371 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>grown up alongside hippos.</v>

151
00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 1>I've seen them in Disney films.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're chubby and cute.</v>

152
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Carlos told me that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a real issue,</v>

153
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but also of course they all ecosystem</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers.</v>

154
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>One of the things about hippos is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

155
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're big animals,</v>

156
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>they churn up a lot of vegetation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the power to reshape their</v>

157
00:09:16.711 --> 00:09:21.660
<v Speaker 1>environment and it's this reshaping of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment that was.</v>

158
00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.740
<v Speaker 1>That was most alarming to cow call style</v>
<v Speaker 1>drama because he was worried that other</v>

159
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.080
<v Speaker 1>native species that share the rivers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like manatees for instance,</v>

160
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.260
<v Speaker 1>we would suffer with hippos being</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
