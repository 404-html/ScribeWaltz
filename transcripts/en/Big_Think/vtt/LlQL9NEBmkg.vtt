00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.540
<v Speaker 1>You can't develop a perfect system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody's gonna fall through the</v>

2
00:00:06.541 --> 00:00:08.130
<v Speaker 1>street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the cracks,</v>

3
00:00:08.131 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>but they fall through the cracks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe and Canada</v>

4
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>below it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying this,</v>

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I like our system of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to fight who mapped the human</v>

6
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>genome we did in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 1>who's the one that discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:30.770
<v Speaker 1>all the vast majority of new drugs in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last five years that are so helpful</v>

9
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>to curing illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans,</v>

10
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>American research labs and American</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

11
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the research companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to America because we do have a</v>

12
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:46.611
<v Speaker 1>cost structure that allow a company to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recoup their investment of their</v>

13
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>research when it costs to take a drug</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the laboratory to the bedside.</v>

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>And this is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

15
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you will find that kind of</v>

16
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>support and they in a European system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I think it's so important</v>

17
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>for us to keep our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own competitive system.</v>
