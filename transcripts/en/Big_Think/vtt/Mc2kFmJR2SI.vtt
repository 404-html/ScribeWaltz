00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Chooses amongst self replicating</v>
<v Speaker 1>entities.</v>

2
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Those self replicating entities have</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of power over that probability</v>

3
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>of being copied,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being replicated to being passed on.</v>

4
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>In practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that almost always means choosing</v>

5
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>between alternative DNA genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's about the natural selection,</v>

6
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>the disproportionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about the unequal survival of genes</v>

7
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>through generations that is not for</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection.</v>

8
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>We see it in the form of changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>phenotypes.</v>

9
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>That's to say changes in bodies because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's through the changes in the bodies</v>

10
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>that the genes induce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they ensure their survival or fail</v>

11
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that are good at surviving are</v>

12
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.520
<v Speaker 1>the ones that are good at building</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies that are good at surviving and</v>

13
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>reproducing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where gene machines in the sense that</v>

14
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:09.981
<v Speaker 1>her body is constructed by genes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been successful in surviving in the</v>

15
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good at surviving because</v>

16
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>they're good at constructing machines in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they survive.</v>

17
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.620
<v Speaker 1>So our body is a machine for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>propagation of the genes that built it.</v>
