00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear my seatbelt.</v>

2
00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is</v>

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>changed my personal habits in a way that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think are important.</v>

4
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has a</v>

5
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>more fundamentally given me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on life,</v>

6
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that each moment that we're given is an</v>

7
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>important one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you want to use those,</v>

8
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments,</v>

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

10
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>as ably as you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's with your family or your</v>

11
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>friends or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your working life,</v>

13
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>in all aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to,</v>

15
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.350
<v Speaker 1>to seize the moment because those can</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to an end at any point in time.</v>

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>life is a,</v>

17
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>is a real luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>that one shouldn't take for granted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So philosophically,</v>

19
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>I think I've grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>by the experience and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>I guess the last thing I know is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always knew that you had to do things</v>

24
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>or things where we're not always of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own creation.</v>

25
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm alive because a lot of good people</v>
<v Speaker 1>help me get a chance to be alive in a</v>

26
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>certain city in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the circumstances that evolved.</v>

27
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And if they hadn't been there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>I could have been the smartest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have been the richest guy.</v>

29
00:01:45.691 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>I could have been anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still wouldn't be alive.</v>

30
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because a lot of other people make</v>

31
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:56.511
<v Speaker 1>things happen that I think all of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a chance to be a happy,</v>

32
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.480
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.483
<v Speaker 1>be who,</v>
