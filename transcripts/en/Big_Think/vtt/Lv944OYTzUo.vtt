1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>in terms of associates who've been</v>
<v Speaker 2>differed from their law firm jobs,</v>

3
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

4
00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:16.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess I would say a couple of things.</v>

5
00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 2>First be patient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will start eventually,</v>

6
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 2>hopefully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 2>there had been a couple of cases of law</v>
<v Speaker 2>firms that,</v>

8
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 2>that told associates who thought they</v>
<v Speaker 2>had jobs will actually you no longer</v>

9
00:00:27.141 --> 00:00:30.650
<v Speaker 2>have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most firms seem to be honoring that</v>

10
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 2>commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:36.380
<v Speaker 2>the second thing I would say is a focus</v>
<v Speaker 2>on developing your professional skills.</v>

12
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>So if you are working in a public</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest organization for that time,</v>

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>really take the ball and run with it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see what kind of responsibilities you</v>

14
00:00:43.521 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 2>can get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be able to get more</v>

15
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>responsibilities during the public</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest year that you are awaiting out</v>

16
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 2>waiting to start for the law firm than</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will as a junior associate at a law</v>

17
00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>firm.</v>

18
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.410
<v Speaker 2>So the second thing I would say is</v>
<v Speaker 2>really try to make the most of your</v>

19
00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:00.050
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the third thing I would say is enjoy</v>

20
00:01:00.051 --> 00:01:02.810
<v Speaker 2>your time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You will have a lifetime to work and if</v>

21
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 2>you want to work at a firm and a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could work for decades,</v>

22
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make partner or if you moved to</v>

23
00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 2>another firm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't make partner,</v>

24
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you could work at a law firm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one thing that's nice about lawyers</v>

25
00:01:14.061 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 2>is it is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a mental discipline.</v>

26
00:01:17.841 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Granted there are physical demands as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

27
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:23.730
<v Speaker 2>but it's not like were baseball players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can work into our sixties,</v>

28
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>into our seventies so you will have your</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life to work and if you are</v>

29
00:01:27.441 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 2>deferred right now and you are either at</v>
<v Speaker 2>your leisure or if you're working at a</v>

30
00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 2>job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say at a public interest organization</v>

31
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 2>with reasonable hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy it.</v>

32
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.330
<v Speaker 2>Have dinner with your wife or husband or</v>
<v Speaker 2>boyfriend or girlfriend.</v>

33
00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Go on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do the things that you might not be able</v>

34
00:01:41.091 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 2>to do once the economy turns around and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're at a firm and you're billing</v>

35
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>2,500 hours a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I guess that will be my advice.</v>

36
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 2>We actually have a series on the blog</v>
<v Speaker 2>called career alternative is where we</v>

37
00:01:56.761 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 2>focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>interesting things that people who have</v>
<v Speaker 2>law degrees are doing that don't involve</v>

39
00:02:03.391 --> 00:02:05.520
<v Speaker 2>working at a law firm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

40
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that's nice about one silver</v>

41
00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 2>lining,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess to the recession generally as</v>

42
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 2>people are coming up with business</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

43
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 2>partly because perhaps they lost their</v>
<v Speaker 2>lucrative,</v>

44
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 2>stable job at a big company and now they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to come up with something else.</v>

45
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we've talked,</v>

46
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 2>we've talked to lawyers who have started</v>
<v Speaker 2>tutoring and uh,</v>

47
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 2>admissions consulting businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lawyer who has started a cupcake</v>

48
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:30.420
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he drives around Manhattan in a truck</v>

49
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 2>selling cupcakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have talked to lawyers who have done</v>

50
00:02:34.081 --> 00:02:36.960
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lawyer who owns a chain of</v>

51
00:02:36.961 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 2>subway sandwich stores and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

52
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 2>even though they're not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>using their legal training,</v>

53
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.280
<v Speaker 2>we'll talk about how valuable it is to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that kind of education,</v>

54
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.860
<v Speaker 2>the critical thinking skills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the communication,</v>

55
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 2>the ability to look over a contract when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are trying to launch their</v>

56
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 2>businesses.</v>

57
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 2>These are all things that help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So granted,</v>

58
00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>a law degree is expensive and so if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're thinking about going to law</v>

59
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:02.290
<v Speaker 2>school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would urge you to think very carefully</v>

60
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once you have that degree,</v>

61
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>it is quite versatile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've looked at lawyers who've gone into</v>

62
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 2>public relations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who've gone into journalism,</v>

63
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 2>who've gone into finance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a lot of things you can do</v>

64
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 2>with a law degree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a great credential to have.</v>

65
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a great education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is just a question of bang for</v>

66
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>your buck because there are a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that are good to have,</v>

67
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>but do you want to spend $200,000 for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>
