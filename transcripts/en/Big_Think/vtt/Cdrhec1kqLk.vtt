1
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I think firstly we tried to make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction between national culture and</v>

2
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>company culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>when we go to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to India,</v>

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>to Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Brazil,</v>

5
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>to Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Germany,</v>

6
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>to Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they,</v>

7
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.900
<v Speaker 1>each country has different country</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and that's great.</v>

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why we travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why during vacations we tried to</v>

9
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>go to different places to experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>those difference,</v>

10
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>different cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is great.</v>

11
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we say is that she wanted to join</v>

12
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that we are one</v>

13
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one culture.</v>

14
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.280
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much about common sense.</v>

15
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>It's so much about what a good athlete</v>
<v Speaker 1>would do to perform.</v>

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>It's so much what a good student would</v>
<v Speaker 1>do to perform.</v>

17
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's a performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high performance culture that we're</v>

18
00:00:57.361 --> 00:01:00.570
<v Speaker 1>trying to build here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've met people,</v>

19
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.711
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

20
00:01:01.711 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last 10 years we've,</v>

21
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>we've been through five or six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>business combinations.</v>

23
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>And during all those business</v>
<v Speaker 1>combinations,</v>

24
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I often ask the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is different between our company</v>

25
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>and this company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're merging with,</v>

26
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not right or wrong,</v>

27
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>but what's different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only thing I could put my</v>

28
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>fingers on was what we call the dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>people culture.</v>

29
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have people that aspire to build</v>

30
00:01:26.821 --> 00:01:31.821
<v Speaker 1>something that is out of the ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something that's in class that</v>

31
00:01:32.311 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>you can be both part of and proud off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's already a very good</v>

32
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If because of that,</v>

33
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>you understand that as a company it can</v>
<v Speaker 1>only be as good as the quality of people</v>

34
00:01:42.871 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>in talent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to attract,</v>

35
00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>retain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deploy,</v>

36
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:48.990
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you have the people component,</v>

37
00:01:48.991 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>which is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only be as good as the kind of</v>

38
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>people and talent you attract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then if you have this ownership</v>

39
00:01:55.261 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>culture that says that this is our</v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

40
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>so therefore we should make decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>and treated as our own business,</v>

41
00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>then you are in a much better place.</v>

42
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the best kept secret in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our company is a dream people culture.</v>

43
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.510
<v Speaker 1>Because when you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so consents.</v>

44
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>It's so obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most companies would think it goes</v>

45
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>without saying and they would take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted.</v>

46
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Here at Anheuser Busch Inbev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about it every day because we</v>

47
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:36.501
<v Speaker 1>think that's really what we stand for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so much of what we are as a</v>

48
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.250
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a group,</v>

49
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>therefore it's worth talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

51
00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't buy into the dream,</v>

52
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>if you don't mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the dream that we're trying to build</v>

53
00:02:50.161 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>something out of the ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's best in class,</v>

54
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>best of your company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the better world.</v>

55
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.770
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the targets that we put to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>business on a yearly basis basis don't</v>

56
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>make sense because they are very tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>

57
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>The kids feeling to try it to be best in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do good is not good enough.</v>

58
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't buy it to that dream in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first place,</v>

59
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a problem accepting</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough targets,</v>

60
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>stretch targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy into the concept that we're</v>

61
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>trying to build something that's best in</v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

62
00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>then of course we need to have stretch</v>
<v Speaker 1>targets because that's what we need.</v>

63
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need the best people,</v>

64
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>not just good or average people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course we need to own this business</v>

65
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>because we're proud of it and we're part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

66
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>So this whole thing kind of connects all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dots.</v>

67
00:03:33.521 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we talk about dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>people culture all the time because</v>

68
00:03:36.851 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our experience,</v>

69
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>merging with other companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the only thing that</v>

70
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>differentiated performance wise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our company from other companies.</v>
