00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>The one that jumps out at me as frown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frown,</v>

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 1>checking Valerie Piper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany in the 70s.</v>

3
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>He play in the NASL for the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he played for the cosmos.</v>

4
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:16.561
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.850
<v Speaker 1>I should know my history better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.713
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>he's just an amazing player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very graceful.</v>

8
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his decision making was always,</v>

9
00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clever and,</v>

10
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>and the way he led was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

12
00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say say behind the scenes,</v>

13
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>but just in terms of on the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's always projected a cool and</v>

14
00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:37.050
<v Speaker 1>calmness and this composure that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought permeated through the rest of</v>

15
00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>the team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's,</v>

16
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that I try to emulate in some</v>

17
00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things are getting tough and things</v>

19
00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>are hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I may try to just try to find that</v>

20
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>balance of trying to bring it back the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other way.</v>

21
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if guys I don't think are doing</v>

22
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>

23
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>I can be that guy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's been the hardest</v>

24
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>thing for me because that goes against</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grain is being this other guy.</v>

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have in me,</v>

26
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>but I never really bring out that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I just,</v>

27
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>that's not really the guy I choose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

28
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
