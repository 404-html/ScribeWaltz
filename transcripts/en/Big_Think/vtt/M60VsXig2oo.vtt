<v Speaker 1>Dennis kucinich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in Cleveland,</v>

2
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Ohio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oldest of seven children,</v>

3
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.000
<v Speaker 1>and my parents never owned a home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>we were renters by the time I was 17.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We lived in 21 different places,</v>

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>including a couple of cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>that experience of growing up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inner city,</v>

7
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>which I've outlined in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a book that I've just released called</v>

8
00:00:30.181 --> 00:00:35.181
<v Speaker 1>the courage to survive is an experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really had an indelible imprint</v>

9
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>upon the way I look at the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon my soul because it,</v>

10
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it taught me compassion,</v>

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.040
<v Speaker 1>what people go through to just try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it day to day,</v>

12
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>the importance of a job of a healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to put food on the table and</v>

13
00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 1>clothes on kids' backs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The important of education,</v>

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.520
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>these are all things that are part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's practical aspirations and</v>

16
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:07.290
<v Speaker 1>having been riveted and that experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up in Cleveland,</v>

17
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I understand as someone aspiring to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States,</v>

18
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>how terribly important all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are for,</v>

19
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.020
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people.</v>

20
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

21
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.570
<v Speaker 1>my worldview is truly shaped by that</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and growing up.</v>

22
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And I know the whole world didn't live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conditions that were near poverty and</v>

23
00:01:32.821 --> 00:01:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also know that those who do don't</v>

24
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>have many spokes persons in government.</v>
