1
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Every form of spirituality we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify whether it's traditional</v>

2
00:00:07.621 --> 00:00:11.250
<v Speaker 1>religious forms of spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a kind of a materialistic,</v>

3
00:00:11.251 --> 00:00:16.251
<v Speaker 1>scientific worldview or progressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality in all its many phases as</v>

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>in the last 50 years that have emerged</v>
<v Speaker 1>within American culture and elsewhere</v>

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>have both dignities and disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>The spirituality brings out the best and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst in humanity.</v>

7
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>And so every one of these major</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories,</v>

8
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious,</v>

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>the secular and the progressive have</v>
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful and important</v>

10
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.920
<v Speaker 1>expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also have dark expressions,</v>

11
00:00:40.921 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>which we do well to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I certainly feel that scientology is</v>

12
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 1>a dark expression of progressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality or maybe even secular</v>

13
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really clear how to categorize</v>

14
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a cult and we see cults of all</v>

16
00:00:56.251 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you're dealing with something</v>

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>that's ultimately true and real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's people can go astray.</v>

18
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>They can be pulled into forms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization,</v>

19
00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabolical.</v>

21
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I had in the signs of a cult include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>particularly strong personality who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants everyone else to conform.</v>

24
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

25
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>it can include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

26
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>intense commercialization in which it</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems more like a business than a form</v>

27
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>of spirituality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that the best way we can protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves on the spiritual journey is by</v>

29
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>taking an integral view of spirituality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is seeing how spirituality evolves and</v>

30
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>seeing how it can become stuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how it regresses.</v>

31
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>And so if we look at scientology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see that there's a lot of</v>

32
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>negative fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of lives have been ruined,</v>

33
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>a lot of false hoods had been projected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so using this test of their fruits,</v>

34
00:01:53.341 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>we'd be able to determine right away</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's the kind of spirituality we</v>

35
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>would do well to avoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

36
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>I think spirituality is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a personal affair.</v>

37
00:02:02.521 --> 00:02:05.640
<v Speaker 1>And while we can socialize our</v>
<v Speaker 1>spirituality and be part of a spiritual</v>

38
00:02:05.641 --> 00:02:08.610
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirituality in its essence is</v>

39
00:02:08.611 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>really about our own spiritual growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our own experience of that,</v>

40
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>which is beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true and good.</v>

41
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining our,</v>

43
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 1>our prerogative as agents of evolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as indeed agents of our own</v>

44
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:28.980
<v Speaker 1>spiritual growth is one way we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect ourselves from,</v>

45
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ways that we can be led astray in</v>

46
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>the spiritual marketplace of ideas.</v>
