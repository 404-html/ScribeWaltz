00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.800
<v Speaker 1>BMI stands for business model</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

2
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Innovation is often thought to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something new,</v>

3
00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>but mostly doing something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By developing a new technology,</v>

4
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>finding a new market or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or designing a product to better match</v>

5
00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:16.930
<v Speaker 1>consumer needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business model innovation is a different</v>

6
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where you produce basically the</v>

7
00:00:19.961 --> 00:00:22.660
<v Speaker 1>same product address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same market needs.</v>

8
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>But the way in which you provision this</v>
<v Speaker 1>product to the market involves a new</v>

9
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>business model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could be a new revenue model,</v>

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>this could be a new cost model or most</v>
<v Speaker 1>interestingly it could be in different</v>

11
00:00:34.211 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>risk model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these models might help you</v>

12
00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>disrupt incumbents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the way things are done in an,</v>

13
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>in an industry and provide a superior</v>
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>

14
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:46.900
<v Speaker 1>superior services and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and disrupt the game in the industry.</v>

15
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>So first off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

16
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>BMI as an approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>is not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only about mitigating risk,</v>

19
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>it is more about managing risk.</v>

20
00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>So we often think risk is a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got to a risk is going to hurt our</v>

21
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:02.001
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Risk is,</v>

22
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is always a bad thing.</v>

23
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>Turns out companies that can better</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage risk companies that can</v>

24
00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:12.070
<v Speaker 1>differentiate themselves from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>incumbents in how their business model</v>

25
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.790
<v Speaker 1>deals with the risk might have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant advantage over the</v>

26
00:01:15.791 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 1>incumbents over the folks who don't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

27
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 1>So we can think of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the transportation industry,</v>

29
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>a company like Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this transportation network</v>

30
00:01:26.411 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 1>provider company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taxi hailing app,</v>

31
00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:31.120
<v Speaker 1>some [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you might know a,</v>

32
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.200
<v Speaker 1>compare that to a traditional taxi</v>
<v Speaker 1>service provider or a black car,</v>

33
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 1>a service provider.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Black car service provider has,</v>

34
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>has a much more risk in its business</v>
<v Speaker 1>model because it has to invest in,</v>

35
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a heavy asset load before any,</v>

36
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>any demand shows up come through.</v>

37
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>Like Uber on the other hand has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business model which has a lot,</v>

38
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:55.900
<v Speaker 1>lot lower risks because it's the cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>and revenue scale up together.</v>

39
00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>If a lot of people want born taxi rides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uber ends up,</v>

40
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing in a lot of drivers on board.</v>

41
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>If nobody wants a taxi ride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no traffic drivers who are</v>

42
00:02:06.221 --> 00:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that that business model manages the</v>

43
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>demand risk in a lot superior fashion</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a traditional taxi model does.</v>

44
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>And that allows it to differentiate</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself from the traditional model and,</v>

45
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:20.200
<v Speaker 1>and provide a superior service to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers,</v>

46
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>basically a service which allows them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost guarantee,</v>

47
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car within a few minutes,</v>

48
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>irrespective of where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they are or irrespective of the</v>

49
00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.600
<v Speaker 1>time of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

50
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>that's using risk to differentiate</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself not only as something you have</v>

51
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>we have to worry about or tried to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mitigate.</v>

52
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
