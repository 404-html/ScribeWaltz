00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Restaurants are overrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem,</v>

2
00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like every restaurant that's,</v>

3
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.910
<v Speaker 2>that's gotten great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a recommendation tends to combat it</v>

6
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a lot of exaggeration that I don't</v>

7
00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 2>know if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that my fault is that,</v>

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the public,</v>

9
00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:27.790
<v Speaker 2>is that the eating public's fault or is</v>
<v Speaker 2>it the media's fault?</v>

10
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

11
00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.940
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something going on there where the</v>

12
00:00:30.941 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 2>expectation level is just too high and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always going to disappoint,</v>

13
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 2>which is why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're here nine times out of 10,</v>

14
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:40.720
<v Speaker 2>you here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just like going to like the informal</v>

15
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.381
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.161
<v Speaker 2>down the street,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:00:42.161 --> 00:00:45.010
<v Speaker 2>the place that a Mexican burrito and</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

18
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 2>of course you do because your</v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation level is nothing and it's</v>

19
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 2>tasty food and it meets the expectation</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's cheap.</v>

20
00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.440
<v Speaker 2>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's fun and informal and like,</v>

21
00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:55.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it informs you and,</v>

22
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sustains you in a way that,</v>

23
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big fancy restaurant can't.</v>

24
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find myself being disappointed going</v>

25
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 2>out so often,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

26
00:01:02.741 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's me just expecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot and then falling short or if it's</v>

27
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 2>being played up before</v>

28
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I get there.</v>
