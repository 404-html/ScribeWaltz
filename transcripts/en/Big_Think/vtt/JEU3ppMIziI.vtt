1
00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Nobody doesn't love you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me back up.</v>

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>When we think of places you might find</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.640
<v Speaker 1>we typically think of the goldilocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone around a star where water would be</v>

4
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>liquid in its natural state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you get a little too close to the</v>

5
00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat would evaporate the water and you</v>

6
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>don't have it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

7
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Too far away would freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And neither of those states of h two o</v>

8
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.620
<v Speaker 1>or are useful to life as we know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need liquid water.</v>

9
00:00:39.621 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>So you can establish this green zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this habitable zone,</v>

10
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>this goldilocks zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where if you find a planet orbiting</v>

11
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

12
00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a good chance it could have liquid</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

13
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's look there first for life as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it.</v>

14
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out that the source of heat</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

15
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>is traceable to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you go farther out,</v>

16
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>everything would or should be frozen.</v>

17
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.850
<v Speaker 1>All other things being equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you're Ropa a moon of Jupiter</v>

18
00:01:07.851 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>sitting well outside of the goldilocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>zone is kept warm,</v>

19
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>not from energy sources traceable to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun,</v>

20
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>but from what we call the tidal forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Jupiter itself.</v>

21
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:25.601
<v Speaker 1>So Jupiter and surrounding moons are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually pumping energy into Europa.</v>

22
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>And how did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you rope it orbits Jupiter,</v>

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>it's shape changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fundamentally different from</v>

24
00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:40.961
<v Speaker 1>tides rising and falling on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The shape of the water system of the</v>

25
00:01:43.191 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>earth is responding to tidal forces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mood.</v>

26
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.010
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that to a solid object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solid object is,</v>

27
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>is stressing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because of this,</v>

28
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of this is that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumping energy into the object.</v>

29
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>It is no different from when you say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone who's familiar with racket</v>

30
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indoor racket,</v>

31
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could be a racket ball or squash.</v>

32
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's warm up the ball before we start</v>

33
00:02:12.351 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 1>playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to hit it around a few times.</v>

34
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>You are literally warming up the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just simply let's get loose.</v>

35
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.080
<v Speaker 1>You are literally warming up the ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you are distorting it every time you</v>

36
00:02:24.081 --> 00:02:28.370
<v Speaker 1>smack it and then the resilience of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ball pops it back into shape.</v>

37
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And every time you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every smack your pumping energy into the</v>

38
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:38.501
<v Speaker 1>ball is not fundamentally different from</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in orbit around Jupiter.</v>

39
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>So you have this frozen world Europa</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely frozen on its surface,</v>

40
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.160
<v Speaker 1>but you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the surface and there cracks</v>

41
00:02:49.161 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>in the ice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

42
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>ridges in the ice where there's a crack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's shifted.</v>

43
00:02:55.641 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>And then refroze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this Ridge has discontinuity in the</v>

44
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:02.980
<v Speaker 1>crack and then continues in another</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

45
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.120
<v Speaker 1>So what this tells you is that Europa</v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot be completely frozen because if</v>

46
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing would be moving.</v>

47
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>You look at the surface of Europa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frozen surface,</v>

48
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.330
<v Speaker 1>they're like ice chunks that are like</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted and refrozen and shifted again.</v>

49
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 1>It looks just like if you fly over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>the Arctic ocean fly over the Arctic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ocean in the winter.</v>

52
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>These are ice sheets that are breaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>and refreezing all the time.</v>

53
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.420
<v Speaker 1>It's the same signature as that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of us are convinced that beneath</v>

54
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 1>this icy surface is an ocean of liquid</v>
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>

55
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>And there's no reason to think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have been liquid for billions</v>

56
00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>of years on earth where we find liquid</v>
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>

57
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>we find life.</v>

58
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

59
00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Wherever we find liquid water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find life even places like the Dead</v>

60
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.470
<v Speaker 1>Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did anybody call it a Dead Sea?</v>

61
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Because the microscope hadn't yet been</v>
<v Speaker 1>invented.</v>

62
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And sure of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's no macroscopic vertebrate</v>

63
00:04:11.761 --> 00:04:16.110
<v Speaker 1>fishes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but microbes</v>

64
00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.730
<v Speaker 1>have no problems thriving in practically</v>
<v Speaker 1>any conditions under which you would</v>

65
00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>find liquid water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what this means is not only do we</v>

66
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>have a source of heat outside of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goldilocks zone,</v>

67
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.780
<v Speaker 1>we have conditions under which life</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be thriving.</v>

68
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>And knowing that this is possible has</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely broaden the net that we are</v>

69
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:43.130
<v Speaker 1>casting in search for life in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

70
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>No longer is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

71
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.280
<v Speaker 1>let's find a 72 degree title pond and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see life forming there.</v>

72
00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:56.891
<v Speaker 1>No life is pretty hardy and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it takes liquid water,</v>

73
00:04:57.231 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be the other place in the solar</v>

74
00:05:00.621 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 1>system that is teaming with some form or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another of life.</v>

75
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.750
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all want to go to your roper period.</v>

76
00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>Can we got to go ice fishing though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you've got to cut a hole or melt a</v>

77
00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:15.380
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get there somehow because</v>

78
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:20.381
<v Speaker 1>this sheet of ice by some estimates are</v>
<v Speaker 1>several kilometers thick.</v>

79
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.540
<v Speaker 1>And so it'll take some effort to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>through that,</v>

80
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.940
<v Speaker 1>which we haven't really fully figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out yet.</v>

81
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.520
<v Speaker 1>But it's an engineering problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a science problem.</v>

82
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.180
<v Speaker 1>So clever engineers should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure that one out.</v>

83
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you rope is not the only one of these</v>

84
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 1>moons in the outer solar system that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept warm by the sort of title stress</v>

85
00:05:40.941 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other moons that feel the same</v>

86
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.790
<v Speaker 1>influx of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

87
00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 1>io,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the innermost moon of Jupiter</v>

88
00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>that suffers from this phenomenon even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more at that moon is so hot.</v>

89
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 1>There are volcanoes erupting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>within.</v>

90
00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 1>There it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is rendered Multan whatever solid</v>

91
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>parts of that moon there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so in fact,</v>

92
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.850
<v Speaker 1>the most volcanically active place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the solar system is io,</v>

93
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.320
<v Speaker 1>one of the moons of Jupiter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't know how to sustain life</v>

94
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>under temperatures that hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

95
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's a reminder that if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for sources of energy,</v>

96
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.510
<v Speaker 1>we no longer need to be anchored to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>host star in our search for life in the</v>

97
00:06:36.771 --> 00:06:37.604
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>

98
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.540
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
