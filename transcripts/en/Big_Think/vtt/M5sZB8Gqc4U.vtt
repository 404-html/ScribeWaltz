1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.410
<v Speaker 2>there are many big challenges today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

3
00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:17.411
<v Speaker 2>there are the mass atrocities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Places liked r four or I'm eastern</v>

4
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.970
<v Speaker 2>Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where where many,</v>

5
00:00:19.971 --> 00:00:24.500
<v Speaker 2>many people are killed and displaced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are highly repressive governments,</v>

6
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:29.501
<v Speaker 2>say North Korea or Burma or Uzbekistan</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Turkmenistan where just the severity</v>

7
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>of the government repression deserves</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.460
<v Speaker 2>There are places where wars have become</v>
<v Speaker 2>so chaotic that,</v>

9
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 2>that the lack of government is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

10
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 2>I think Iraq as an example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in that sense,</v>

11
00:00:45.681 --> 00:00:50.390
<v Speaker 2>there are many situations where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where violence and repression call out</v>

12
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 2>for urgent attention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are other,</v>

13
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quieter forms of abuse that we tend not</v>

14
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you tend not to see in the headlines,</v>

15
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 2>but that nonetheless affect many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people quite severely.</v>

16
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 2>And here I think about say that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>severe restrictions on,</v>

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 2>on the rights of women that exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many parts of the world.</v>

18
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about migrant workers who were</v>

19
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:15.281
<v Speaker 2>forced to travel long distances and in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign environment often are exist</v>

20
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.890
<v Speaker 2>completely without respect for rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wholly at the whim of their</v>

21
00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 2>employer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about,</v>

22
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>children who may be drafted to be</v>

23
00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 2>soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll Mariano physically seized and</v>

24
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 2>course to become soldiers or who have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>serve as as domestics in lieu of going</v>

25
00:01:30.351 --> 00:01:32.480
<v Speaker 2>to school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are many of these quieter</v>

26
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:34.220
<v Speaker 2>issues that don't get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>headlines,</v>

27
00:01:34.221 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 2>but that are also quite acute problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
