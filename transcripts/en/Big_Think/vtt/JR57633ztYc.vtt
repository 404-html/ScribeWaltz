00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.730
<v Speaker 1>The mind is a brain that's conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness is a synonym for</v>

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:07.150
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a conceptual gap between</v>

3
00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.990
<v Speaker 1>subjectivity and objective observation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what science is.</v>

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I would actually maintain that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no scientific way to demonstrate that an</v>

5
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:19.420
<v Speaker 1>entity is conscious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only a parent to itself,</v>

6
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.920
<v Speaker 1>and my prediction is that we will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an objective prediction.</v>

7
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>We will come to accept entities that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not biological,</v>

8
00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as conscious,</v>

9
00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.960
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to be okay machines</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the right side of the room.</v>

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Humans on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talked to your biological human,</v>

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>that they will have lots of non</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological processes going on in their</v>

12
00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>body and brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those computers will be out in the</v>

13
00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 1>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thinking of that person isn't</v>

14
00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>even just in their body and brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in the non biological portion,</v>

15
00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it's out on the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be all mixed up.</v>

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be a clear distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between human and machine.</v>

17
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>The bottom line is we are one human</v>
<v Speaker 1>machine civilization.</v>

18
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>This technology is already expanded who</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>

19
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:07.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to go into high gear when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get to the steep part of the</v>

20
00:01:07.631 --> 00:01:08.410
<v Speaker 1>exponential.</v>
