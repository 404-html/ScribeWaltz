00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Let's take the video of Philando</v>
<v Speaker 1>castile's death.</v>

2
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.010
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>shot by his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.810
<v Speaker 1>his fiance and her readiness with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone.</v>

5
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:22.310
<v Speaker 1>And her quick instinct to use facebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>live is very,</v>

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>was very potent in that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People may remember that,</v>

7
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is watching her fiance bleed to</v>

8
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:36.611
<v Speaker 1>death and at the same time calling out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to two entities to witness her.</v>

9
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>The first is God and the second is</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

10
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 1>So she wants our witness the purpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we as users,</v>

11
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>as responsible users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as humane users of the Internet have.</v>

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Our responsibility is to bear witness in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

13
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to experience it ourselves so much</v>

14
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.270
<v Speaker 1>as to testify to the fact of the fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it happened to serve as a massive</v>

15
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>jury of peers who would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who give credence to the experience of</v>

16
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:09.740
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in that way,</v>

17
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extremely profound moment in the way,</v>

18
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>crystallizing the way that we all use</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook when we use it,</v>

19
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Or use twitter when we use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

21
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>You know you have Newt Gingrich even now</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying we don't have white white</v>

22
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Americans don't understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of black Americans and that</v>

23
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>chasm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that gap and understanding has been one</v>

24
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 1>that the Internet is in large part</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for that.</v>

25
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge vocabulary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a set of symbols.</v>

26
00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I think of as an idiom</v>

27
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.460
<v Speaker 1>set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also a testimony about experience</v>

28
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.080
<v Speaker 1>that we weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that of each of each of us have each of</v>

29
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>us in different dialects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we weren't allowed or we,</v>

30
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have access to communally</v>
<v Speaker 1>share.</v>

31
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Now we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as some people say in this adolescence</v>

32
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with digital culture and we're trying</v>

33
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:03.734
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

34
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.100
<v Speaker 1>to determine what to do with this</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinitely polyglot culture speaks so</v>

35
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>many different languages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I was reading because why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading Henry James as account of</v>

37
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:21.581
<v Speaker 1>being at Ellis Island at the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the last century and his horror at</v>

38
00:02:22.251 --> 00:02:27.251
<v Speaker 1>what he calls the teaming and squirming</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive flooding onto into New York,</v>

39
00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.560
<v Speaker 1>which now we would see as politically</v>
<v Speaker 1>appalling,</v>

40
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:31.910
<v Speaker 1>as a level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

41
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.210
<v Speaker 1>of disgust that goes hand in hand with</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

42
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antiseptic right wing nativists</v>

43
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially coming from a waspy.</v>

44
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry James figure mirrors almost</v>

45
00:02:44.361 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>exactly the vocabulary that people use</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they describe twitter.</v>

46
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>When they described the youtube</v>
<v Speaker 1>comments.</v>

47
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>These people are illiterate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're angry,</v>

48
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:57.290
<v Speaker 1>they're squirming and teeming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a natural reaction to people who</v>

49
00:02:57.291 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>feel like they belong here and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>spaces being seized by people whose</v>

50
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 1>language they don't speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

51
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many,</v>

52
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 1>many ways alien to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the Internet shows us over and over</v>

53
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>again and the billions of us who use</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that exposure is not only necessary</v>

55
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>but good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but good for us.</v>

56
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 1>It's exposing our immune system to test</v>
<v Speaker 1>over and over to different means that</v>

57
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>confront our bodies the way microbes do</v>
<v Speaker 1>and raise our immune system.</v>

58
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Ask us to be more robust citizens.</v>
