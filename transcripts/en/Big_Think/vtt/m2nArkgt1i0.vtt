00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Many people come to me and they see how</v>
<v Speaker 1>courageous they see me.</v>

2
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And very often,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>maybe in shocking way I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't find myself courageous.</v>

4
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find myself passionate and I love what</v>

5
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I love what I do,</v>

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do it all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if I do it all day long,</v>

7
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I probably will be very good at it soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the story of my life.</v>

8
00:00:22.831 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not born,</v>

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the [inaudible] for example,</v>

10
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>where the wire walkers are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I learned by myself.</v>

11
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.480
<v Speaker 1>As I was learning all my arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>magic,</v>

13
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>juggling the high wire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing books,</v>

14
00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:47.440
<v Speaker 1>making films,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things.</v>

15
00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>I realize maybe by looking at performers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also by,</v>

16
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming one that the most powerful way</v>

17
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>to inspire people to touch in audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not to try to touch them,</v>

18
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 1>is to be yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you write a novel for what the people</v>

19
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>want to weed while you do a wider than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be an interested in.</v>

20
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.110
<v Speaker 1>But if you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you are divorced inside by a</v>

21
00:01:14.111 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 1>fire and then you need to write,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the painter needs to paint,</v>

22
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

23
00:01:19.331 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>then your work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>will be interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually some people may hate it.</v>

25
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Oh My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love it.</v>

26
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Which actually are distant cousins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more interesting than people</v>

27
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.991
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

28
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:32.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember that work of art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>but you will cause a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a human response much more,</v>

30
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>which that if you try to please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you try to,</v>

31
00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:39.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

32
00:01:39.331 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in performance,</v>

33
00:01:40.721 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>in show business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I hate that term.</v>

34
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>You see people on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a juggler,</v>

35
00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tried to make the people love the,</v>

36
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:50.530
<v Speaker 1>try to make them upload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by doing that,</v>

37
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 1>they take away from their art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

38
00:01:53.171 --> 00:01:55.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to find your own personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own style,</v>

39
00:01:55.631 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>and that takes sometimes a lifetime or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can copy people and that's,</v>

40
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artistic crime.</v>

41
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to go the easy way in to try to be a</v>

42
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>crowd pleaser at a very young age in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

43
00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>I realize that was a form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible].</v>
