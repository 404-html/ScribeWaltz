1
00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>What really launched my serious research</v>
<v Speaker 1>into network effects on the economics of</v>

2
00:00:09.691 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>network effects with some of the work</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was doing in human capital and</v>

3
00:00:13.891 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>the notion that innovation isn't just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>transaction.</v>

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Innovation is an investment in the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital and capabilities and</v>

5
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>competencies and creativity of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer's network.</v>

6
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:30.741
<v Speaker 1>Effects are basically how customers or</v>
<v Speaker 1>users create value for each other.</v>

7
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 1>It's basically an external to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual user.</v>

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>So an example of a network effect would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be if you and I had a phone that would</v>

9
00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>be great for you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in network effect is the more people</v>

10
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>who use phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more valuable the phone network</v>

11
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more valuable each other become</v>

12
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>because we can call more people and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can call us and heck,</v>

13
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>they may even be the opportunity to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conference call,</v>

14
00:01:01.771 --> 00:01:03.690
<v Speaker 1>which is another form of network effect.</v>

15
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.930
<v Speaker 1>So network effects are basically a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the more people participate in</v>

16
00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>using a product or service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more valuable it becomes.</v>

17
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing anymore as a non</v>
<v Speaker 1>networked organization.</v>

18
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:18.721
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admittedly,</v>

19
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>some networks are better than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can absolutely make the case that</v>

20
00:01:23.281 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>one of the fundamental transformations</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 50 years is the network</v>

21
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.470
<v Speaker 1>effication of large organizations and</v>
<v Speaker 1>small organizations,</v>

22
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>not just in OACD countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all over the world network</v>

23
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:41.511
<v Speaker 1>suffocation has taken over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how do you get value from these</v>

24
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>networks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a wonderful line from the,</v>

25
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>the first industrial sociologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Frenchman by the name of Frederick Law</v>

26
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the superintendent of a cold.</v>

27
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>The minds and his phrase was the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important product of the mine is the</v>

28
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>minor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the coal,</v>

29
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>it's not the metal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the 10 it's the human capital</v>

30
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>that allows you to extract the value</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the mind.</v>

31
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>So that's update this to the 21st</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

32
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>The most important product of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>network is the networker,</v>

33
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.100
<v Speaker 1>not the bits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the bites,</v>

34
00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.540
<v Speaker 1>not the bandwidth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the data.</v>

35
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>It's the people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in an Internet of things age,</v>

36
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 1>the things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the machines,</v>

37
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:31.221
<v Speaker 1>the devices on the network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we can make networkers more valuable,</v>

38
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.280
<v Speaker 1>we make our networks more valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is indeed the recipe for an</v>

39
00:02:37.951 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a google,</v>

40
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.430
<v Speaker 1>for a Yelp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a Linkedin,</v>

41
00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>for an at t,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and t for Netflix.</v>

42
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>What does Google do to make customers</v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

43
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives them the ability to search and</v>

44
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>iterate on those searches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does Google do?</v>

45
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.360
<v Speaker 1>It converts those clicks into more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient search.</v>

46
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>That's the essence of a web 2.0 network</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects company.</v>

47
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>The same holds for the Amazon</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommendation engine or for Netflix.</v>

48
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.920
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing is you're making it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

49
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>You're not just giving customers what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want,</v>

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>you're investing in improving their</v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities.</v>

51
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:19.741
<v Speaker 1>What was another way that Google did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Google gave you for free gmail</v>

52
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>email,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which enables it to learn more about</v>

53
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>your social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're interested in communicating</v>

54
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

55
00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with linkedin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the whole notion,</v>

56
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>that's why linkedin bought a company</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Linda.</v>

57
00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So not just to improve people's resume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to improve people's skills.</v>

58
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of a network effect here is</v>

59
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>as we give our customers the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do more for themselves,</v>

60
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>they can do more with us and on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

61
00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>So in the early days of the telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all you could do was talk to someone,</v>

62
00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:02.170
<v Speaker 1>then you could do a facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could do a conference call.</v>

63
00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Then there were these things called</v>
<v Speaker 1>modems that allowed you to send email.</v>

64
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>You are increasing the capability of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer,</v>

65
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>allowed you to get more value from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

66
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>And indeed customers want it to do so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

67
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:21.361
<v Speaker 1>You had to do what you had to redesign</v>
<v Speaker 1>the architectures and the capabilities</v>

68
00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>of the network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have an iterative network</v>

69
00:04:24.521 --> 00:04:29.521
<v Speaker 1>development process here as customer</v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities and capacities increase,</v>

70
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to change the capabilities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacities of the network and vice</v>

71
00:04:35.141 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>versa.</v>
