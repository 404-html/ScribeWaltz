1
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to say</v>

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.700
<v Speaker 2>the first thing everyone should ask</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves is what does it mean to be</v>

3
00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 2>realistic and is realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing as resigning.</v>

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:20.100
<v Speaker 2>The second thing is to acknowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>more is possible in your life that</v>

5
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:27.841
<v Speaker 2>almost anybody ever told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the third is to think about the</v>

6
00:00:33.071 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 2>following thought experiment which was</v>
<v Speaker 2>brought up by content.</v>

7
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 2>It's so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it very helpful,</v>

8
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 2>carved in discrete terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was the 18th century.</v>

9
00:00:45.371 --> 00:00:49.240
<v Speaker 2>He asks us to imagine a man who cannot</v>
<v Speaker 2>resist,</v>

10
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 2>says he can't resist temptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time he walks by a certain house,</v>

11
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a brothel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you put a gallows in front of the</v>

12
00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 2>brothel and he knew that he would go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be hung,</v>

13
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 2>the minute he walked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would find that he could resist</v>

14
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 2>temptation very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

15
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 2>so we all agree that love of life trumps</v>
<v Speaker 2>every other physical desire that you</v>

16
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:14.290
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>

17
00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.880
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's for sex or food or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>form of pleasure does it for you.</v>

18
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 2>Love of life is the basis of every other</v>
<v Speaker 2>pleasure.</v>

19
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Then imagine the same man is asked to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sign a letter condemning an innocent</v>

20
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:34.411
<v Speaker 2>person to death and he's threatened by</v>
<v Speaker 2>an unjust tyrant with death himself,</v>

21
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.580
<v Speaker 2>unless he cooperates in the innocent</v>
<v Speaker 2>man's death.</v>

22
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 2>And what concept is is none of us know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we would do in that situation.</v>

23
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Most of us would probably be cowards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all of us know what we should do and</v>

24
00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:55.951
<v Speaker 2>all of us therefore know that we would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be free to do the right thing and to</v>

25
00:01:56.231 --> 00:02:01.150
<v Speaker 2>refuse to participate in injustice even</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it would cost our own lives.</v>

26
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 2>And I think furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think everybody can perform that</v>

27
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've tried it out on a number of people.</v>

28
00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.520
<v Speaker 2>I think furthermore that everybody has</v>
<v Speaker 2>one hero either in real life or in</v>

29
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 2>fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they would like to be in at least</v>

30
00:02:15.791 --> 00:02:16.300
<v Speaker 2>one moment.</v>

31
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 2>You may think you can't live up to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

32
00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 2>but you have one person who you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>would act rightly in that situation.</v>

33
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 2>I think we should keep those people in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

34
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully being a good person doesn't</v>

35
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 2>involve sacrificing your life and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact,</v>

36
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:44.191
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it's easier to be good and</v>
<v Speaker 2>rather banal and simple way is that it</v>

37
00:02:46.241 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 2>is to go out in one great heroic</v>
<v Speaker 2>gesture.</v>

38
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 2>So I think the last thing in being a</v>
<v Speaker 2>good person that's important to</v>

39
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:55.060
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if evil can be banal and I think it can</v>

40
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 2>be goodness is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now to it consistent,</v>

41
00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>ordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday action.</v>
