1
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Gonna make me blush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

2
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>I was working for a gay organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was in a lesbian bar in Texas.</v>

3
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dallas and I,</v>

4
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was up until that point had a boyfriend,</v>

5
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.530
<v Speaker 1>thought I was completely straight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she hit on me.</v>

6
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>And I remember feeling very flattered </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a surprisingly interested.</v>

7
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.783
<v Speaker 1>She was confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was the confidence that </v>

8
00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:39.774
<v Speaker 1>really pulled me in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They surprised me because I have a </v>

9
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>master's degree in women's studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was in graduate school,</v>

10
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>I lived with a troop of drag kings and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.583
<v Speaker 1>I had been around the lesbian community </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years and was never interested in </v>

12
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>anyone in the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when this happened,</v>

13
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>I thought the question had already been </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled for me.</v>

14
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I was a straight ally working for a</v>

15
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>gay organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was working for glad at the time.</v>

16
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:22.560
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it surprised me and I went home and I</v>

17
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>called my sister and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this woman hit on me and I don't know,</v>

18
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I think I kind of liked it.</v>

19
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

20
00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>it's no big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've kissed lots of girls.</v>

21
00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>Who Cares?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>and she was straight also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was surprising too.</v>

24
00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

25
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember at the time it was a little,</v>

26
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>it was probably a little scary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing,</v>

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened that evening,</v>

28
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>but it got me thinking and it got me </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking in a very different way.</v>

29
00:01:58.381 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>And it sounds cheesy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really started,</v>

30
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:03.954
<v Speaker 1>I can remember driving down the street </v>
<v Speaker 1>and envisioning my life completely </v>

32
00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.893
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>envisioning getting married but to a </v>

33
00:02:12.751 --> 00:02:13.584
<v Speaker 1>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an envisioning having a life but with a </v>

34
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:19.650
<v Speaker 1>woman and coming home to a woman and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

35
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

36
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>it was like this door opened that hadn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>been opened before and I thought,</v>

37
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Huh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be my life.</v>

38
00:02:30.241 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed really exciting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

39
00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just made sense.</v>

40
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I had different experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that most people,</v>

41
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:42.954
<v Speaker 1>because I was working at a gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization and they for a couple of </v>

42
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>years had gotten used to me being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>the straight ally that work to the gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

44
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:51.644
<v Speaker 1>So I had to go there and sort of come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out in a reverse sense and say to </v>

45
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

46
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was straight too,</v>

47
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:59.880
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

48
00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was surprising.</v>

49
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.860
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember being very nervous and very,</v>

50
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>I felt a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.733
<v Speaker 1>I was proud to be a straight ally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>work at a gay organization and I felt </v>

52
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:16.564
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I carried a lot of responsibility to </v>

53
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:22.610
<v Speaker 1>sort of educate other straight people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and bring people in.</v>

54
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.483
<v Speaker 1>And so I felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there was some part of me that </v>

55
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>felt like I was maybe letting people </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

56
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>And then I got over that pretty quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and thought,</v>

57
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the whole point.</v>

58
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 1>This is what we're fighting for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is who I am.</v>

59
00:03:35.201 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were some people at work that were</v>

60
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

61
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>you're experimenting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

62
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>test it out.</v>

63
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:44.974
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sort of irked me a little bit </v>

64
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>because I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

65
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't just,</v>

66
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flaming,</v>

67
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

68
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>I think this is who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just shows that we all have,</v>

69
00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:00.543
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own biases and assumptions that we </v>

70
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>carry around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when I came out to my parents,</v>

71
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>I was very naive and my parents are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal.</v>

72
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dad was a retired as a school </v>

73
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:18.160
<v Speaker 1>superintendent and my mom was a social </v>
<v Speaker 1>worker and,</v>

74
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

75
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked at a black community center up in</v>

76
00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Syracuse and they were very liberal </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to every other,</v>

77
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of their friends,</v>

78
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>all of our neighbors.</v>

79
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>So I thought this would be a nonissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they had gay friends,</v>

80
00:04:35.471 --> 00:04:36.304
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom was the person at work who would </v>

81
00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>stand up for the gay guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've never heard my dad tell an anti</v>

82
00:04:42.581 --> 00:04:46.450
<v Speaker 1>gay joke or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I came out,</v>

83
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

84
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>I was very surprised because my mother </v>
<v Speaker 1>has such a traditional,</v>

85
00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>like reaction and she's not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional person,</v>

86
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 1>which was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

87
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to have kids.</v>

88
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a husband and have this life.</v>

89
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

90
00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not,</v>

91
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard you say things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

92
00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.843
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it took many years for her to </v>

93
00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.220
<v Speaker 1>eventually become okay with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

94
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>so it was a process and I didn't expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>it to be,</v>

95
00:05:19.091 --> 00:05:20.380
<v Speaker 1>so that was surprising.</v>

96
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.273
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
