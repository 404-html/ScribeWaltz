00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting.</v>

2
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm from New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like New York,</v>

4
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>but London is just cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really cool.</v>

5
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

6
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>really international.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredibly fun to walk around and</v>

7
00:00:21.301 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>you get lost really easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause it's impossible to,</v>

8
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no grid pattern.</v>

9
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>You can't find your way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as an American,</v>

10
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like a complete candy store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

11
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>It's just so new and different and</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

12
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you come back to New York,</v>

13
00:00:33.871 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>people are so relaxed and I like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaxed.</v>
