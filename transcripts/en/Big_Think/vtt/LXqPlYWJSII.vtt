1
00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.090
<v Speaker 1>What's an event?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a difficult question.</v>

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Not because we lack definitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because there are too many</v>

3
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>definitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my book,</v>

4
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>I focus on event in the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>something extraordinary takes place.</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>But with all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>a wide span of what we call an event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think an elementary structure can be</v>

7
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.420
<v Speaker 1>described in formal terms within a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain field of phenomena where things</v>

8
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:40.431
<v Speaker 1>go on the normal flow of things from</v>
<v Speaker 1>time to time something happens,</v>

9
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>which as it were retroactively changes</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules of what is possible in the</v>

10
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:53.541
<v Speaker 1>sense that something happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is generated by that situation.</v>

11
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's causally produced by that situation</v>

12
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>back in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes retroactively the whole</v>

13
00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle in the sense of the event</v>

14
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:11.721
<v Speaker 1>would have been an aspect which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>stronger than its own causes.</v>

15
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now come a couple of examples that I</v>

16
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>hope we will all like in literature.</v>

17
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.700
<v Speaker 1>Why is Kafka Franz Kafka the one that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all know and love and event?</v>

18
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Of course she has predecessors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can say that Kafka implicitly or</v>

19
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>explicitly relied on a whole series of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other artists like Edgar Allen Poe,</v>

20
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the story of Ski Visium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blake and so on.</v>

21
00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a simple as that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you try to isolate in those earlier</v>

22
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>authors what makes them predecessors of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kafka,</v>

23
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>you can see that that dimension Kafka</v>
<v Speaker 1>before Cafca is perceptive and only one</v>

24
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.771
<v Speaker 1>staff that is already here as a bar has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Argentinian writer as he put it in a</v>

25
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concise way.</v>

26
00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.370
<v Speaker 1>Truly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

27
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.920
<v Speaker 1>all authors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers have predecessors,</v>

28
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 1>a truly great writer in a way creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own past his own predecessors so</v>

29
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes there are people who influenced him,</v>

30
00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>but you can see this influence only once</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is here.</v>

31
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.070
<v Speaker 1>And now let me jump to a totally</v>
<v Speaker 1>different domains.</v>

32
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love in the good old fashion sense,</v>

33
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>which is today more and more rare love</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an encounter.</v>

34
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>This is why in English and also in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other language is not all like French.</v>

35
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>You use the term fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we fall in love.</v>

36
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 1>This is the eventful dimension in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense?</v>

37
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you live a happy life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are lucky.</v>

38
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 1>You have a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you meet regularly with French,</v>

39
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.980
<v Speaker 1>you are not in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you just make one night's 10th maybe</v>

40
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>here and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You meet every evening with friends you</v>

41
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:14.320
<v Speaker 1>drink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go to blah,</v>

42
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all of a sudden in a totally</v>

43
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>contingent way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say you stumbled on the streets,</v>

44
00:03:19.771 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>somebody helps you to stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a young girl or a boy,</v>

45
00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's the love of your</v>

46
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It totally contingent encounter,</v>

47
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.990
<v Speaker 1>but the result can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your whole life changes.</v>

48
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.220
<v Speaker 1>Nothing is the same as they say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You even spontaneously perceive your</v>

49
00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:49.261
<v Speaker 1>entire past life is leading towards this</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique moment.</v>

50
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the illusion of love is,</v>

51
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.290
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was waiting all my life for you.</v>

52
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>This something like this would have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>the love event.</v>

53
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's getting more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>rare today.</v>

54
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.160
<v Speaker 1>Many intelligent cultural critics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice how we are almost returning to</v>

55
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:17.641
<v Speaker 1>pre romantic premodern times when</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage or love connections were a</v>

56
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>matter of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 1>relatives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>counselors and so on.</v>

58
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Your uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own day selected whom you will</v>

59
00:04:27.551 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 1>marry and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

60
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.640
<v Speaker 1>it's similar only instead of all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>old twice uncles and so on,</v>

61
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.670
<v Speaker 1>it's dating agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage agencies,</v>

62
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>and shown and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we bought,</v>

63
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:44.341
<v Speaker 1>they offer us is precisely love without</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fall,</v>

64
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>without falling in love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without this totally unpredictable</v>

65
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>promatic encounter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I find very sad.</v>

66
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I think that today we are simply more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more afraid of this eventful.</v>

67
00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.470
<v Speaker 1>It counters you encounter something</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is totally contingent,</v>

68
00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>but the result of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you accept it as an event,</v>

69
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.250
<v Speaker 1>is that your entire life changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a different story.</v>

70
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why I think that this avoiding</v>

71
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:27.151
<v Speaker 1>falling in love is the same phenomenon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a standard joke that I use in my all</v>

72
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.570
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>almost all my books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know how we want to date the thing</v>

74
00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.480
<v Speaker 1>without the bad aspect of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without the price,</v>

75
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:39.520
<v Speaker 1>we have to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't,</v>

76
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>sugar without calories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have sweeteners.</v>

79
00:05:45.521 --> 00:05:49.630
<v Speaker 1>We want to be or without alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want and so on and so on.</v>

80
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>And I claim it's the same thing in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexuality.</v>

81
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>We want brief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>safe sex,</v>

82
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:01.410
<v Speaker 1>sexual without the fall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without this fake to attachment.</v>

83
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.370
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is the most set theme</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

84
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>the Tivan what is slowly emerging as</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe deeper dominant ideology.</v>

85
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I ironically referred to us,</v>

86
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>western Buddhism life is just a playoff</v>
<v Speaker 1>appearances.</v>

87
00:06:16.761 --> 00:06:19.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't take it too seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maintain appropriate.</v>

88
00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>These styles don't get too attached to</v>
<v Speaker 1>where Lee objects.</v>

89
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>It's fits perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this superficial consumerist attitude.</v>

90
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.010
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>events are rare.</v>

91
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.580
<v Speaker 1>An event is the traumatic encounters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which to put it in more learn</v>

92
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.550
<v Speaker 1>philosophical terms retroactively</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates its own costs.</v>
