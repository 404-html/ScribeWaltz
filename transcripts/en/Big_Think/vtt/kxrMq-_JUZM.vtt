00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.660
<v Speaker 1>There's a great saying that wikipedia</v>
<v Speaker 1>works really well in practice,</v>

2
00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:08.661
<v Speaker 1>just not in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is true wikipedia success is so</v>

3
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>singular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so spectacular that figuring out whether</v>

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a model for anything other than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wikipedia is a puzzle that even the</v>

5
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 1>folks behind Wikipedia have faced as</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've tried to do wiki search,</v>

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Wiki news and [inaudible] Harry at</v>
<v Speaker 1>different times,</v>

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of having a scheme where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the day to day governance,</v>

8
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>the day to day edits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether done for substance to improve</v>

9
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>the truth level of an article in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of the editor or done for process,</v>

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that edit shouldn't have been made a</v>

11
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>breaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The following rule,</v>

12
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to revert it to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people doing that be members of the</v>

13
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:49.761
<v Speaker 1>public at large is an extraordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>devolution of responsibility out to</v>

14
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:57.441
<v Speaker 1>people who are in one way or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>implicitly or explicitly sort of taking</v>

15
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:02.781
<v Speaker 1>an oath to subscribe to the principles</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind Wikipedia of neutrality,</v>

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>of fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of learning,</v>

17
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>kind of the values of the enlightenment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cannot survive itself over the long</v>

18
00:01:10.921 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>haul.</v>

19
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you get more and more importance</v>

20
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>attached to Wikipedia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more places that draw from</v>

21
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:22.521
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia as a source of data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's something like the Wolfram</v>

22
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Alpha knowledge engine or google to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assemble basic facts for results in a</v>

23
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be more and more reason for</v>

24
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:35.391
<v Speaker 1>entities to want to gain the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could just put yourself in the</v>

25
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Guinness Book of World Records for</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the longest beard or something</v>

26
00:01:37.741 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>and you don't actually have to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

27
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:39.841
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:39.841 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll vote myself rich.</v>

29
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>These are problems that wikepedia has</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to deal with so far,</v>

30
00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 1>relatively successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

31
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a level of humility that I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to maintain in order to recognize</v>

32
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>new problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to recognize where there might be</v>

33
00:01:56.821 --> 00:02:01.821
<v Speaker 1>structural forms of bias or</v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination going on and to be able</v>

34
00:02:03.451 --> 00:02:08.451
<v Speaker 1>to endure the more targeted intentional</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to basically poison the well of</v>

35
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>truth that wikipedia at least aspires to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

36
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.290
<v Speaker 1>What would I propose as a longer term</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of shoring it up?</v>

37
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>I think we should solve a problem with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem we haven't really figured out,</v>

38
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the early 21st century,</v>

39
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>what to do with kids who are in school</v>
<v Speaker 1>for hours at a time,</v>

40
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.860
<v Speaker 1>every day sort of warehoused in daycare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be wonderful to make as</v>

41
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>part of the curriculum from say sixth</v>
<v Speaker 1>grade onward,</v>

42
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>part of your task and it will be graded</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

43
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.220
<v Speaker 1>is to edit and make the case for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>edits to an article on a service like</v>

44
00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>wikipedia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll have new ranks of people</v>

45
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.390
<v Speaker 1>being supervised by teachers who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on the articles and on the</v>

46
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that may be even we'll apprentice to</v>

47
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the norms by which you have an argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>over what is true and what isn't.</v>

48
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And maybe some of them will choose to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue on his wikipedia guns,</v>

49
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even after the assignment is over.</v>

50
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>So to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I think of an advanced civics class,</v>

51
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.340
<v Speaker 1>it's great to learn that there are three</v>
<v Speaker 1>branches of government and you know,</v>

52
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>x vote gets you a veto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a overrides a veto.</v>

53
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>But having the civics of a collective</v>
<v Speaker 1>hallucination like wikipedia also be</v>

54
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>part of the curriculum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think would be valuable.</v>
