1
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me lay on you.</v>

2
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.840
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarianism is to me,</v>

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm speaking for myself,</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.930
<v Speaker 1>which is about as libertarian is you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe I know what's best for</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>I also don't believe that other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's best for other people.</v>

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>I can barely make decisions for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do my best to make decisions for my</v>

8
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shouldn't my 10 year old son take music</v>

9
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>lessons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard question for our family.</v>

10
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.810
<v Speaker 1>You want to push them into it or wait</v>
<v Speaker 1>until he really wants it.</v>

11
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>It was a hard decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have trouble making those for my</v>

12
00:00:48.981 --> 00:00:52.580
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so making the decision of what someone</v>

13
00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>else's job and healthcare should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

14
00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It was in another part of the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>who I've never met is not something I'm</v>

15
00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 1>qualified or desire is to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's libertarianism.</v>

16
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Libertarianism is taking a right on</v>
<v Speaker 1>money and your first left on sex and</v>

17
00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.740
<v Speaker 1>looking for utopia straight ahead to me.</v>

18
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 1>The way I was brought up western</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

19
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 1>kind of a New England philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we believed in responsibility and</v>

20
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>keeping your nose out of other people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

21
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.710
<v Speaker 1>We believed in live and let live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to a fault.</v>

22
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom and dad were older parents too.</v>

23
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>My mom was 45 and I was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was raised by another generation.</v>

24
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.223
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom was,</v>

25
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>my mom would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

26
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>120 now or 115 now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>whole of the generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mom was born.</v>

28
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to see that my math is</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

29
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>My mom was born in 1909.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>she's dead now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>so it's a whole different generation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my mom's feeling about absolutely</v>

32
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>everything was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares?</v>

33
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her whole feeling I'm the gay rights</v>

34
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:13.871
<v Speaker 1>movement was who cares who they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>get together with.</v>

35
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her whole feeling on drugs.</v>

36
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>I have never had a sip of alcohol or any</v>
<v Speaker 1>recreational drug in my life.</v>

37
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.330
<v Speaker 1>That was true for my mother too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my father too,</v>

38
00:02:23.331 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>for my sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many generations that</v>

39
00:02:25.251 --> 00:02:27.020
<v Speaker 1>goes back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never.</v>

40
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.680
<v Speaker 1>And yet my mom always thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

41
00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>any drugs should be legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're,</v>

42
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're living in a free country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want.</v>

43
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take responsibility for it.</v>

44
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.340
<v Speaker 1>When you tell people about</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism,</v>

45
00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just tell them we think you should</v>

46
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:50.051
<v Speaker 1>take as little from other people by</v>
<v Speaker 1>force as possible and you should be able</v>

47
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:55.811
<v Speaker 1>to do whatever you think is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's a pretty heavy thing I'm</v>

48
00:02:56.121 --> 00:03:01.121
<v Speaker 1>saying because I'm saying that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an 18 year old girl who was the</v>

49
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.720
<v Speaker 1>greatest math wiz that we have in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

50
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>let's say she's the smartest person at</v>
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>

51
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>We have anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's say we give her a full</v>

52
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>scholarship to go to whatever school she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go to,</v>

53
00:03:17.471 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Stanford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mit or wherever she wants to go.</v>

54
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>And she decides she wants to work at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's and get pregnant</v>

55
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.490
<v Speaker 1>at the age of 19.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's her decision.</v>

56
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Jim Morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did he have a worse life because he did</v>

57
00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:42.701
<v Speaker 1>an awful lot of drugs and died at 28.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

58
00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I've already lived a lot longer than Jim</v>
<v Speaker 1>Morrison.</v>

59
00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his choices worse than mine.</v>

60
00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.993
<v Speaker 2>I Dunno.</v>

61
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would not have liked to have lived</v>

62
00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:54.350
<v Speaker 1>like Jim Morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I'd like to look that good and</v>

63
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:56.330
<v Speaker 1>leather pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

64
00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurt cobain did that.</v>

65
00:03:59.601 --> 00:04:01.430
<v Speaker 1>I want to live like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

66
00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.850
<v Speaker 1>not even slightly prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to live like that.</v>

67
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

68
00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>they probably don't want to live like me</v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

69
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism is the strongest sense of</v>

70
00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.430
<v Speaker 1>please do what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Try not to hurt me.</v>

71
00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Our government has a monopoly on force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a monopoly on force.</v>

72
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 1>The government is the only organization</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is supposed to be able to use for</v>

73
00:04:32.301 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government is supposed to be a</v>

74
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:37.700
<v Speaker 1>government</v>
<v Speaker 1>of us,</v>

75
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.690
<v Speaker 1>which means in my thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my morality,</v>

76
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the government should only use force for</v>
<v Speaker 1>things I'm willing to use.</v>

77
00:04:46.761 --> 00:04:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Force for the government are the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that are allowed to use guns to</v>

78
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:55.250
<v Speaker 1>hurt another person or threatened</v>
<v Speaker 1>another person legally for the question</v>

79
00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:57.050
<v Speaker 1>becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would I use a gun</v>

80
00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:58.483
<v Speaker 2>to do?</v>

81
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a coward and I have no skills with</v>

82
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:04.990
<v Speaker 1>guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with violence.</v>

83
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>I've never hit a person in anger in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

84
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>I've been hit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never hit back.</v>

85
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.840
<v Speaker 1>So this is hypothetical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I were not a coward,</v>

86
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>would I use a gun to stop someone from</v>
<v Speaker 1>being killed?</v>

87
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he used a gun to stop from being</v>

88
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>raped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

89
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use a gun to build the library.</v>

90
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 1>I take money from someone to build the</v>
<v Speaker 1>library.</v>

91
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd certainly give my money.</v>

92
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>I certainly work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd certainly beg you for money to build</v>

93
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>the library.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Library's really mattered to me.</v>

94
00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was born in 55 and from a small town</v>

95
00:05:41.441 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>without a library,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have known nothing.</v>

96
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>I had to drive to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to ride my bike to the library to</v>

97
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:48.800
<v Speaker 1>learn about Lenny Bruce Franz Kafka.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>I got stravinsky records in the library</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant everything to me.</v>

99
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>A library is matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

100
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>that's the libertarian question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

101
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>taking care of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you use a gun to take care of</v>

102
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

103
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>that's a hard one because taxation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>using violence.</v>

104
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Now people try to say taxation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>voluntary.</v>

105
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't pay your taxes,</v>

106
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>eventually somewhere down the line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with a gun will show up.</v>

107
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>They just will some at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't do that.</v>

108
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do with our taxes?</v>

109
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 1>We used a gun to defend our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

110
00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I guess we got it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 1>but we use a gun for everything we use</v>
<v Speaker 1>for taxes.</v>

112
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 1>So when I see the government doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

113
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I asked myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would I use a gun to do that?</v>

114
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>Now all of that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a high level.</v>

115
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:53.290
<v Speaker 1>The theoretical part of libertarianism</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me in a nuts and bolts level becomes</v>

116
00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much simpler.</v>

117
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the cases where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is simpler than the,</v>

118
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:02.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the theory.</v>

119
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.520
<v Speaker 1>When someone's worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism,</v>

120
00:07:07.521 --> 00:07:10.070
<v Speaker 1>they worry about what happens to public</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>

121
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.670
<v Speaker 1>What happens to a welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens to roads?</v>

122
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 1>Those are the first three questions they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask.</v>

123
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And those are the hardest questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give you public schools.</v>

124
00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:28.190
<v Speaker 1>I will give you welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will give you infrastructure.</v>

125
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.880
<v Speaker 1>I will not give you the government using</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gun to take money from poor people and</v>

126
00:07:33.951 --> 00:07:38.951
<v Speaker 1>giving it to rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest issue in libertarianism is</v>

127
00:07:39.261 --> 00:07:44.240
<v Speaker 1>stopping corporate welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we give in welfare to the poor,</v>

128
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:46.940
<v Speaker 1>we give in government money to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>roads.</v>

129
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.030
<v Speaker 1>We give him money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Giving money to the schools is nothing</v>

130
00:07:50.031 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>compared to the money we give to rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

131
00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.180
<v Speaker 1>The best way to stop crony capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West way to stop graft,</v>

132
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.640
<v Speaker 1>the best way to stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

133
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:01.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

134
00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.910
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of bad stuff in government is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make government small enough.</v>

135
00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.300
<v Speaker 1>The way you stop corruption is make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>small enough to corruption.</v>

136
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give the government little enough that</v>

137
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:20.231
<v Speaker 1>there's not a lot to steal from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government is buoying up the rich</v>

138
00:08:21.981 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rich corporations love the</v>

139
00:08:24.801 --> 00:08:27.230
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gain the system in a way.</v>

140
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:31.370
<v Speaker 1>An individual never can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any big corporation has a team of the</v>

141
00:08:31.371 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>best lawyers to figure out how they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>not pay taxes.</v>

142
00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:38.560
<v Speaker 1>No middle class person has that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all,</v>

143
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>they have regulations set to keep other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people out of the business,</v>

144
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the manicure shops,</v>

145
00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to license,</v>

146
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>register everything so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that other people can't get in.</v>

147
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 1>It's limiting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a true free market,</v>

148
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you would not have the big mega</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

149
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism is not about rich white</v>

150
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>people getting a lot of money for</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations and leaving everybody else</v>

151
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:05.664
<v Speaker 1>to whistle.</v>

152
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Libertarianism is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not use the government to take</v>

153
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 1>money from poor people and middle class</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and give it to rich people</v>

154
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>because really that's all that's ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

155
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.710
<v Speaker 1>That's all that's ever happened in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>present,</v>

156
00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate.</v>

157
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:28.730
<v Speaker 1>We have somebody running for president</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we know for a fact lied,</v>

158
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 1>lied a lot less than other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know for a fact she lied and we know</v>

159
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:43.431
<v Speaker 1>for a fact that she is an insider and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that knows the way to play all the</v>

160
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.240
<v Speaker 1>games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

161
00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.990
<v Speaker 1>we also know that she knows what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>better for other people.</v>

162
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean know that she says and claims and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brags that she will do a lot of killing</v>

163
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:58.941
<v Speaker 1>of people overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also know that she is essentially,</v>

164
00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.870
<v Speaker 1>even if I've called her a liar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's essentially a good,</v>

165
00:10:03.871 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 1>honest person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she essentially has a good heart.</v>

166
00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.440
<v Speaker 1>She also has a 65% disapproval rating or</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher.</v>

167
00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 1>That's Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were two things that I always</v>

168
00:10:17.041 --> 00:10:21.780
<v Speaker 1>believed about modern politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was that</v>

169
00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 1>everyone who would ever run for a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>office was smarter than me.</v>

170
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing was there was no</v>
<v Speaker 1>one worse than Hillary Clinton.</v>

171
00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:36.000
<v Speaker 1>Both of those things have been disproven</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Donald Trump.</v>

172
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the good qualities I mentioned about</v>

173
00:10:43.281 --> 00:10:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump does not share.</v>

174
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:51.470
<v Speaker 1>He's not skilled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does not have as I far as I can tell</v>

175
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:53.900
<v Speaker 1>any compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

176
00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:56.050
<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:59.630
<v Speaker 1>does not have very much knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

178
00:10:59.631 --> 00:11:04.631
<v Speaker 1>he does have a weird kind of a charisma</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I cannot understand myself.</v>

179
00:11:04.671 --> 00:11:09.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to work on me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly demonstrative that he has</v>

180
00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:15.250
<v Speaker 1>a charisma that works for some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's willing to give easy answers</v>

181
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.580
<v Speaker 1>and being willing to give easy answers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in his case aren't answers,</v>

182
00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:21.440
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will fix it.</v>

183
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 1>We've got this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll fix it.</v>

184
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

185
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't get to say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to demonstrate how you're doing</v>

186
00:11:28.791 --> 00:11:33.791
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But both Hillary Clinton and Donald</v>

187
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>are very interested in getting a lot of</v>

188
00:11:38.541 --> 00:11:42.560
<v Speaker 1>power for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe Hillary Clinton wants that</v>

189
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:45.530
<v Speaker 1>power cause she thinks she knows what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>best for other people.</v>

190
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Let's refer back to me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's best for other</v>

191
00:11:49.071 --> 00:11:51.230
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also don't think she does either,</v>

192
00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but she believes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe heart's in the right</v>

193
00:11:53.711 --> 00:11:56.530
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Donald Trump knows there</v>

194
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:58.760
<v Speaker 1>are other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

195
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:02.010
<v Speaker 1>to be concerned about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he even knows that you've</v>

196
00:12:02.011 --> 00:12:06.850
<v Speaker 1>got those two and neither one of them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not fair to Hillary Clinton.</v>

197
00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is giving no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

198
00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.660
<v Speaker 1>theoretical policy ideas for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>government should run.</v>

199
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton is not giving enough for</v>
<v Speaker 1>my taste.</v>

200
00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's their bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to see</v>

201
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>not even a debate conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public conversation in front of as much</v>

202
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:26.460
<v Speaker 1>of America's wants to watch it.</v>

203
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary Johnson,</v>

204
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:36.760
<v Speaker 1>both paragons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both virtuous,</v>

205
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:39.670
<v Speaker 1>both honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both smart,</v>

206
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 1>both concerned about other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both his experience in government.</v>

207
00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And I want to hear Bernie Sanders say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.990
<v Speaker 1>lot of people in this country have</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble taking care of themselves.</v>

209
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>We need a strong infrastructure for</v>
<v Speaker 1>business to thrive.</v>

210
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.430
<v Speaker 1>We need to protect our country to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect the people around us.</v>

211
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>We need a big strong government with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good solid safety net that can take care</v>

212
00:13:07.451 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>of people and treat them with compassion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they better choices than some</v>

213
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:14.680
<v Speaker 1>individuals will make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a government were more</v>

214
00:13:14.681 --> 00:13:16.870
<v Speaker 1>qualified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can take care of those that</v>

215
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:20.560
<v Speaker 1>aren't and where we can keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations at bay and where we can</v>

216
00:13:20.561 --> 00:13:23.830
<v Speaker 1>keep some money out of politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we need.</v>

217
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And here's some examples of how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>get there from where we are.</v>

218
00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 1>Here are the the a checks and balances</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to put in place on,</v>

219
00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:32.170
<v Speaker 1>on corporations.</v>

220
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Here's what to do with campaign finance</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

221
00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Here's what we want to do with schools</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

222
00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Some of my ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to Gary Johnson to say,</v>

223
00:13:39.551 --> 00:13:41.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those things are problems,</v>

224
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:46.690
<v Speaker 1>but I think that maybe a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom as opposed to a little more</v>

225
00:13:46.691 --> 00:13:49.630
<v Speaker 1>control from the government might give</v>
<v Speaker 1>us a lot of that.</v>

226
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I want individuals to have a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>money in their pockets and use that for</v>

227
00:13:54.491 --> 00:13:58.360
<v Speaker 1>charity and use that for building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think instead of putting up</v>

228
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.690
<v Speaker 1>tariffs to keep foreigners foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses out,</v>

229
00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:04.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can actually make America more</v>

230
00:14:04.841 --> 00:14:06.230
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 1>less of less taxes and let them have</v>
<v Speaker 1>more power that way and be more</v>

232
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 1>successful and to be more money all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place.</v>

233
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:18.220
<v Speaker 1>We can take care of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that will work pretty well.</v>

234
00:14:18.221 --> 00:14:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And while we're at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll stop the corporations by not</v>

235
00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:23.350
<v Speaker 1>having a big government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flows money to them.</v>

236
00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.230
<v Speaker 1>And then Bernie Sanders says back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

237
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>that sounds really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gary really does.</v>

238
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 1>But there are some people who just plain</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be left out.</v>

239
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.460
<v Speaker 1>They're not gonna make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just not going to make it in</v>

240
00:14:36.461 --> 00:14:40.930
<v Speaker 1>your Doggie dog free market economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just got a little willing to throw</v>

241
00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:42.440
<v Speaker 1>them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Gary says,</v>

242
00:14:42.441 --> 00:14:43.274
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

243
00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.550
<v Speaker 1>maybe a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

244
00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>maybe a subsistence amount of money for</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

245
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just give him that money cause you know,</v>

246
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 1>compare to what we're playing for food</v>
<v Speaker 1>stamps and all of that stuff.</v>

247
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.660
<v Speaker 1>Just writing them a check as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>easier.</v>

248
00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 1>So maybe we can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Bernie says,</v>

249
00:14:59.751 --> 00:15:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you know what you're saying about</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping businesses over here kind of</v>

250
00:15:02.751 --> 00:15:04.190
<v Speaker 1>makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

251
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can do a few left less tariffs</v>

252
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.860
<v Speaker 1>and a little lower taxes to help our</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

253
00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that'll help a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go back and forth and they cope</v>

254
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:17.000
<v Speaker 1>with an impasse where they don't agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the American people say,</v>

255
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try it Bernie's way for awhile.</v>

256
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Let's give it four years of burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems like he,</v>

257
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.630
<v Speaker 1>he's got some ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go.</v>

258
00:15:26.631 --> 00:15:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Four years of burning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

259
00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a good guy.</v>

260
00:15:29.331 --> 00:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>You thought about this really hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a really good case and we know</v>

261
00:15:33.051 --> 00:15:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you're a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We like,</v>

262
00:15:34.121 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>can we trust you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're going with burning now.</v>

263
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.250
<v Speaker 1>And we tried that for awhile and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie's doing this?</v>

264
00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:42.020
<v Speaker 1>There's other people in the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>that go,</v>

265
00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.040
<v Speaker 1>what about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he pulls back on this and he adjusts</v>

266
00:15:45.041 --> 00:15:47.630
<v Speaker 1>and he does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he comes,</v>

267
00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:48.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

268
00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:52.910
<v Speaker 1>four years go by and the country goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's hear that debate again.</v>

269
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone else in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the hear the debate again</v>

270
00:15:56.181 --> 00:15:56.691
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

271
00:15:56.691 --> 00:15:59.330
<v Speaker 1>we tried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really feel your burn.</v>

272
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:02.480
<v Speaker 1>Now feel my Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have,</v>

273
00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.810
<v Speaker 1>we'll have Gary Johnson take over for</v>
<v Speaker 1>four years.</v>

274
00:16:05.811 --> 00:16:09.140
<v Speaker 1>See how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you go back and forth and you have a</v>

275
00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:14.000
<v Speaker 1>discussion of what we want to do as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country between two good,</v>

276
00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.940
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard thinking human beings.</v>

277
00:16:16.941 --> 00:16:20.810
<v Speaker 1>And please let's get one of them to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>woman by the next time we do this</v>

278
00:16:20.811 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's get someone to be of color.</v>

279
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.900
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do that.</v>

280
00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:29.780
<v Speaker 1>We've got plenty of people on both sides</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't just white guys.</v>

281
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.760
<v Speaker 1>But for right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my example,</v>

282
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie and,</v>

283
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:34.640
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Gary,</v>

284
00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.770
<v Speaker 1>and we go back and forth like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't we doing that?</v>

285
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Why do we have two people that all they</v>
<v Speaker 1>agree on is that they should have power</v>

286
00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.570
<v Speaker 1>to psychotic power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hungry,</v>

287
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.100
<v Speaker 1>hated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpleasant people clawing and scratching</v>

288
00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.320
<v Speaker 1>to take power over other people's lives?</v>

289
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Why not two people who are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a discussion about what direction</v>

290
00:17:01.611 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 1>our country should go in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

291
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.450
<v Speaker 1>we're never going to go all the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie.</v>

292
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 1>We're never going to go all the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary.</v>

293
00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:10.730
<v Speaker 1>But that's the discussion we have and</v>
<v Speaker 1>let that go.</v>

294
00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.910
<v Speaker 1>So that is what I think about modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

295
00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism.</v>

296
00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:19.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someday in the future we should go</v>

297
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:23.870
<v Speaker 1>to and arco capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someday in the future we should go</v>

298
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:26.900
<v Speaker 1>to full out socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for right now,</v>

299
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.760
<v Speaker 1>can we just do what every mother fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>American believes,</v>

300
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.880
<v Speaker 1>which is stop giving so much money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporations.</v>

301
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Let the people have more control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them spoke dope.</v>

302
00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Let them put what they want into their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bodies.</v>

303
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Let them have sex with whoever they want</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as there's consent.</v>

304
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And let them do that in every state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them love who they want and enjoy</v>

305
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:50.270
<v Speaker 1>life the way they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life,</v>

306
00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.370
<v Speaker 1>liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the pursuit of happiness.</v>

307
00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Is that enough position?</v>
