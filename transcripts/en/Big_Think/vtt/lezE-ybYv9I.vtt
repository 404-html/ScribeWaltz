00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I think one dilemma you always have is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a profession really depends on our being</v>

3
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:22.930
<v Speaker 2>able to publish our work in peer review</v>
<v Speaker 2>journals.</v>

4
00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.520
<v Speaker 2>So what gets published,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really been gone over with a fine</v>

5
00:00:27.521 --> 00:00:32.110
<v Speaker 2>tooth comb and so we review each other's</v>
<v Speaker 2>papers and</v>

6
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you have to decide when you have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict of interest or not.</v>

7
00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 2>And if someone's work is too close to</v>
<v Speaker 2>yours,</v>

8
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.830
<v Speaker 2>if they're a competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to stay away from it</v>

9
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 2>because there's an obvious conflict of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>

10
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.800
<v Speaker 2>a little bit less obvious if you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

11
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the people whose papers who wrote</v>

12
00:00:56.441 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 2>the papers from your lab there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former postdocs or students.</v>

13
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 2>I think that's also like a conflict of</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

14
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

15
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 2>there are gray areas work that's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>close to your work,</v>

16
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:14.380
<v Speaker 2>but I mean where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where do you draw the line of when it's</v>

17
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 2>okay to review someone else's work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We at a paper or a grant,</v>

18
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when is it not?</v>

19
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 2>And when it's self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a creeping in.</v>

20
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

21
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very important that the</v>

22
00:01:30.551 --> 00:01:35.551
<v Speaker 2>peer review process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this the best thing we have a that it</v>

23
00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:37.840
<v Speaker 2>be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as pure as possible.</v>

24
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 2>It's never going to be perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's worth thinking about.</v>

25
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.061
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

26
00:01:43.061 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 2>and it poses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poses dilemmas on a regular basis.</v>
