00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>None of us want a learning environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we feel threatened,</v>

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 1>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to be learning in</v>

3
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.760
<v Speaker 1>an environment where there are people</v>
<v Speaker 1>with semi,</v>

4
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever you call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assault rifles around me,</v>

5
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:20.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be learning in an</v>

6
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>environment where I have somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>openly misogynistic and yelling,</v>

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>misogynistic slurs at me all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so all of us want safe spaces for</v>

8
00:00:29.521 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not unusual.</v>

9
00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is where do we put the</v>

10
00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>borders on that and in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances in universities,</v>

11
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:43.971
<v Speaker 1>we've reached the point where we're so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dedicated to the idea of making sure</v>

12
00:00:44.491 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>everybody feels absolutely comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've shut down some people's</v>

13
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:53.391
<v Speaker 1>ability to speak and to think and to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond where comfort zones may be and</v>

14
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:59.490
<v Speaker 1>that's where it becomes a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is not the case that universities</v>

15
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:02.100
<v Speaker 1>should be places where you feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable all the time.</v>

16
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>Intellectually we're supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable.</v>

17
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>That's how we grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As one of my graduate school professors</v>

18
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't changed your mind lately,</v>

19
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>how do you know it's working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was a really good way</v>

20
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>to think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was.</v>

21
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>He said that to me when I was stuck in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular idea and I wasn't budging and</v>

22
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>he thought I was being obstinate and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

23
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Speaker 1>And I started thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe changing your mind isn't a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

25
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>but what's happening on a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>university campuses has an ocean.</v>

26
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>You come with your preexisting beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>about your identity,</v>

27
00:01:32.101 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>about the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no one's supposed to question that.</v>

28
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's very problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

30
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want right wing people on</v>

31
00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew I want everybody on campus.</v>

32
00:01:42.481 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I want everybody having the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational opportunities.</v>

33
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And I want the opportunity to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>have real conversations about different</v>

34
00:01:48.451 --> 00:01:50.580
<v Speaker 1>points of view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Getting them out in the open,</v>

35
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>airing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>them being able to have conversations,</v>

36
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>arguments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about data,</v>

37
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>thinking about evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about histories of justice.</v>

38
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>It allows us to have those conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that I think has integrity and</v>

39
00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>honesty and gets us somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if people have the attitude,</v>

40
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:07.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are allowed on campus,</v>

41
00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:09.030
<v Speaker 1>some people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people are allowed to speak,</v>

42
00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 1>some people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't really get us forward and</v>

43
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>certainly it is the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should not allow people to openly</v>

44
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>abuse each other verbally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.590
<v Speaker 1>in ways that are profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

46
00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>using the n word for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but beyond that,</v>

47
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>generosity in terms of allowing people</v>

48
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 1>to air ideas and giving everybody time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that so that we can have</v>

49
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>meaningful education.</v>

50
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 1>So there's over simplification of</v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

51
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:39.120
<v Speaker 1>The sort of idea of everybody is good or</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody is evil as opposed to there</v>

52
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>are some people who are kind of nasty</v>
<v Speaker 1>but did some useful work.</v>

53
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>There are some people are good but did</v>
<v Speaker 1>some terrible things.</v>

54
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Trying to inject some of that subtlety</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thinking historically thinking</v>

55
00:02:47.521 --> 00:02:50.880
<v Speaker 1>empirically would be a heck of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>better than doing simplistic identity</v>

56
00:02:50.881 --> 00:02:55.881
<v Speaker 1>politics where everybody gets devil</v>
<v Speaker 1>horns or an angel's halo and you account</v>

57
00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:00.330
<v Speaker 1>for that based on current ideas of who.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a good identity and what's a bad</v>

58
00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:02.730
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good way to think of.</v>
