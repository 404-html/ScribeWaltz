1
00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.860
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are,</v>

2
00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I think are four is the obvious</v>

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.600
<v Speaker 2>placed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4
00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and what's important to understand is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't require the United States.</v>

5
00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Viet Mommy's army stopped the</v>

6
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:26.060
<v Speaker 2>killing in Cambodia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Indian army stopped the killing in</v>

7
00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>east Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which became Bangladesh.</v>

8
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 2>The Tanzanian army shutdown the</v>
<v Speaker 2>murderous regime of Idi Amin in Uganda.</v>

9
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a UN force of 5,000 soldiers</v>

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 2>in Rwanda when the killing began and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>commander of that force told the</v>

11
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 2>secretary general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can stop this with 5,000 soldiers who</v>

12
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 2>did not have all of the high tech stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that American,</v>

13
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 2>the American army deploys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

14
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.850
<v Speaker 2>humanitarian intervention can be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

15
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you can work with a division of labor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to be the United States.</v>

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other regional associations,</v>

17
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.780
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries can,</v>

18
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 2>can do this work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should sometimes provide</v>

19
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>political support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should sometimes provide logistical</v>

20
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.230
<v Speaker 2>or financial support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

21
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.270
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't have to be American</v>
<v Speaker 2>troops.</v>

22
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>And clearly in the Sudan we cannot</v>
<v Speaker 2>invade another Muslim country.</v>

23
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 2>We are in no position morally or</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically to do that.</v>

24
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 2>So it would have to be somebody else who</v>
<v Speaker 2>went into.</v>
