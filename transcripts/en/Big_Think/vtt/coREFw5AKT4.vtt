1
00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.880
<v Speaker 2>well my great inspiration in my life or</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of two forces,</v>

3
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker 2>one was a religion which is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important,</v>

4
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 2>particularly for my mother and father,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also for the members of our family</v>

5
00:00:23.091 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 2>and has been incredibly important in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of my life,</v>

6
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly facing some of the real</v>

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.250
<v Speaker 2>challenging times that I've had to face</v>
<v Speaker 2>members of my family that had been lost</v>

8
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>and other kinds of tragedies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also the role of family.</v>

9
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 2>We were a large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a large family.</v>

10
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:47.921
<v Speaker 2>I was the youngest of nine the last to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come along a sat at the little table on</v>

11
00:00:49.191 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 2>the side of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Always had to battle to get my views</v>

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 2>across or to be able to express it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I had a extraordinary role models.</v>

13
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 2>My father who is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ambitious for his children and it was a</v>

15
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:09.611
<v Speaker 2>great to support her mother who was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>safe haven devoted to her faith and also</v>

16
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the love of history.</v>

17
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

18
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 2>her children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My older brothers who were a great</v>

19
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 2>heroes of mine and we're inspiring</v>
<v Speaker 2>figures all the way through my life.</v>

20
00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Also demonstrated to me that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>political process could work and could</v>

21
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 2>be responsive to people's needs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges.</v>

22
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 2>My sisters who in their own way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 2>we're not elected to any office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm also were very important in</v>

24
00:01:40.311 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 2>terms of their own commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 2>in expanding opportunity for people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My sister Eunice Shriver,</v>

26
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:53.021
<v Speaker 2>the founder Special Olympics now and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>144 countries and going to be a world a</v>

27
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.080
<v Speaker 2>focus in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in China.</v>

28
00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 2>And just a few weeks from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>my sister Jean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who worked for very special arts</v>

30
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 2>programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has been so important in helping</v>

31
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker 2>people with the disabilities and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are artists to work and collaborate</v>

32
00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

33
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 2>my other sisters and I was also inspired</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a,</v>

34
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an oldest sister rosemary who was</v>

35
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:24.461
<v Speaker 2>mentally retarded and she was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very important figure in our family.</v>

36
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.350
<v Speaker 2>And she was very included.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

37
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the earliest days I recognize the,</v>

38
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she was a rather special individual</v>

39
00:02:34.701 --> 00:02:37.560
<v Speaker 2>and I could see how my mother and father</v>
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>

40
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:39.470
<v Speaker 2>how my brothers and sisters reacted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

41
00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:44.150
<v Speaker 2>And I think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a extraordinary force in my</v>

42
00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 2>recognizing the value and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a special grace that individuals have</v>

45
00:02:51.111 --> 00:02:56.111
<v Speaker 2>that have a physical or challenges in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this instant mental retardation and the</v>

46
00:02:57.531 --> 00:02:59.300
<v Speaker 2>importance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 2>their value and what they could give to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the family.</v>

48
00:03:01.991 --> 00:03:04.730
<v Speaker 2>And also the recognition that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

<v Speaker 2>to our fellow citizens and to respond to</v>
