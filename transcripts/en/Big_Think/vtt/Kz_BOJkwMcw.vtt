00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.920
<v Speaker 1>The elements in a great recipe really</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

2
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to culture and each one will</v>

3
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.770
<v Speaker 1>give you a different answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think is a,</v>

4
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.670
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prime product as a chef,</v>

5
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I need to have the best that I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best that nature can give me in the</v>

6
00:00:25.771 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then my work as the chef is not to alter</v>

7
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>that have to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to exalt.</v>

8
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>So in doing that I may need some</v>
<v Speaker 1>condiments which is olive oil or butter</v>

9
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might need some seasoning to enhance</v>

10
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.410
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's sold spices or herbs,</v>

11
00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>but basically gave me good product from</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature and most of my work.</v>

12
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

13
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult.</v>

14
00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's difficult to isolate a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what I would like to say is that</v>

15
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>I love cooking and eating seasonally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

16
00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>following the season,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the bounty of the season</v>

17
00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>brained?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I enjoy that at the given time.</v>

18
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

19
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to really choose one MSA pasta</v>

21
00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have to be.</v>
