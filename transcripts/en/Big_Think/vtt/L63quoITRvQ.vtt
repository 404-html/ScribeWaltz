1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well human made,</v>

3
00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:15.771
<v Speaker 2>global warming is caused by changes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atmosphere which are due to burning</v>

4
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>primarily as we burn oil,</v>

5
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 2>gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and coal.</v>

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 2>This releases carbon dioxide to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere.</v>

7
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Carbon dioxide absorbs heat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation from the earth and that traps</v>

8
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 2>the heat radiation and makes the planet</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit warmer,</v>

9
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.590
<v Speaker 2>so we noticed that the world has warmed</v>
<v Speaker 2>up about one and a half degrees</v>

10
00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Fahrenheit in the last century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With most of that warming in the last 30</v>

11
00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:47.061
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there's now 387 parts per million</v>

12
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 2>of co two in the atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm 150 years ago it was 280,</v>

13
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 2>so it's increased by 107 ppm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we thought a few years ago was that</v>

14
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 2>it would probably be safe to let CEO to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go as high as 450 parts per million.</v>

15
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 2>The reason we thought that was that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that there were previous periods in</v>

16
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 2>the earth's history called interglacial</v>
<v Speaker 2>periods.</v>

17
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.510
<v Speaker 2>We're now in a warm interglacial period,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we have been in for about 12,000</v>

18
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there were prior periods when the</v>

19
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 2>earth was warmer than it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the planet was still pretty much the</v>

20
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:38.921
<v Speaker 2>way it is now</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we thought that it was then about a</v>

21
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.660
<v Speaker 2>degree or so Celsius,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is about two degrees Fahrenheit</v>

22
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 2>warmer than it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we thought that might be okay to be</v>

23
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:54.431
<v Speaker 2>that warm and 450 parts per million</v>
<v Speaker 2>would probably take us to that sort of</v>

24
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>climate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we now realize is that during</v>

25
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 2>those prior warm periods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sea level was about six or seven meters</v>

26
00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 2>higher than it is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also we see what's happening with</v>

27
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:12.611
<v Speaker 2>the current 387 parts per million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's already enough that the Arctic</v>

28
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:16.820
<v Speaker 2>sea ice is melting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mountain glaciers all around the world</v>

29
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 2>are melting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is going to affect the fresh water</v>

30
00:02:19.191 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 2>supply for billions of people.</v>

31
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.160
<v Speaker 2>The climate zones are shifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the southwest United States and</v>

32
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Mediterranean region are becoming hotter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and drier.</v>

33
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 2>Likewise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>

34
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:36.671
<v Speaker 2>so you see increased forest fires and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced water supplies in those regions.</v>

35
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Coral reefs are already under stress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to.</v>

36
00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Many of them are going to be lost if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>continue with increasing greenhouse</v>

37
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>gases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we realize already the 387 is</v>

38
00:02:49.491 --> 00:02:54.491
<v Speaker 2>actually two large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 350 parts per million is a more</v>

39
00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:59.621
<v Speaker 2>realistic target and that means we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have to phase out use of coal</v>

40
00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>over the next couple of decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we want to be able to get back to 350</v>

41
00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:06.530
<v Speaker 2>parts per million.</v>

42
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 2>We simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we look at the fossil fuels and we</v>

43
00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:17.360
<v Speaker 2>see how much carbon there is an oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas and coal,</v>

44
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.890
<v Speaker 2>and by far the largest is cold and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>know that we're going to use the oil and</v>

45
00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.210
<v Speaker 2>the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>

46
00:03:23.211 --> 00:03:27.470
<v Speaker 2>They're very convenient fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big pools are owned by Russia and</v>

47
00:03:27.471 --> 00:03:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are certainly going to sell that</v>

48
00:03:30.411 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 2>gas and oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we want to be able to get back to 350</v>

49
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:39.761
<v Speaker 2>parts per million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this huge coal reserves that we're</v>

50
00:03:40.101 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 2>going to have to leave in the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or we could burn the coal and capture</v>

51
00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:46.310
<v Speaker 2>the co two and put it back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ground,</v>

52
00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:49.550
<v Speaker 2>but that's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have to move beyond</v>

53
00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels sometime within the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>century anyway,</v>

54
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 2>so why not do it now and preserve a</v>
<v Speaker 2>climate that will allow our children and</v>

55
00:03:58.641 --> 00:04:03.410
<v Speaker 2>grandchildren to have the same sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet that we enjoy and with all of the</v>

56
00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:05.300
<v Speaker 2>species that are still on the planet.</v>
