1
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Kept trying to get this interview.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what could the second blank dollars</v>

3
00:00:10.451 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many houses can you you use private?</v>

4
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 2>How many jumps can you own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So give the,</v>

5
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:19.400
<v Speaker 2>give the rest of it away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if I were giving money away,</v>

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 2>I would probably give it mostly to</v>
<v Speaker 2>direct service providers as people</v>

7
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they're actually doing research say</v>

8
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 2>for giving me cancer research for AIDS</v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

9
00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:31.550
<v Speaker 2>The actual researchers and the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually providing on the ground</v>

10
00:00:31.551 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 2>services to peel because there's plenty</v>
<v Speaker 2>of think tanks.</v>

11
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of things that get a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of money to turn a lot of position</v>

12
00:00:37.911 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 2>papers and some of them are usable</v>
<v Speaker 2>position papers.</v>

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Board tend to be underfunded by private</v>
<v Speaker 2>donors today or people give him the</v>

14
00:00:43.881 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 2>services on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little things that aren't sexy.</v>

15
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Soup Kitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food closets,</v>

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.200
<v Speaker 2>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are desperately under funded by</v>

17
00:00:54.201 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>private donors or give to the big issues</v>
<v Speaker 2>that get something named after yourself</v>

18
00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:58.100
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>

19
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 2>I think if money mainly to causes like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and something else,</v>

20
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.240
<v Speaker 2>I think I might give away money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>establish writing programs,</v>

21
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing programs,</v>

22
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 2>especially in the inner city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but elsewhere as well in rural areas,</v>

23
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>places where a lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it can certainly go to school,</v>

24
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 2>they don't get the individual</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouragement to think about the</v>

25
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 2>possible you may have the talent to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer.</v>

26
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Let's try it out and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see you saying that people tend to</v>

27
00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>ride a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 of people think a lot and we need</v>

28
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People will think a lot and I'd like to</v>

29
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:26.060
<v Speaker 2>encourage that.</v>
