1
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.790
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't in the short term,</v>

2
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>it's not in the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has stabilized itself politically.</v>

3
00:00:11.881 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>It's economy is growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It controls huge oil and gas resources</v>

4
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.721
<v Speaker 1>at a point in time where prices are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>high and it is muscling its way around</v>

5
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its neighboring countries.</v>

6
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It's so called near abroad by</v>
<v Speaker 1>blackmailing and extorting and those</v>

7
00:00:25.831 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>governments such as Ukraine and Georgia</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth and even potentially</v>

8
00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:31.050
<v Speaker 1>sending troops to intervene and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

9
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>So in a way it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

10
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Russia is back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the longterm picture,</v>

11
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>obviously he's different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 1>in the long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long term picture is that they've lost a</v>

13
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 1>large chunk of their territory by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Judah,</v>

14
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their population is undergoing a</v>

15
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>staggering for you fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People talking about Italy,</v>

16
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing population decline.</v>

17
00:00:49.411 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Russia is probably the most steep in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole world.</v>

18
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose something like a 500,000 of</v>

19
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:59.910
<v Speaker 1>their population a year due to either</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration or death,</v>

20
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to various causes.</v>

21
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>So in the long term picture from that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view isn't very good.</v>

22
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also have a lot of Chinese</v>

23
00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>migration into the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the far east.</v>

24
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>So areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the Russian Far East</v>

25
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>territorially that are Russia on the map</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't look like Russia in person.</v>

26
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's a huge problem to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

27
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Then the authoritarian system isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily stable.</v>

28
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Oil prices aren't necessarily going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be this high forever.</v>

29
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.720
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of reasons why the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>resurgence is really just a blip and the</v>

30
00:01:30.721 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>longer term picture of Russian decline</v>
<v Speaker 1>very much still holds.</v>

31
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe already does encroach on Russia's</v>

32
00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.940
<v Speaker 1>territory in the sense that between NATO</v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion and EU expansion,</v>

33
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>they more or less are up against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>borders of Russia,</v>

34
00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the Baltic countries they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the relationship with Ukraine,</v>

35
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>which is deepening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is also getting it in that direction as</v>

36
00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:57.070
<v Speaker 1>well as at the countries of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>caucuses,</v>

37
00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Georgia and Armenia and Azerbaijan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So gradually Europe is certainly</v>

38
00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 1>encroaching on Russia as much as Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>would serve as much as Russia would like</v>

39
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>to be encroached on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And D in Finland,</v>

40
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>there was a debate about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to have with NATO and the</v>

41
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:13.420
<v Speaker 1>EU and whether to actually deepen those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ties,</v>

42
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 1>yet more evidence of how like it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Russia basically is left with only</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and a diminishing influence</v>

44
00:02:21.191 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>outside its own borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuclear weapons are still there.</v>

45
00:02:24.281 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>It has the second largest nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal in the world,</v>

46
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.710
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

47
00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>not the weapon of choice in the 21st</v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

48
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia only has two major population</v>

49
00:02:35.231 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>centers or economic hubs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it obviously faces serious</v>

50
00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 1>retaliation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the last country in the world that</v>

51
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>would be wise to use nuclear weapons</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be roger.</v>
