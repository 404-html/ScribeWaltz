1
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Is anyone here knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She just generally by raise of hands,</v>

2
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:23.901
<v Speaker 1>how many people were present before she</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell the Chinese journalists in 2004,</v>

3
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government distributed</v>
<v Speaker 1>document 11 to Chinese news agents</v>

4
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.370
<v Speaker 1>around the country telling them to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover the 15th anniversary of the</v>

5
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Tiananmen Square massacre</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

6
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>had a meeting where a document level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disgust,</v>

7
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:47.580
<v Speaker 1>he took those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>type them up and then set them off to a</v>

8
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:52.581
<v Speaker 1>New York based Pro Democracy Ngo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She acts with not just one of the</v>

9
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was also an effort to undermine</v>

10
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>the propaganda by a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>by an infested regime.</v>

12
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.870
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that she does cover is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which the Chinese</v>

13
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>government thinks about censorship as</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers who are thinking about a day.</v>

14
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm very politically contentious</v>
<v Speaker 1>moments.</v>

15
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>They raised the dam to pay very close</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to what's going on.</v>

16
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.820
<v Speaker 1>And during liberal periods they let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

17
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously you're an anniversary of the</v>

18
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 1>canvas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but messenger is a pretty contentious</v>

19
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>pack and they're going to be paying very</v>
<v Speaker 1>close attention.</v>

20
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.780
<v Speaker 1>So for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you send an email with the year 1989</v>

21
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>as your username,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to pay attention to</v>

22
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're sending state secrets about a</v>

23
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>documentary revealing of propaganda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strategy to have political opponent,</v>

24
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to pay attention to that.</v>

25
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 1>They picked up a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she passed email and they asked Yahoo to</v>

26
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>reveal the user information for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>email address from a very tiny second.</v>

27
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.830
<v Speaker 1>We know she has ip address,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know she tells a email.</v>

28
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:18.291
<v Speaker 1>This email was sent from a Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 1>address because</v>

29
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>God gave it over to the state security</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparatus and she had was condemned to</v>

30
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>10 years in prison where he is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a real question about how</v>

31
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.810
<v Speaker 1>should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as United States citizens as residents</v>

32
00:02:39.811 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Speaker 1>of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we react to the United States.</v>

33
00:02:44.611 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>Congress had one answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a series of hearings and the</v>

34
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>inquiries into this during the Sciatica</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was less than forthcoming.</v>

35
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 1>And those hearings culminated in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>northerly anxious tongue lashing by a</v>

36
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.750
<v Speaker 1>representative in the WHO's has</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular experience with oppressive</v>

37
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.320
<v Speaker 1>regimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Representative Lantos,</v>

38
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>the only surviving member of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress.</v>

39
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

40
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:10.693
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

41
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.380
<v Speaker 2>conquer</v>
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

42
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
<v Speaker 2>game</v>
<v Speaker 2>Herrmann I by the night</v>

43
00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 2>jumping</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the matter would not all</v>

44
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.590
<v Speaker 2>what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I really don't believe that way that</v>

45
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 2>would</v>
<v Speaker 2>lead</v>

46
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.470
<v Speaker 2>me</v>
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

47
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.040
<v Speaker 2>say that we haven't tightened up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole lot better than me.</v>

48
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>You don't have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole lot better.</v>

49
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 2>And like I understand that comment</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>

50
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 2>I</v>
<v Speaker 2>have the highlight</v>

51
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 2>in an environment that is very cool</v>

52
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.750
<v Speaker 1>said to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>police,</v>

53
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>which pretty much everyone agreed with</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the actual tickets.</v>

54
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are currently facing a similarly</v>

55
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 1>complex situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be enough</v>

56
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.940
<v Speaker 1>as issued a circular which we don't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>access to perhaps because of that have</v>

57
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>been translated in English perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it hasn't made its way out of</v>

58
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the circular.</v>

59
00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>It's bloggers from creating posts which</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government says incite violence or</v>

60
00:05:33.971 --> 00:05:38.971
<v Speaker 1>crime undermine national security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including inaccurate information or</v>

61
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.970
<v Speaker 1>disclose eight secrets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the real question,</v>

62
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are really two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is,</v>

63
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>should we ask stakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>residence,</v>

64
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.640
<v Speaker 1>attempt to change the situation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to protect the privacy</v>

65
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 1>information of medicines who are based</v>
<v Speaker 1>in are going to break it down to right</v>

66
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something everyone is going to be</v>

67
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 1>able to answer on their own in their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>teams and the second half of this</v>

68
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question I'm going to try to explain</v>

69
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the answers to is what we can do.</v>

70
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>If we say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should change.</v>

71
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should go and attempt to use every</v>

72
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 1>power that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every course that we have to protect the</v>

73
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>privacy of political dissidents in</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

74
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 1>So the funnel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our thoughts on this,</v>

75
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna have to defer to professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lawrence Lessig who lays out for</v>

76
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.710
<v Speaker 1>metaphors for regulating the content of</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow of human behavior on the Internet</v>

77
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>because it's obviously a challenge as to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether these categories are distinct</v>

78
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.810
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.280
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely learned often as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>learned in law school,</v>

80
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.330
<v Speaker 1>but these are the basic or factors that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want or that I suggest all of you</v>

81
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:59.320
<v Speaker 1>think about in determining what your</v>
<v Speaker 1>team's solution is going to lead to.</v>

82
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 1>This problem and what you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone's collective solution should be</v>

83
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 1>for the problem that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce the second half of the class</v>

84
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 1>norms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

85
00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.660
<v Speaker 1>law and code.</v>

86
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>Have you guys another 10 seconds just to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look through it.</v>

87
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>If there's any questions on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel free to raise them right now.</v>

88
00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.770
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess we're pretty familiar with this</v>

89
00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>framework.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll move on to the global network</v>

90
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:26.030
<v Speaker 1>initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local network initiative as a sort of</v>

91
00:07:26.031 --> 00:07:31.031
<v Speaker 1>voluntary guidelines which the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies a specific signatory,</v>

92
00:07:31.521 --> 00:07:36.521
<v Speaker 1>Jerry Yang will get harangued by</v>
<v Speaker 1>representative who they sign onto a</v>

93
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>series of principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines and a framework for going</v>

94
00:07:42.441 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>documenting and streamlining the process</v>

95
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.190
<v Speaker 1>by which they interact with the pressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines who request private information</v>

96
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:54.410
<v Speaker 1>of otherwise anonymous for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>individuals with pseudonyms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political dissidents in trunk while</v>

98
00:07:58.910 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>we're political dissidents and across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

99
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're gonna start with whatever</v>

100
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:10.640
<v Speaker 1>condition and hopefully by discussing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the details and getting into the</v>

101
00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>language of this framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can massage out some of the benefits</v>

102
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:16.630
<v Speaker 1>and tensions of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:17.683
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

104
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>so we started off with three basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of the global network</v>

105
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of principles,</v>

106
00:08:23.031 --> 00:08:27.280
<v Speaker 1>which are general aspirations and goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideals of the signatories,</v>

107
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:31.340
<v Speaker 1>Google and Yahoo have signed onto this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bending implementation guidelines</v>

108
00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.750
<v Speaker 1>which are the real meat and potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the specifics which these companies have</v>

109
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.480
<v Speaker 1>agreed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this framework by the way,</v>

110
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 1>it was set up as a negotiation between</v>
<v Speaker 1>academics,</v>

111
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>these companies and human rights groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned.</v>

112
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.750
<v Speaker 1>And then finally the governance</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountability and learning framework.</v>

113
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>A plan for putting this framework into</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion over what is now the next four</v>

114
00:08:53.721 --> 00:08:58.090
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to just start off with a</v>

115
00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.830
<v Speaker 1>basic understanding of how these</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>

116
00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.190
<v Speaker 1>the principles are founded upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least with respect to privacy.</v>

117
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:06.740
<v Speaker 1>Privacy principles are kind of two basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims.</v>

118
00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.560
<v Speaker 1>A two basic assertions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that privacy is a human right to</v>

119
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:14.090
<v Speaker 1>privacy is a guarantor of human dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From here,</v>

120
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the guys move on to a series of ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ideals about what,</v>

121
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:24.490
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what these companies are aspiring to be.</v>

122
00:09:24.491 --> 00:09:25.324
<v Speaker 1>A part</v>

123
00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.830
<v Speaker 1>starts off with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone should be free from illegal</v>

124
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary interference with the right to</v>
<v Speaker 1>privacy and should have the right to the</v>

125
00:09:33.981 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>protection of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

126
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.140
<v Speaker 1>such interference or a test,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

127
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Privacy should not be restricted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments excepted narrowly defined</v>

128
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.890
<v Speaker 1>circumstances based on getting actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized laws and standards and these</v>

129
00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:48.680
<v Speaker 1>restrictions should be consistent with</v>
<v Speaker 1>international human rights.</v>

130
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Now he's principles are so wide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so broad in terms of what we can imagine</v>

131
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:59.960
<v Speaker 1>their applicability to be that they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>inevitably going to be somewhat watered</v>

132
00:09:59.961 --> 00:10:02.240
<v Speaker 1>down when we get to the real specifics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

133
00:10:02.241 --> 00:10:07.241
<v Speaker 1>just by highlighting this principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a g and I framers were telling us these</v>

134
00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:13.010
<v Speaker 1>are not specific to which we should hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>these Internet companies accountable.</v>

135
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Those specifics are going to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any implementation guidelines still</v>

136
00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:20.360
<v Speaker 1>there is something to point out in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of watering down</v>

137
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.640
<v Speaker 1>shaded in gray except the narrowly</v>
<v Speaker 1>defined a circumstance.</v>

138
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.090
<v Speaker 1>The face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm internationally recognized</v>

139
00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:29.450
<v Speaker 1>standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so on the one hand the principals</v>

140
00:10:29.451 --> 00:10:31.640
<v Speaker 1>generally close the door on privacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>invasions,</v>

141
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.990
<v Speaker 1>but they always open windows and whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not you think this is a good tactic</v>

142
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:38.960
<v Speaker 1>in terms of what kind of Lsd you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to prep,</v>

143
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.620
<v Speaker 1>what kind of approach you want to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>to solve the problem,</v>

144
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:48.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's up to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the things that I thought</v>

145
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>was important to flag and the principal</v>
<v Speaker 1>section will be on implementation</v>

146
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:54.560
<v Speaker 1>guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just important to take a</v>

147
00:10:54.561 --> 00:10:57.890
<v Speaker 1>look at the kind of language which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>implementation guidelines to use.</v>

148
00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.390
<v Speaker 1>This is just a section of implementation</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines,</v>

149
00:11:02.391 --> 00:11:05.120
<v Speaker 1>just like I like the kind of language of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses a,</v>

150
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:08.810
<v Speaker 1>so they're going to receive and evaluate</v>
<v Speaker 1>regular reports for management.</v>

151
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>We're going to review and they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to participate in training.</v>

152
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.170
<v Speaker 1>All of these words are rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjective.</v>

153
00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.450
<v Speaker 1>What does review mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does receive mean?</v>

154
00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.650
<v Speaker 1>What is participating in ultimately that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is determined by WHO's interpreting it.</v>

155
00:11:24.651 --> 00:11:29.210
<v Speaker 1>These are voluntary guidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have anything to just specific words</v>

156
00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:34.390
<v Speaker 1>might or might not have an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we saw in Lauren's less extreme work,</v>

157
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.720
<v Speaker 1>he's will certainly affect norms that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially will affect markets.</v>

158
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:43.430
<v Speaker 1>Therefore in terms of what he see these</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet companies doing and me hold</v>

159
00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:48.431
<v Speaker 1>them up to certain norms either by</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaming them or by using our power as</v>

160
00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:51.830
<v Speaker 1>consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to determine how effective</v>

161
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the wording is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any implementation guidelines.</v>

162
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>So that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've given out a packet to everyone and</v>

163
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.280
<v Speaker 1>I want you to take a look at the privacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>section of the implementation guidelines</v>

164
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 1>now that you have a sense not only of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the principals but also the general</v>

165
00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:07.950
<v Speaker 1>approaches the implementation guidelines</v>
<v Speaker 1>take.</v>

166
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I want you to read through those privacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>guidelines and judge for yourself how</v>

167
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:15.760
<v Speaker 1>effective they are and whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would change the approach when you</v>

168
00:12:15.761 --> 00:12:20.260
<v Speaker 1>have a chance to do what they've done in</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 40 minutes.</v>

169
00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.970
<v Speaker 1>We'll give you guys about a minute and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half to do that.</v>

170
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so moving on,</v>

171
00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:42.060
<v Speaker 1>we're going to move onto the global</v>
<v Speaker 1>online freedom act,</v>

172
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:47.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a legislative attempts to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>law to create a different approach that</v>

173
00:12:48.291 --> 00:12:50.800
<v Speaker 1>solves the same problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

174
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:56.170
<v Speaker 1>so the global online freedom act was</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced by representative Chris Smith</v>

175
00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:00.350
<v Speaker 1>and it uses a rather more objective</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach to a certain degree.</v>

176
00:13:00.351 --> 00:13:03.590
<v Speaker 1>That might be because of the negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>language that these groups cannot do</v>

177
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.671
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

178
00:13:04.671 --> 00:13:07.010
<v Speaker 1>it might be because a judge would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpreting,</v>

179
00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:11.210
<v Speaker 1>locate elective or obtain personally</v>
<v Speaker 1>identifiable information,</v>

180
00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:13.963
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

181
00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:20.900
<v Speaker 1>global online freedom that does run</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the State Department,</v>

182
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>which only recently has raised a Snafu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a bit of an obstacle to the</v>

183
00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:29.630
<v Speaker 1>enforcement of the globe on my freedom</v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

184
00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.530
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only been asked the past in the</v>

185
00:13:31.531 --> 00:13:36.531
<v Speaker 1>house was not passing the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's not long and that's that the</v>

186
00:13:36.561 --> 00:13:40.100
<v Speaker 1>secretary of state has explicitly said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that human rights are going to be</v>

187
00:13:40.101 --> 00:13:42.500
<v Speaker 1>secondary to economic survival during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the recession.</v>

188
00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:46.830
<v Speaker 1>So that is one slight snafu with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with gofundme as,</v>

189
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:52.170
<v Speaker 1>as it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it only highlights certain</v>

190
00:13:52.641 --> 00:13:56.180
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others through Ethiopia I read and</v>

191
00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.900
<v Speaker 1>specifically Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a problem in America,</v>

192
00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.970
<v Speaker 1>which I will go straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they help quite a bit in general</v>

193
00:14:04.971 --> 00:14:05.804
<v Speaker 1>what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I</v>

194
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:11.990
<v Speaker 1>know sometimes on this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you generally illustrates is</v>

195
00:14:11.991 --> 00:14:15.640
<v Speaker 1>that our own country has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for major invasions of</v>

196
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:19.670
<v Speaker 1>privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The NSA most recently has been sued by</v>

197
00:14:19.671 --> 00:14:24.671
<v Speaker 1>the Electronic Frontier Foundation for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>series of more into wiretap and is it</v>

198
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.300
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we really being consistent,</v>

199
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:31.400
<v Speaker 1>fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is it just something that we want to</v>

200
00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:36.401
<v Speaker 1>do to create a law that only applies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries when our country might</v>

201
00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:41.450
<v Speaker 1>be said to have binding</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the very end.</v>

202
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to sum up by just saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the four general forces that</v>

203
00:14:47.631 --> 00:14:50.210
<v Speaker 1>you should think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attorneys not only analyzing these two</v>

204
00:14:50.211 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>solutions but also crafting your colon</v>

205
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:54.660
<v Speaker 3>and with that we're going to move onto</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guest</v>

206
00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:00.740
<v Speaker 3>is managing director of the Burqa and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sack the cofounder of the information</v>

207
00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:04.010
<v Speaker 3>technology group at Harvard Centers for</v>
<v Speaker 3>International Development in teaching a</v>

208
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:06.030
<v Speaker 3>course this semester on the technology</v>
<v Speaker 3>and politics,</v>

209
00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.710
<v Speaker 3>Internet control,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was very involved in the crafting</v>

210
00:15:09.711 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 3>of the global network initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew Mclaughlin,</v>

211
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:18.220
<v Speaker 3>which we are trying to prepare early</v>
<v Speaker 3>connect with over skype for to Jack is</v>

212
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 3>joining us from the left coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the head of the global public</v>

213
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:24.870
<v Speaker 3>policy at Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>NC,</v>

214
00:15:24.871 --> 00:15:27.590
<v Speaker 3>your council there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he has also taught at Harvard and is</v>

215
00:15:27.591 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 3>a senior fellow at the Berkman Center.</v>

216
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.600
<v Speaker 3>So I guess we're going to start our</v>
<v Speaker 3>questions with column and the first one</v>

217
00:15:38.601 --> 00:15:41.660
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you think the optimal use case</v>

218
00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:46.720
<v Speaker 3>is for the Dni and against what</v>
<v Speaker 3>situations is it built to work that</v>

219
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.270
<v Speaker 3>well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So first,</v>

220
00:15:50.271 --> 00:15:51.250
<v Speaker 3>if I could just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

221
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:56.660
<v Speaker 3>thank you guys for inviting me here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure this will provide a lot more</v>

222
00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:00.860
<v Speaker 3>than my normal environment inside of</v>
<v Speaker 3>asking you to gentle.</v>

223
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm not used to being taken apart by the</v>
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>

224
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>important to let you know that I'm</v>

225
00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:10.700
<v Speaker 3>speaking on my own behalf.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not officially in anywhere.</v>

226
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:15.660
<v Speaker 3>So we've done part of what we have and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what a lot of us to create.</v>

227
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:20.680
<v Speaker 3>The sort of trust that we have is</v>
<v Speaker 3>through a great deal of caution with to</v>

228
00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:24.820
<v Speaker 3>speaking on behalf of the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These were my experience.</v>

229
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:30.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so kind of before it gets to your</v>

230
00:16:30.081 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 3>question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can I kind of just reflect on a few</v>

231
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.560
<v Speaker 3>points in that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Please do.</v>

232
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 3>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really wanted to highlight one which I</v>

233
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 3>thought was really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of the focus on aspirational</v>

234
00:16:40.161 --> 00:16:44.720
<v Speaker 3>language and to say that that was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a very intentional tension that</v>

235
00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:47.710
<v Speaker 3>we introduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're sort of on one hand saying what</v>

236
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.830
<v Speaker 3>can we aspire to and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>

237
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.350
<v Speaker 3>what's something that's realistically</v>
<v Speaker 3>implementable and ultimately verifiable.</v>

238
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:59.590
<v Speaker 3>So I think you're pulling out tension in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beginning as a suite of documents as</v>

239
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:05.531
<v Speaker 3>well as see</v>
<v Speaker 3>that particular thing in that that in</v>

240
00:17:07.341 --> 00:17:10.970
<v Speaker 3>particular is important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the question is,</v>

241
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.420
<v Speaker 3>what's the ideal case?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the ideal use case?</v>

242
00:17:14.421 --> 00:17:15.254
<v Speaker 3>One?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is the,</v>

243
00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:19.370
<v Speaker 3>there a specific case that he's looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>over?</v>

244
00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.490
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fine.</v>

245
00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Speaker 3>I guess I should say</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

246
00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:33.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll start off with a question for you</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

247
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:37.830
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about human rights in general and your,</v>

248
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.140
<v Speaker 3>these packs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

249
00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.900
<v Speaker 3>if you'd like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

250
00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:52.610
<v Speaker 3>So where thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We often talk as if there are,</v>

251
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:53.863
<v Speaker 3>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:58.970
<v Speaker 3>big categories as repetitive companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Does it,</v>

253
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.590
<v Speaker 3>does it simplify things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254
00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.670
<v Speaker 3>tend to refer to just google different</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

255
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:09.140
<v Speaker 3>or</v>
<v Speaker 3>should we,</v>

256
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:10.890
<v Speaker 3>should we try it aggravated</v>

257
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.480
<v Speaker 4>state?</v>
<v Speaker 4>She and I,</v>

258
00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:20.050
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

259
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.730
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it</v>

260
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:35.250
<v Speaker 4>was both of us decided to do business in</v>
<v Speaker 4>China</v>

261
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:43.860
<v Speaker 4>town experience and Microsoft find that</v>
<v Speaker 4>itself has been subjected to Chinese</v>

262
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 4>content controls on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a locally hosted service,</v>

263
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:53.230
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which,</v>

264
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.930
<v Speaker 4>which I don't think it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

265
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.660
<v Speaker 4>was that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

266
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.460
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

267
00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:03.360
<v Speaker 4>any one of these companies trying to</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tino the government on its own is</v>

268
00:19:03.361 --> 00:19:08.170
<v Speaker 4>basically at a massive disadvantage and</v>
<v Speaker 4>so worth it was a,</v>

269
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.210
<v Speaker 4>we try to aggregate together a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 4>market capital behind a basic set of</v>

270
00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:19.670
<v Speaker 4>principles and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can say in all honesty that this,</v>

271
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.260
<v Speaker 4>this thing was my idea to begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I can say what I was thinking when</v>

272
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:28.140
<v Speaker 4>you started this off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the original idea was that there was one</v>

273
00:19:28.141 --> 00:19:33.141
<v Speaker 4>principal that I thought mattered and</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the idea that if we could get</v>

274
00:19:33.541 --> 00:19:38.541
<v Speaker 4>the companies to read too insistent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one basic rule of law process or</v>

275
00:19:40.231 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 4>censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'd be able to introduce an element of</v>

276
00:19:44.071 --> 00:19:47.670
<v Speaker 4>accountability and also transparency in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the censorship system.</v>

277
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:52.110
<v Speaker 4>So you got remember from a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 4>global perspective for a company like</v>

278
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.670
<v Speaker 4>Google anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what Chinese,</v>

279
00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 4>what China does is an extreme form of</v>
<v Speaker 4>lots of student.</v>

280
00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:04.380
<v Speaker 4>It's actually isn't an Obama in Europe</v>
<v Speaker 4>this week.</v>

281
00:20:04.381 --> 00:20:08.370
<v Speaker 4>I gave a really interesting answer to a</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of snarky administrating this</v>

282
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:12.420
<v Speaker 4>question about American exceptions and</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that he noted,</v>

283
00:20:12.421 --> 00:20:15.300
<v Speaker 4>which is absolutely true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that one of the things that is very</v>

284
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:18.630
<v Speaker 4>exceptional than the United States or in</v>
<v Speaker 4>freedom of speech,</v>

285
00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:24.110
<v Speaker 4>we are in a global context and extreme</v>
<v Speaker 4>outlier when it comes to detection,</v>

286
00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.240
<v Speaker 4>meaning speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fair to say that there's no one to</v>

287
00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:31.250
<v Speaker 4>country which isn't really a metal all</v>
<v Speaker 4>as protected as the US is of dissidence</v>

288
00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:37.970
<v Speaker 4>expression of uncomfortable expression</v>
<v Speaker 4>of last expression and certainly even</v>

289
00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Canada or Australia countries which are</v>
<v Speaker 4>in many ways culturally quite similar to</v>

290
00:20:43.621 --> 00:20:46.240
<v Speaker 4>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>engage in Ireland,</v>

291
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.210
<v Speaker 4>sponsored censorship in content in a way</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be recently a</v>

292
00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.810
<v Speaker 4>unconstitutional in United States.</v>

293
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:53.793
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

294
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:55.960
<v Speaker 4>so anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many new roles.</v>

295
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.560
<v Speaker 4>We as a company have gotten into your</v>
<v Speaker 4>commute censorship in Germany and</v>

296
00:20:59.561 --> 00:21:02.230
<v Speaker 4>France,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brazil and the UK countries,</v>

297
00:21:02.231 --> 00:21:06.700
<v Speaker 4>which are democracies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in which competed successive</v>

298
00:21:06.701 --> 00:21:09.940
<v Speaker 4>elective ordinance validated by the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ballot box,</v>

299
00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.860
<v Speaker 4>have voted to moser maintain a</v>
<v Speaker 4>censorship machines.</v>

300
00:21:14.861 --> 00:21:18.820
<v Speaker 4>So in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in classify broadcast content,</v>

301
00:21:18.821 --> 00:21:21.730
<v Speaker 4>they've extended that stream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Theo in Canada,</v>

302
00:21:21.731 --> 00:21:26.731
<v Speaker 4>they're a national content rules will</v>
<v Speaker 4>use to suppress speech from outside</v>

303
00:21:27.401 --> 00:21:29.600
<v Speaker 4>Canada and prepare the speech inside</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canada.</v>

304
00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:33.670
<v Speaker 4>Germany suppresses a bouncy related</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

305
00:21:33.671 --> 00:21:35.670
<v Speaker 4>extreme violence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

306
00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.360
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>world,</v>

307
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:40.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evocations to go work.</v>

308
00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

309
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.280
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate Fox News would probably be</v>

310
00:21:45.281 --> 00:21:47.030
<v Speaker 4>illegal in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

311
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.180
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

312
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.861
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

313
00:21:48.861 --> 00:21:49.500
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

314
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.530
<v Speaker 4>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he,</v>

315
00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:52.660
<v Speaker 4>there are lots of jurisdictions where</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to do this.</v>

316
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.220
<v Speaker 4>And what's different about training</v>
<v Speaker 4>horses that aids our democracy and the,</v>

317
00:21:57.430 --> 00:22:00.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the range of speech that is suppressed,</v>

318
00:22:00.301 --> 00:22:05.301
<v Speaker 4>there goes well beyond sort of narrow</v>
<v Speaker 4>defined categories to the arbitrary and</v>

319
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:09.450
<v Speaker 4>unpredictable a range of subjects that</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

320
00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.970
<v Speaker 4>that they choose to suppress and</v>
<v Speaker 4>experience has shown that in China is,</v>

321
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.610
<v Speaker 4>it's actually a short winded zone.</v>

322
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:20.290
<v Speaker 4>What is censored is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is much less today than it was say 10 or</v>

323
00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:22.710
<v Speaker 4>12 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe even five or six years now.</v>

324
00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:24.640
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there still is a broad range of</v>

325
00:22:24.641 --> 00:22:28.000
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The shorthand of it use the,</v>

326
00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:29.110
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

327
00:22:29.111 --> 00:22:34.000
<v Speaker 4>a three season two teats or um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

328
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.240
<v Speaker 4>are three t's and Tuesday's Tiananmen</v>
<v Speaker 4>Square massacre.</v>

329
00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I wanted dependence to independence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first C is with</v>

330
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:45.490
<v Speaker 4>the last one is criticism with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>communist party's says central</v>

331
00:22:45.491 --> 00:22:46.690
<v Speaker 4>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

332
00:22:46.691 --> 00:22:48.700
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those are the things that really got a</v>

333
00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:52.420
<v Speaker 4>internet content blocks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

334
00:22:52.421 --> 00:22:54.510
<v Speaker 4>the problem is that there's no rule of</v>
<v Speaker 4>law to.</v>

335
00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.760
<v Speaker 4>So if we leave aside the differences in</v>
<v Speaker 4>political systems for a second and say,</v>

336
00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what really distinguishes German</v>

337
00:23:00.551 --> 00:23:03.430
<v Speaker 4>censorship from Chinese censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what answer is that?</v>

338
00:23:03.431 --> 00:23:06.490
<v Speaker 4>German censorship happens in an</v>
<v Speaker 4>accountable framework that's very well</v>

339
00:23:06.491 --> 00:23:09.270
<v Speaker 4>documented.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The law follows the rule sets.</v>

340
00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:10.211
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

341
00:23:10.211 --> 00:23:14.240
<v Speaker 4>in Germany there's a body,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a governmental body which produces a</v>

342
00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 4>black list.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are Else,</v>

343
00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.750
<v Speaker 4>is subject to oversight from different</v>
<v Speaker 4>parts of the government so that they can</v>

344
00:23:19.751 --> 00:23:22.390
<v Speaker 4>make sure that this apple beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 4>range of things that supposed to be</v>

345
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:25.810
<v Speaker 4>blocking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's got 12 experts from outside the</v>

346
00:23:25.811 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 4>agency that participative decision</v>
<v Speaker 4>making and presumably could be</v>

347
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:31.840
<v Speaker 4>whistleblowers and there was something</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad going on.</v>

348
00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:33.100
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

349
00:23:33.101 --> 00:23:36.550
<v Speaker 4>the black dust itself is not published</v>
<v Speaker 4>for fairly obvious reasons,</v>

350
00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:37.810
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

351
00:23:37.811 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 4>the process by which it's implemented,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty transparent.</v>

352
00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.680
<v Speaker 4>So I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one alternative.</v>

353
00:23:44.740 --> 00:23:47.750
<v Speaker 4>The Chinese alternative though is</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's rule of law.</v>

354
00:23:47.751 --> 00:23:50.760
<v Speaker 4>It's basically an individual decision</v>
<v Speaker 4>being accountable.</v>

355
00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:53.340
<v Speaker 4>You're not documentation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>

356
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.670
<v Speaker 4>I cannot make the GI initially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I say,</v>

357
00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.080
<v Speaker 4>because I first cooked it up was that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should try to get as much</v>

358
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.360
<v Speaker 4>accumulated market capital in the tech</v>
<v Speaker 4>sector,</v>

359
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.620
<v Speaker 4>media sector and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

360
00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.880
<v Speaker 4>broadly speaking in the information</v>
<v Speaker 4>center and try to get them all to agree</v>

361
00:24:10.881 --> 00:24:12.500
<v Speaker 4>to one second principle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

362
00:24:12.501 --> 00:24:17.501
<v Speaker 4>that really does follow a censorship</v>
<v Speaker 4>requests on Chinese in services and</v>

363
00:24:19.521 --> 00:24:21.490
<v Speaker 4>actually follow the formal one.</v>

364
00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.840
<v Speaker 4>So not for Prom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not somebody just sending you an</v>

365
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.610
<v Speaker 4>employee to a meeting and yelling at</v>
<v Speaker 4>them to block something.</v>

366
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.020
<v Speaker 4>But if model document that's been signed</v>
<v Speaker 4>off by court,</v>

367
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:34.010
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and again,</v>

368
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:39.540
<v Speaker 4>this could be usefully transformative at</v>
<v Speaker 4>least in some small way and that</v>

369
00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 4>requires some official to attach their</v>
<v Speaker 4>name to an order that follows legal</v>

370
00:24:44.361 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 4>process at least on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And therefore there's a chain of</v>

371
00:24:48.441 --> 00:24:50.840
<v Speaker 4>accountability built in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something gets why you can look at</v>

372
00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.210
<v Speaker 4>seafood was that ordered it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that the fuels,</v>

373
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.090
<v Speaker 4>the range of censorship in China right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now is that,</v>

374
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:00.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can never really tell it's complete</v>

375
00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.740
<v Speaker 4>black box.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The outside world ordered what and for</v>

376
00:25:03.741 --> 00:25:06.080
<v Speaker 4>what purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that was the original idea.</v>

377
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:10.160
<v Speaker 4>I'm just one question to ask was better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

378
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.800
<v Speaker 4>it should take.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's largely failed in that</v>

379
00:25:12.801 --> 00:25:17.060
<v Speaker 4>because the only two companies that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking on Google or Yahoo and Microsoft,</v>

380
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.320
<v Speaker 4>there are a couple others that I hope to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see getting into the fall by the</v>

381
00:25:21.730 --> 00:25:24.500
<v Speaker 4>stampede and any interest in players</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it's,</v>

382
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.980
<v Speaker 4>this set of rules has not really</v>
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>

383
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 4>And I think the rule set became a quite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a bit more prescriptive than what I just</v>

384
00:25:32.061 --> 00:25:36.670
<v Speaker 4>outlined because we also wanted to move</v>
<v Speaker 4>on your recipes others and actually</v>

385
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.170
<v Speaker 4>wanting to push the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

386
00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:42.620
<v Speaker 4>a formal requirements on participating</v>
<v Speaker 4>companies because they thought they</v>

387
00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:45.830
<v Speaker 4>sorta had to companies over a barrel</v>
<v Speaker 4>because congressional criticism,</v>

388
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:48.730
<v Speaker 4>pleasure stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

389
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 4>and so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's something that I broke is going</v>

390
00:25:50.931 --> 00:25:55.490
<v Speaker 4>to be useful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it definitely has not lived up to be</v>

391
00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.830
<v Speaker 4>the second vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was the other question you</v>

392
00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.580
<v Speaker 4>mentioned google basically the same as</v>
<v Speaker 4>apple,</v>

393
00:26:01.581 --> 00:26:02.950
<v Speaker 4>Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

394
00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not.</v>

395
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

396
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:07.400
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are much for,</v>

397
00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:12.040
<v Speaker 4>were much more conservative than the</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries that we opened up our</v>

398
00:26:12.041 --> 00:26:16.280
<v Speaker 4>operations in a much more conservative</v>
<v Speaker 4>about the kinds of services that we</v>

399
00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:18.950
<v Speaker 4>deploy and how we deploy it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So in China,</v>

400
00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:21.770
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't locate any personally</v>

401
00:26:21.771 --> 00:26:24.570
<v Speaker 4>identifiable data inside China,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

402
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.340
<v Speaker 4>which is critical because even though it</v>
<v Speaker 4>means that our services are quite a bit</v>

403
00:26:28.341 --> 00:26:29.560
<v Speaker 4>slower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

404
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.030
<v Speaker 4>it means that if the Chinese government</v>
<v Speaker 4>never wanted to get personally</v>

405
00:26:32.031 --> 00:26:35.450
<v Speaker 4>identifiable data from us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would have to go and file formal</v>

406
00:26:35.451 --> 00:26:38.710
<v Speaker 4>legal process through something called a</v>
<v Speaker 4>mutual legal assistance treaty.</v>

407
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.120
<v Speaker 4>You are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which means that it goes government to</v>

408
00:26:41.121 --> 00:26:44.510
<v Speaker 4>government from China to the US,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is Davis,</v>

409
00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:45.343
<v Speaker 4>Ashley Stewart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

410
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 4>and then the US Justice Department is</v>
<v Speaker 4>involved with the same thing.</v>

411
00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.160
<v Speaker 4>We,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gauging cooperation.</v>

412
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:56.070
<v Speaker 4>One of the critical things would be what</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Chinese government is going to use</v>

413
00:26:56.071 --> 00:26:58.930
<v Speaker 4>this data for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a political dissident or is it a</v>

414
00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.060
<v Speaker 4>child?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pornographer?</v>

415
00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.820
<v Speaker 4>Both are possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>US would obviously,</v>

416
00:27:02.821 --> 00:27:05.810
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the cooperate in an</v>
<v Speaker 4>investigation of the latter than the</v>

417
00:27:05.850 --> 00:27:07.120
<v Speaker 4>former.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

418
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.230
<v Speaker 4>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

419
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:13.250
<v Speaker 4>that's sort of what I know that a</v>
<v Speaker 4>powerpoint that you sent around with,</v>

420
00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:17.190
<v Speaker 4>you were talking about Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the announced example country where we</v>

421
00:27:17.191 --> 00:27:21.030
<v Speaker 4>offer Vietnamese language services.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We offer them on adopt 10 domain name,</v>

422
00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:26.490
<v Speaker 4>but we don't actually have any employees</v>
<v Speaker 4>or operations inside China that's</v>

423
00:27:26.841 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 4>probably different from who was a</v>
<v Speaker 4>Microsoft.</v>

424
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.420
<v Speaker 4>Microsoft sells software,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the girls.</v>

425
00:27:33.421 --> 00:27:35.340
<v Speaker 4>And so their online division to</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>

426
00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 4>I'm piggybacking off of this physical</v>
<v Speaker 4>presence for us,</v>

427
00:27:39.361 --> 00:27:43.820
<v Speaker 4>we can be a lot more deliberative about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it and they're chosen to be a separate.</v>

428
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 4>There are basically two things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're extremely focused in any country</v>

429
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:54.000
<v Speaker 4>where we're going to put people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is access to user data and the</v>

430
00:27:54.001 --> 00:27:57.110
<v Speaker 4>second one is censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we study a,</v>

431
00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:58.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of study the hell out of those two</v>

432
00:27:58.861 --> 00:28:01.830
<v Speaker 4>questions before we make any decisions</v>
<v Speaker 4>about weeds.</v>

433
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:05.500
<v Speaker 4>We're a data service facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>storage facilities,</v>

434
00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.410
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

435
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all different illusions country by</v>

436
00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:12.320
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will say on the censorship score then</v>

437
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 4>what has been extremely challenging is</v>
<v Speaker 4>that because we pulled from the United</v>

438
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there is no country which means us</v>

439
00:28:19.411 --> 00:28:22.760
<v Speaker 4>levels of protection for free speech.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a single one anywhere in the</v>

440
00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.350
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every country that you go to this got</v>

441
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:30.430
<v Speaker 4>subject each control or at least</v>
<v Speaker 4>attempts through instruments like the</v>

442
00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:36.461
<v Speaker 4>liability provisions that goes beyond</v>
<v Speaker 4>what would be acceptable know and</v>

443
00:28:36.811 --> 00:28:37.680
<v Speaker 4>kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

444
00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 4>it's libel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>defamation laws,</v>

445
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:41.080
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

446
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:46.470
<v Speaker 4>and they just act as in order to do a</v>
<v Speaker 4>rules of the liability.</v>

447
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 4>They act as the speech control games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that again,</v>

448
00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:51.450
<v Speaker 4>was just a difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

449
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're looking at a country.</v>

450
00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.130
<v Speaker 4>So for me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's exactly accompanied view,</v>

451
00:28:56.131 --> 00:29:00.360
<v Speaker 4>but a critical distinguishing factor has</v>
<v Speaker 4>been about which countries have</v>

452
00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 4>democratic systems which are capable of</v>
<v Speaker 4>correcting errors over time.</v>

453
00:29:05.730 --> 00:29:10.080
<v Speaker 4>So there's that I don't like about</v>
<v Speaker 4>speech restriction laws in India,</v>

454
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 4>let's say a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm comfortable with Google doing</v>

455
00:29:12.961 --> 00:29:16.190
<v Speaker 4>business in India because when it needs</v>
<v Speaker 4>to state,</v>

456
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:21.200
<v Speaker 4>which it sometimes does in the form of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>police arresting somebody who posted the</v>

457
00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:26.880
<v Speaker 4>Oregon community that was critical as</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody for example,</v>

458
00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:31.820
<v Speaker 4>is of course incredibly dismaying that</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody would be arrested on the basis</v>

459
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.460
<v Speaker 4>of criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the other hand,</v>

460
00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.620
<v Speaker 4>a ideas democratic system for all of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a force.</v>

461
00:29:37.970 --> 00:29:40.650
<v Speaker 4>It's a very robust wine in one with the</v>
<v Speaker 4>court system,</v>

462
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.350
<v Speaker 4>which at the top level is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've already,</v>

463
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 4>this institution have a tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of integrity,</v>

464
00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:51.200
<v Speaker 4>a partial decision making and is likely</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be able to prevent errors as into</v>

465
00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:56.080
<v Speaker 4>mature system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think the profession is probably</v>

466
00:29:56.081 --> 00:29:58.690
<v Speaker 4>unrealistic aiming for something which</v>
<v Speaker 4>is workable,</v>

467
00:29:58.910 --> 00:29:59.651
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

468
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:01.280
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is more realistic and try,</v>

469
00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:02.650
<v Speaker 4>just try some kind of balance.</v>

470
00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so one of the things Andrew mentioned</v>

471
00:30:08.511 --> 00:30:13.130
<v Speaker 3>that is that ai is only all has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>going by too much.</v>

472
00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:18.220
<v Speaker 3>The company.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that a metric to access your.</v>

473
00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:23.420
<v Speaker 3>So it is a new prevail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't have to be arrogant.</v>

474
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:28.950
<v Speaker 3>Are we to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>differences between people or companies</v>

475
00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.320
<v Speaker 3>or how would you</v>
<v Speaker 3>respond to that?</v>

476
00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:38.930
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say that the official launch of</v>

477
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:42.380
<v Speaker 3>the materials,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is to say the documents referred</v>

478
00:30:42.381 --> 00:30:45.230
<v Speaker 3>to in the presentation was in October of</v>
<v Speaker 3>2008.</v>

479
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.760
<v Speaker 3>A public launch was in December of 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

480
00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:51.980
<v Speaker 3>we have ongoing conversations with</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably 20 companies.</v>

481
00:30:51.981 --> 00:30:56.930
<v Speaker 3>We've had a whole host of other kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>non-company participants,</v>

482
00:30:56.931 --> 00:30:58.780
<v Speaker 3>which pushes me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

483
00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.320
<v Speaker 3>academics and gos and investment groups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of the social responsible</v>

484
00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:07.160
<v Speaker 3>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a lot more folks that</v>

485
00:31:07.161 --> 00:31:09.170
<v Speaker 3>we're likely to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that we've been</v>

486
00:31:09.171 --> 00:31:14.171
<v Speaker 3>involved in is in drafting precisely the</v>
<v Speaker 3>governance charter and the terms by</v>

487
00:31:14.271 --> 00:31:15.890
<v Speaker 3>which you can become a member.</v>

488
00:31:15.890 --> 00:31:19.190
<v Speaker 3>So the idea was not that any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anyone would just join up.</v>

489
00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:22.520
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to establish that they were</v>

490
00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.910
<v Speaker 3>committed to this venture and to making</v>
<v Speaker 3>it a success.</v>

491
00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.550
<v Speaker 3>One of the things that each of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies that have been leading up to</v>

492
00:31:28.551 --> 00:31:32.750
<v Speaker 3>now I've demonstrated through their</v>
<v Speaker 3>longterm commitment and meaningful</v>

493
00:31:32.751 --> 00:31:36.140
<v Speaker 3>engagement and actions and willingness</v>
<v Speaker 3>to address this stuff publicly.</v>

494
00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:40.010
<v Speaker 3>A number of different ways that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>really care about making this work and</v>

495
00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:42.130
<v Speaker 3>that's person not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a very strong.</v>

496
00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.240
<v Speaker 3>There will be accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's other mechanisms,</v>

497
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.370
<v Speaker 3>but a very strong signal to their</v>
<v Speaker 3>success or their seriousness with which</v>

498
00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.680
<v Speaker 3>when they're done with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I had the other thing I would say</v>

499
00:31:51.681 --> 00:31:55.040
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so Andrew referred to one sort of</v>

500
00:31:55.041 --> 00:31:57.620
<v Speaker 3>differences among the companies that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>participating now.</v>

501
00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:00.850
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I would say is that indeed the</v>

502
00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:05.020
<v Speaker 3>point since the beginning has been to</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to get a broader range because now</v>

503
00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.040
<v Speaker 3>admittedly we have not succeeded in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>regard.</v>

504
00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:10.520
<v Speaker 3>We did have a series of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other,</v>

505
00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:15.580
<v Speaker 3>other Internet service provider,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mobile provider and telco types from</v>

506
00:32:17.421 --> 00:32:21.650
<v Speaker 3>Europe primarily involved in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>drafting process,</v>

507
00:32:21.651 --> 00:32:23.900
<v Speaker 3>but the variety of reasons didn't end up</v>
<v Speaker 3>signing on,</v>

508
00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:26.400
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we remain in good contact with them and</v>

509
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.700
<v Speaker 3>never kind of sorta considered we'll see</v>
<v Speaker 3>what happens in long term,</v>

510
00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:33.470
<v Speaker 3>but the plan had been and remains to</v>
<v Speaker 3>ensure diversity and the diversity of</v>

511
00:32:33.471 --> 00:32:38.040
<v Speaker 3>the company so that you don't have folks</v>
<v Speaker 3>using one kind of technology or one sort</v>

512
00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 3>of business are operating in one</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

513
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:44.300
<v Speaker 3>But rather a mix so you don't end up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with technology specific or region</v>

514
00:32:44.301 --> 00:32:48.850
<v Speaker 3>specific solutions that would not be as</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaningful or as a,</v>

515
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:54.190
<v Speaker 3>it would be sort of a to two specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course there's the risk of becoming</v>

516
00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 3>too broad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that will allow for some sort of</v>

517
00:32:56.391 --> 00:32:58.010
<v Speaker 3>nuance in terms of meditation.</v>

518
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:02.690
<v Speaker 3>So I'm going for people in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your challenge is to get in not just</v>

519
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:04.010
<v Speaker 3>American companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is key,</v>

520
00:33:04.011 --> 00:33:04.650
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we're going,</v>

521
00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.010
<v Speaker 3>we claim to be anything like approaching</v>
<v Speaker 3>global,</v>

522
00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.630
<v Speaker 3>a drawing on the ICC bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New EHR is not so willing to have,</v>

523
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 3>not just companies with global reach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but companies that have values based on</v>

524
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:18.970
<v Speaker 3>non us and indeed non western value</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

525
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:22.020
<v Speaker 3>We need to have a wider range of</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies involved.</v>

526
00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:26.090
<v Speaker 3>So we need to have a telephone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to have other kinds of internet</v>

527
00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.820
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to have the next Google or the</v>

528
00:33:28.821 --> 00:33:32.590
<v Speaker 3>next company that the social network</v>
<v Speaker 3>would be another group or groups</v>

529
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:36.830
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think the criticism that we have</v>

530
00:33:36.831 --> 00:33:39.120
<v Speaker 3>not scaled,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

531
00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.080
<v Speaker 3>we are at scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Completely agree with that.</v>

532
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:44.740
<v Speaker 3>To say that we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that we haven't scaled this</v>

533
00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:46.190
<v Speaker 3>quickly needs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a failure.</v>

534
00:33:46.191 --> 00:33:48.290
<v Speaker 3>I would say that's an overstatement and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

535
00:33:48.291 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps if Andrew had been around or</v>

536
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:53.600
<v Speaker 3>that we would have more company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so maybe he'll help us get some other</v>

537
00:33:53.601 --> 00:33:58.601
<v Speaker 3>folks to sign on if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we asked him to go back to window and</v>

538
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:03.800
<v Speaker 3>I was just an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just an idea.</v>

539
00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Even if the had to deal with a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

540
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:10.450
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the process like a tear there</v>

541
00:34:10.490 --> 00:34:12.860
<v Speaker 3>to sell it internally to people at</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google?</v>

542
00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:14.620
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

543
00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:20.020
<v Speaker 3>what will be most conservatives couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>accomplish quality st death as yet</v>

544
00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.420
<v Speaker 3>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Treatment,</v>

545
00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.430
<v Speaker 3>what would it be concerned is what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>drawn out.</v>

546
00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:30.200
<v Speaker 4>Most of the concerns with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just to be too late and too useless</v>

547
00:34:30.201 --> 00:34:35.160
<v Speaker 4>and will be sort of like a pr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fig leaf for companies was worse</v>

548
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:38.320
<v Speaker 4>practices than ours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd say that's probably the primary</v>

549
00:34:38.930 --> 00:34:39.763
<v Speaker 4>thing that we had to.</v>

550
00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 3>What's your biggest weakness?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You work too hard.</v>

551
00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.940
<v Speaker 4>I just care too much.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

552
00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:50.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

553
00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

554
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:54.230
<v Speaker 4>the sales job that we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

555
00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.660
<v Speaker 4>that we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

556
00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sort of do one on the two guys who</v>

557
00:34:59.081 --> 00:35:02.170
<v Speaker 4>started the goal was to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

558
00:35:02.580 --> 00:35:04.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was to persuade them that this wasn't</v>

559
00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:09.690
<v Speaker 4>just sort of like putting people's</v>
<v Speaker 4>weight behind a PR exercise that was</v>

560
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:14.700
<v Speaker 4>more important to the other participants</v>
<v Speaker 4>that loves to us on the other concern</v>

561
00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:20.480
<v Speaker 4>which was student process was on as a</v>
<v Speaker 4>publicly traded company on the idea of</v>

562
00:35:22.180 --> 00:35:25.630
<v Speaker 4>having sort of outside auditors go</v>
<v Speaker 4>crawling through the company every</v>

563
00:35:25.631 --> 00:35:27.310
<v Speaker 4>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

564
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.970
<v Speaker 4>to judge our compliance with standards</v>
<v Speaker 4>is not one,</v>

565
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:36.910
<v Speaker 4>it's not one that the lawyers who deal</v>
<v Speaker 4>with no obligations will</v>

566
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.590
<v Speaker 4>tcs to get back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we had to cook up a compliance</v>

567
00:35:41.591 --> 00:35:43.660
<v Speaker 4>mechanism which would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

568
00:35:43.661 --> 00:35:48.661
<v Speaker 4>just recently trust building but not so</v>
<v Speaker 4>intrusive to trigger a bunch of alarms,</v>

569
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:56.060
<v Speaker 4>alarm bells in that cereal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>serial informational material,</v>

570
00:35:56.081 --> 00:36:00.260
<v Speaker 4>non public information coming out into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the public in a way,</v>

571
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:02.530
<v Speaker 4>that</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of thing.</v>

572
00:36:02.531 --> 00:36:04.800
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to do this training</v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

573
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I see some questions from the</v>

574
00:36:09.201 --> 00:36:10.250
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

575
00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:20.460
<v Speaker 1>so I've always been struck by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>observation that if you keep data in the</v>

576
00:36:20.901 --> 00:36:25.370
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can tie governance like the Chinese</v>

577
00:36:25.371 --> 00:36:29.810
<v Speaker 1>government in knots trying to get to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with letters rogatory and mutual</v>

578
00:36:29.811 --> 00:36:32.840
<v Speaker 1>assistance and enforcement trees and</v>
<v Speaker 1>such.</v>

579
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Because I always seemed to me that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some data that the US</v>

580
00:36:37.221 --> 00:36:40.040
<v Speaker 1>government had reason to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google health does it interest to the</v>

581
00:36:40.041 --> 00:36:43.390
<v Speaker 1>government here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Google's answer was it's in China,</v>

582
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:47.180
<v Speaker 1>don't talk to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the US government would say,</v>

583
00:36:47.181 --> 00:36:49.520
<v Speaker 1>well go talk to this contempt citation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

584
00:36:49.521 --> 00:36:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd just arrest the people who are on</v>

585
00:36:52.641 --> 00:36:54.560
<v Speaker 1>us term and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

586
00:36:54.561 --> 00:36:57.710
<v Speaker 1>we're going to keep you in jail until</v>
<v Speaker 1>you talked to the Chinese and get them</v>

587
00:36:57.711 --> 00:36:59.800
<v Speaker 1>to give you the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I always wondered,</v>

588
00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:03.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't the same true on the training side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things that they,</v>

589
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:06.700
<v Speaker 1>as long as you've got boots on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground engineer's there,</v>

590
00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:10.220
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese can pull your license.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Current restaurant engineer's insert all</v>

591
00:37:10.221 --> 00:37:13.730
<v Speaker 1>sorts of pressure for violating their</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic law.</v>

592
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:18.650
<v Speaker 1>If you failed to turn over information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how big a difference does it make</v>

593
00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.230
<v Speaker 1>that the data is physically on some</v>
<v Speaker 1>other server?</v>

594
00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.360
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really good question and either</v>

595
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:28.820
<v Speaker 4>that better example than China's sale</v>
<v Speaker 4>because actually the facility gets</v>

596
00:37:28.821 --> 00:37:32.690
<v Speaker 4>indicted the head of our Brazil</v>
<v Speaker 4>operation because we were not</v>

597
00:37:32.691 --> 00:37:34.420
<v Speaker 4>surrendering a user,</v>
<v Speaker 4>David,</v>

598
00:37:34.421 --> 00:37:38.870
<v Speaker 4>that was helpful on servers in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing difference between the US and</v>

599
00:37:38.871 --> 00:37:42.230
<v Speaker 4>every other country is that because</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're headquartered in the US,</v>

600
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.790
<v Speaker 4>it means that all of the subsidiaries</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside the United States are controlled</v>

601
00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.760
<v Speaker 4>by the US.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the,</v>

602
00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.720
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the converse is not true.</v>

603
00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:55.670
<v Speaker 4>The local subsidiaries elsewhere do not</v>
<v Speaker 4>control the operation in the United</v>

604
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:56.503
<v Speaker 4>States.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

605
00:37:56.610 --> 00:38:01.610
<v Speaker 4>but even so with what with resilience</v>
<v Speaker 4>did was they were interested in getting</v>

606
00:38:01.671 --> 00:38:05.900
<v Speaker 4>data about people that they claim they</v>
<v Speaker 4>felt child pornographers,</v>

607
00:38:05.901 --> 00:38:09.230
<v Speaker 4>so people that were trading bad images</v>
<v Speaker 4>in working.</v>

608
00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:14.470
<v Speaker 4>So I know that background.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Google runs as a sort of strange 20</v>

609
00:38:15.201 --> 00:38:19.090
<v Speaker 4>percent engineering time project and</v>
<v Speaker 4>social working,</v>

610
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.460
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which nobody in the United States a</v>

611
00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.840
<v Speaker 4>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but especially in Brazil in particular,</v>

612
00:38:25.841 --> 00:38:29.210
<v Speaker 4>to a degree that no service,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the United States where they're certain</v>

613
00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.350
<v Speaker 4>virtually everybody on the Internet as</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're good accounts and they use it to</v>

614
00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:34.184
<v Speaker 4>keep in touch with each.</v>

615
00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:38.130
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have some theories about why that was</v>

616
00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.800
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>

617
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.510
<v Speaker 4>Brazil actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Berkman center is at the heart</v>

618
00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.880
<v Speaker 4>monitor them because three of the people</v>
<v Speaker 4>who were kind of like ground zero users</v>

619
00:38:45.881 --> 00:38:48.490
<v Speaker 4>for the Internet in Brazil were up 49</v>
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>

620
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm a add to Berkman center and later</v>
<v Speaker 4>went back.</v>

621
00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:57.260
<v Speaker 4>This is our kaminsky ended up when all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of us and one other guy and they</v>

622
00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:01.590
<v Speaker 4>certainly became a part of the working</v>
<v Speaker 4>group anyways,</v>

623
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:03.590
<v Speaker 4>so hard work it takes off down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But anyways,</v>

624
00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:04.640
<v Speaker 4>so Jonathan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

625
00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.150
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

626
00:39:07.151 --> 00:39:10.690
<v Speaker 4>so the working community sort of really</v>
<v Speaker 4>takes off and becomes a big deal in</v>

627
00:39:10.691 --> 00:39:13.260
<v Speaker 4>Brazil and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

628
00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.330
<v Speaker 4>people were using it for everything that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you used the Internet for.</v>

629
00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're using it to share child</v>

630
00:39:18.161 --> 00:39:20.500
<v Speaker 4>porn images,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were using it to engage in racist</v>

631
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:23.090
<v Speaker 4>tribes that were using it to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

632
00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:23.951
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

633
00:39:23.951 --> 00:39:25.490
<v Speaker 4>do all the good things that you know</v>
<v Speaker 4>about,</v>

634
00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.970
<v Speaker 4>but they're also easy to do the bat.</v>

635
00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.240
<v Speaker 4>So Google's a posture has always been to</v>
<v Speaker 4>never engage others,</v>

636
00:39:31.290 --> 00:39:35.880
<v Speaker 4>sort of control over content,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but rather to be a platform and respond</v>

637
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 4>reactively when users flag things that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are against our terms are against the</v>

638
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:45.130
<v Speaker 4>law of this stuff will be out there and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would often be there,</v>

639
00:39:45.131 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for law enforcement officials to capture</v>

640
00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:50.280
<v Speaker 4>screenshots and then mom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>complainants.</v>

641
00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:51.610
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

642
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.290
<v Speaker 4>there were um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

643
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.080
<v Speaker 4>both things which were illegal in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>

644
00:39:56.081 --> 00:39:57.260
<v Speaker 4>like childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

645
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:59.350
<v Speaker 4>we just did the letter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

646
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.060
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking place to work and then there were</v>

647
00:40:01.061 --> 00:40:03.240
<v Speaker 4>also fixed that we're not going to be in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that state.</v>

648
00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:04.330
<v Speaker 4>So that would be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>

649
00:40:04.331 --> 00:40:05.710
<v Speaker 4>racism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

650
00:40:05.711 --> 00:40:08.350
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were no police trying to pursue,</v>

651
00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:10.840
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the greeters of racists,</v>

652
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:13.500
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>groups in Brazil and angry.</v>

653
00:40:13.501 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 4>We meet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we read an impasse,</v>

654
00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 4>impassable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We told him that they had to go use an a</v>

655
00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 4>and m black mechanism to get the data</v>
<v Speaker 4>cooperation with the United States.</v>

656
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:23.500
<v Speaker 4>They told us so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

657
00:40:23.590 --> 00:40:26.370
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna make,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're gonna arrest her people in jail</v>

658
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.110
<v Speaker 4>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And indeed they did indict ahead of</v>

659
00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:34.420
<v Speaker 4>personal obligation and extremely</v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable a situation for instance.</v>

660
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:40.040
<v Speaker 4>So we ended up doing was basically set</v>
<v Speaker 4>up a server inside Brazil and copies of</v>

661
00:40:43.361 --> 00:40:48.361
<v Speaker 4>child porn images and stuff worth onto</v>
<v Speaker 4>that server so that it's actually</v>

662
00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:54.600
<v Speaker 4>physically subject to jurisdiction and</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't be violating US law by channel</v>

663
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:59.190
<v Speaker 4>data</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of the bounds of legal process.</v>

664
00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:00.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

665
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 4>that's standard office suite works.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

666
00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:06.190
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and we also,</v>

667
00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if the problem is now</v>

668
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:14.890
<v Speaker 4>the problems that the United States law</v>
<v Speaker 4>speced specifies that that will be</v>

669
00:41:15.911 --> 00:41:18.660
<v Speaker 4>discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A child born in HR systems somewhere.</v>

670
00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:21.750
<v Speaker 4>He notified the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which gives you and that you're sharing</v>

671
00:41:21.751 --> 00:41:24.700
<v Speaker 4>that eventually a organization called</v>
<v Speaker 4>the National Center for missing</v>

672
00:41:24.701 --> 00:41:28.220
<v Speaker 4>exploited children,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a great organization to an</v>

673
00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:32.140
<v Speaker 4>executive and financially and they do</v>
<v Speaker 4>excellent sort of forensic work out on</v>

674
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:36.610
<v Speaker 4>the Internet to try to track people down</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it couldn't trust,</v>

675
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.490
<v Speaker 4>but they'll also is very.</v>

676
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.080
<v Speaker 4>That is the only organization that we</v>
<v Speaker 4>are legally allowed to treat.</v>

677
00:41:42.081 --> 00:41:44.570
<v Speaker 4>These images have overtaken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so,</v>

678
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:45.380
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

679
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.750
<v Speaker 4>we had to sort of go through a process</v>
<v Speaker 4>of getting a,</v>

680
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:52.810
<v Speaker 4>getting a kind of an okay for us to have</v>
<v Speaker 4>these images are shared.</v>

681
00:41:53.121 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 4>We the resilient law enforcement and</v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible.</v>

682
00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:59.510
<v Speaker 4>This is just a silly law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It just needs to be fixed because</v>

683
00:41:59.930 --> 00:42:04.930
<v Speaker 4>there's no point in saying that to us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These are forbidden from sharing a legal</v>

684
00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:08.180
<v Speaker 4>activity elsewhere if law enforcement</v>
<v Speaker 4>elsewhere.</v>

685
00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:09.560
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

686
00:42:09.561 --> 00:42:11.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a question that you asked is</v>

687
00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:14.920
<v Speaker 4>what's the socket just arresting and</v>
<v Speaker 4>invoice?</v>

688
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.110
<v Speaker 4>The answer's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

689
00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:16.680
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

690
00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.840
<v Speaker 4>they did do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is that,</v>

691
00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:22.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you start to look like a hostel and</v>

692
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:26.570
<v Speaker 4>unreasonable environment for investments</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for Internet companies to operate.</v>

693
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:30.620
<v Speaker 4>One advantage that we have is that even</v>
<v Speaker 4>police chiefs and government officials</v>

694
00:42:30.621 --> 00:42:32.590
<v Speaker 4>in districts and countries like and</v>
<v Speaker 4>using,</v>

695
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and find that it's useful so they,</v>

696
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.370
<v Speaker 4>they're often not particularly</v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in going the nuclear rooms</v>

697
00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:41.020
<v Speaker 4>and pulling her licenses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kicking us out of the country and</v>

698
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.200
<v Speaker 4>resting air holes.</v>

699
00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.350
<v Speaker 3>So let's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

700
00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:55.110
<v Speaker 3>let's change topics a little bit and so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

701
00:42:55.570 --> 00:43:00.570
<v Speaker 3>say when you mentioned the foundation</v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress last term was paying a bill</v>

702
00:43:02.161 --> 00:43:04.740
<v Speaker 3>called Blah Blah Blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was,</v>

703
00:43:05.250 --> 00:43:06.800
<v Speaker 3>that took a different coach than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

704
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:07.970
<v Speaker 3>than,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

705
00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.900
<v Speaker 3>than the Gi.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But for all,</v>

706
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.360
<v Speaker 3>for this question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just all you know is that you're not</v>

707
00:43:12.361 --> 00:43:15.600
<v Speaker 3>anymore and I will never been.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say so.</v>

708
00:43:15.601 --> 00:43:19.550
<v Speaker 3>Let's say the Congress instead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says you'll have some kind of APP.</v>

709
00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:23.280
<v Speaker 3>It says American companies doing</v>
<v Speaker 3>business abroad.</v>

710
00:43:23.690 --> 00:43:27.410
<v Speaker 3>He's accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He sent me to a sign up for it.</v>

711
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.020
<v Speaker 3>What happened is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that an APP?</v>

712
00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:35.040
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will be up to us to make it into</v>

713
00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.890
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think,</v>

714
00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as of right now,</v>

715
00:43:38.011 --> 00:43:41.840
<v Speaker 3>it would be a little difficult to go</v>
<v Speaker 3>from having three companies and a total</v>

716
00:43:41.841 --> 00:43:46.841
<v Speaker 3>of 20 participants</v>
<v Speaker 3>invest with the scale required level</v>

717
00:43:50.610 --> 00:43:55.320
<v Speaker 3>adjustment on one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upside down,</v>

718
00:43:55.321 --> 00:44:00.321
<v Speaker 3>some of our notions with respect to</v>
<v Speaker 3>governance and cool and underworlds</v>

719
00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:02.290
<v Speaker 3>firms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they agree to participate.</v>

720
00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:05.370
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's an adjustment that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>make in terms of the,</v>

721
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:06.480
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's,</v>

722
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.240
<v Speaker 3>that's more process oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think in terms of the,</v>

723
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:12.840
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the guidelines said the patient better</v>

724
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:16.240
<v Speaker 3>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would absolutely skill.</v>

725
00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:20.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is giving me maybe for all his</v>

726
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.310
<v Speaker 3>criticism</v>
<v Speaker 3>as to the rule of law,</v>

727
00:44:26.311 --> 00:44:29.060
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a significant part of the GNA and</v>

728
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:34.130
<v Speaker 3>to introduce process is where there has</v>
<v Speaker 3>been no process which has been a major</v>

729
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:37.740
<v Speaker 3>heading,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a profoundly negative impact on you.</v>

730
00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:40.590
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in many respects this would be a</v>

731
00:44:40.591 --> 00:44:41.281
<v Speaker 3>great game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

732
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:44.050
<v Speaker 3>To have everyone participating in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

733
00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 3>a snap of the other things you do is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that as we have a greater number of</v>

734
00:44:48.901 --> 00:44:52.470
<v Speaker 3>participants in more diverse markets</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the world,</v>

735
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:56.520
<v Speaker 3>it gives us the opportunity to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>greater transparency so that instead of</v>

736
00:44:56.521 --> 00:45:00.330
<v Speaker 3>just asking Google to release this block</v>
<v Speaker 3>list or it's sort of statistics which</v>

737
00:45:00.331 --> 00:45:04.130
<v Speaker 3>it's been,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may be elected to do for,</v>

738
00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:08.700
<v Speaker 3>it could in fact highlights behavior in</v>
<v Speaker 3>front of a certain document,</v>

739
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:14.150
<v Speaker 3>either compliance or lack of compliance</v>
<v Speaker 3>to aggregate collectively the statistics</v>

740
00:45:14.401 --> 00:45:15.820
<v Speaker 3>of the number of different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

741
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.530
<v Speaker 3>the number of different companies to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>the show to both policymakers,</v>

742
00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:21.300
<v Speaker 3>users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>activists,</v>

743
00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.440
<v Speaker 3>and others.</v>

744
00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.910
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's happening so,</v>

745
00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:28.710
<v Speaker 3>so move away from censorship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Censorship is a problem or a privacy,</v>

746
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.050
<v Speaker 3>your privacy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your private information.</v>

747
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 3>It's not really safe towards saying this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is how unsafe it is or this is how big a</v>

748
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:37.620
<v Speaker 3>problem with this is the trend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

749
00:45:37.621 --> 00:45:40.560
<v Speaker 3>we're seeing greater and greater amounts</v>
<v Speaker 3>of censorship or we're not really.</v>

750
00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew says it's actually other problem</v>

751
00:45:43.321 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 3>is that is finishing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that one of the,</v>

752
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.460
<v Speaker 3>one of the sort of medium term goals</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Gsi,</v>

753
00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:53.130
<v Speaker 3>which is the rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is to generate this kind of data so that</v>

754
00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:56.200
<v Speaker 3>we can actually have empirical</v>
<v Speaker 3>information about what's happening and</v>

755
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.880
<v Speaker 3>that then a citizens users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

756
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:04.520
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies and policy makers can make</v>

757
00:46:04.521 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 3>choices based on that information.</v>

758
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:11.470
<v Speaker 4>So make a note about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So as censorship is not diminishing or</v>

759
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:18.130
<v Speaker 4>why should,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we're experiencing right now,</v>

760
00:46:18.131 --> 00:46:22.450
<v Speaker 4>a massive surge all fly expansion in</v>
<v Speaker 4>censorship.</v>

761
00:46:23.170 --> 00:46:25.810
<v Speaker 4>It's not interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not happening in China.</v>

762
00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:31.500
<v Speaker 4>It's happening again in a vast swath of</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries in western Europe,</v>

763
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:34.960
<v Speaker 4>on Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Southeast Asia,</v>

764
00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:37.780
<v Speaker 4>South Asia and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you had.</v>

765
00:46:37.781 --> 00:46:42.781
<v Speaker 4>Your country is now attempting to impose</v>
<v Speaker 4>restrictions on the Internet in the name</v>

766
00:46:44.291 --> 00:46:47.440
<v Speaker 4>of copyright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the name of child protection,</v>

767
00:46:47.590 --> 00:46:52.590
<v Speaker 4>in any combat and indigo activity and in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the case of many telcos in the name of</v>

768
00:46:55.630 --> 00:47:00.370
<v Speaker 4>a differentiating services and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and in a fast and slow lanes for</v>

769
00:47:00.371 --> 00:47:01.890
<v Speaker 4>different kinds of content.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

770
00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:03.820
<v Speaker 4>so from,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from my perspective,</v>

771
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:05.000
<v Speaker 4>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a,</v>

772
00:47:05.230 --> 00:47:09.040
<v Speaker 4>a gathering storm seating.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

773
00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.530
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think for the US government,</v>

774
00:47:11.531 --> 00:47:13.720
<v Speaker 4>this is something that needs to be taken</v>
<v Speaker 4>very serious.</v>

775
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:18.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm leaving aside the exportability of</v>
<v Speaker 4>American values like freedom of</v>

776
00:47:20.531 --> 00:47:25.531
<v Speaker 4>expression in the old tradition of John</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mark and John Stuart Mill Constitution.</v>

777
00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:28.970
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have an economic interest in that</v>

778
00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:34.770
<v Speaker 4>information center which generates a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>of cash and jobs to be kind of embracing</v>

779
00:47:35.431 --> 00:47:39.590
<v Speaker 4>about it is this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the single biggest trade</v>

780
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.370
<v Speaker 4>barriers we faced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

781
00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.940
<v Speaker 4>so I actually think that the perspective</v>
<v Speaker 4>of either legislation or executive</v>

782
00:47:45.941 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 4>action for both,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a pretty wide.</v>

783
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:53.050
<v Speaker 4>So it's worth considering and see if the</v>
<v Speaker 4>United States can use.</v>

784
00:47:53.051 --> 00:47:57.350
<v Speaker 4>It's a whatever remains our economic</v>
<v Speaker 4>power worldwide.</v>

785
00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:02.800
<v Speaker 4>All in the service of freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 4>expression offer individuals worldwide</v>

786
00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:07.860
<v Speaker 4>cause it's in the interest of our movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>industry or a TV or newspaper industry's</v>

787
00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:12.550
<v Speaker 4>Internet companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so we've all got an interest in</v>

788
00:48:12.551 --> 00:48:16.190
<v Speaker 4>being able to move information without a</v>
<v Speaker 4>enduring.</v>

789
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:17.170
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

790
00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:19.410
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

791
00:48:19.570 --> 00:48:23.470
<v Speaker 4>many complex and expensive censorship</v>
<v Speaker 4>regime center are,</v>

792
00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.060
<v Speaker 4>many of them are very well intentioned</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're not going to traditional</v>

793
00:48:27.061 --> 00:48:28.000
<v Speaker 4>where,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

794
00:48:28.001 --> 00:48:30.140
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adults autonomy is not a,</v>

795
00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:34.180
<v Speaker 4>it's not the prevailing value rather</v>
<v Speaker 4>than freshman social values,</v>

796
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:35.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>

797
00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:39.910
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I actually just there another big fan</v>

798
00:48:39.911 --> 00:48:42.490
<v Speaker 4>of the name which would be this building</v>
<v Speaker 4>highlighted,</v>

799
00:48:42.491 --> 00:48:46.060
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on an basis barely make it illegal for</v>

800
00:48:46.061 --> 00:48:50.410
<v Speaker 4>us to deliver it in an email message to</v>
<v Speaker 4>China because of the way it's written.</v>

801
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.760
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

802
00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.320
<v Speaker 4>even leaving that aside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there probably are things to be</v>

803
00:48:54.330 --> 00:48:59.330
<v Speaker 4>get you to try to raise the bar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a little wall in center,</v>

804
00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:01.600
<v Speaker 4>our trading partners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

805
00:49:01.601 --> 00:49:04.300
<v Speaker 4>to create a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an environment in which our companies</v>

806
00:49:04.301 --> 00:49:06.520
<v Speaker 4>are edited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

807
00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:08.010
<v Speaker 4>regardless of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

808
00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of censorship restrictions</v>

809
00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.630
<v Speaker 5>against the background of that last</v>
<v Speaker 5>comment,</v>

810
00:49:18.631 --> 00:49:22.770
<v Speaker 5>which seems strong.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not at all clear to me why you</v>

811
00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:27.830
<v Speaker 5>think that reliance on the foundational</v>
<v Speaker 5>principle of the rule of law is going to</v>

812
00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.900
<v Speaker 5>help.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would seem just discussed the</v>

813
00:49:30.901 --> 00:49:35.901
<v Speaker 5>alternatives scenario for moment still</v>
<v Speaker 5>there because you just disappeared from</v>

814
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:37.450
<v Speaker 5>the screen now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There we are.</v>

815
00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm here.</v>

816
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.160
<v Speaker 4>I can hear you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

817
00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:44.580
<v Speaker 5>So the alternative scenarios,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one image you've combined the increased</v>

818
00:49:44.711 --> 00:49:47.830
<v Speaker 5>willingness of governments to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

819
00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:53.220
<v Speaker 5>to engage in overt forms of censorship</v>
<v Speaker 5>with the trend exemplified most recently</v>

820
00:49:54.341 --> 00:49:59.341
<v Speaker 5>by the Goldsmith book acknowledging the</v>
<v Speaker 5>technical feasibility of country</v>

821
00:50:01.601 --> 00:50:05.050
<v Speaker 5>specific management in such an</v>
<v Speaker 5>environment.</v>

822
00:50:05.051 --> 00:50:07.840
<v Speaker 5>It would seem that the rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

823
00:50:08.350 --> 00:50:13.350
<v Speaker 5>to the extended connotes open processes</v>
<v Speaker 5>of making an independent judiciaries is</v>

824
00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:19.240
<v Speaker 5>not going to do anything to retard the</v>
<v Speaker 5>imposition of controls on speech.</v>

825
00:50:19.290 --> 00:50:23.260
<v Speaker 5>It just have legislatures in Saudi</v>
<v Speaker 5>Arabia is saying actually we think</v>

826
00:50:23.261 --> 00:50:28.250
<v Speaker 5>sexualities and bad idea and the judges</v>
<v Speaker 5>appropriately commissioned to execute</v>

827
00:50:28.251 --> 00:50:31.510
<v Speaker 5>the law say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we think sexuality is a bad idea and</v>

828
00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:35.840
<v Speaker 5>we're going to clamp down on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So why is there any advantage to</v>

829
00:50:35.841 --> 00:50:40.841
<v Speaker 5>employing the mechanisms of the rule of</v>
<v Speaker 5>law to resist the coming storm?</v>

830
00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.053
<v Speaker 5>It</v>

831
00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:47.340
<v Speaker 4>so is in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a structural answer of rule of law and</v>

832
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:55.330
<v Speaker 4>accountability and transparency answers</v>
<v Speaker 4>you struck with Scott,</v>

833
00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 4>unaccountable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nontransparent,</v>

834
00:50:58.071 --> 00:51:03.071
<v Speaker 4>secretive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the structural answer that answered</v>

835
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:07.530
<v Speaker 4>substances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just social consensus.</v>

836
00:51:07.531 --> 00:51:11.730
<v Speaker 4>As a group censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means you still also have to add</v>

837
00:51:11.810 --> 00:51:16.810
<v Speaker 4>the substantive arguments and build a</v>
<v Speaker 4>substantive case why he should not</v>

838
00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:22.570
<v Speaker 4>attempt to the memory of Kemal Ataturk</v>
<v Speaker 4>or protect community shake you.</v>

839
00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.120
<v Speaker 4>I think that it's an answered you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

840
00:51:26.121 --> 00:51:27.720
<v Speaker 4>And so I can engage in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a,</v>

841
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:31.750
<v Speaker 4>in a series of arguments possibly to</v>
<v Speaker 4>economic and diplomatic.</v>

842
00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.240
<v Speaker 4>It's a to do subsequent.</v>

843
00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.890
<v Speaker 5>Can you vote for questions here?</v>

844
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:47.710
<v Speaker 6>So now you've got a little bit of</v>
<v Speaker 6>background on the issues in a democratic</v>

845
00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:54.050
<v Speaker 6>cross international borders and a that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to make you do it.</v>

846
00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.380
<v Speaker 6>So welcome everyone to the first</v>
<v Speaker 6>international conference on Democratic</v>

847
00:51:59.961 --> 00:52:03.480
<v Speaker 6>Free Speech Online.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is a build on facts because we ended</v>

848
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.940
<v Speaker 6>up last week that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

849
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.920
<v Speaker 6>there is a recent case in which a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>

850
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:17.330
<v Speaker 6>a Vietnamese missive to Internet service</v>
<v Speaker 6>within Vietnam telling them which sites</v>

851
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.810
<v Speaker 6>are blocked was given out to various</v>
<v Speaker 6>products.</v>

852
00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 6>We didn't have a staff member of one of</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Vietnamese Internet service</v>

853
00:52:29.841 --> 00:52:34.841
<v Speaker 6>providers blog about the list of blocked</v>
<v Speaker 6>sites on his,</v>

854
00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:39.260
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>his pro-democracy blog published by</v>

855
00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.630
<v Speaker 6>Yahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is the most popular blogging</v>

856
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:47.650
<v Speaker 6>service in Vietnam today.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was picked up by Rebecca Mackinnon</v>

857
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.700
<v Speaker 6>global voices,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a popular,</v>

858
00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:58.310
<v Speaker 6>a Franchisor of individual for an</v>
<v Speaker 6>auction,</v>

859
00:52:58.370 --> 00:53:03.020
<v Speaker 6>bloggers around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that wasn't picked up by the New</v>

860
00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:06.620
<v Speaker 6>York Times,</v>
<v Speaker 6>New York Times story upset that the</v>

861
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:07.463
<v Speaker 6>enemy is government.</v>

862
00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:12.870
<v Speaker 6>Government in turn has come together to</v>
<v Speaker 6>ask them to give up the names of the</v>

863
00:53:13.361 --> 00:53:15.050
<v Speaker 6>people who were blogging this</v>
<v Speaker 6>information.</v>

864
00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:16.920
<v Speaker 6>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

865
00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:22.160
<v Speaker 6>it turns out this is the backdrop for a</v>
<v Speaker 6>group of international actors getting</v>

866
00:53:22.611 --> 00:53:24.710
<v Speaker 6>together and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we see this problem far too often.</v>

867
00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:29.910
<v Speaker 6>We'd really like to come up with a</v>
<v Speaker 6>solution that's going to allow all of us</v>

868
00:53:30.031 --> 00:53:35.031
<v Speaker 6>to be satisfied with procedures that we</v>
<v Speaker 6>have for dealing with these problems.</v>

869
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:40.260
<v Speaker 6>So we are going that each of you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your six groups,</v>

870
00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:42.000
<v Speaker 6>and I should name the six groups right</v>
<v Speaker 6>now,</v>

871
00:53:42.450 --> 00:53:46.080
<v Speaker 6>the government of Vietnam here,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have a group of Vietnamese Burnham</v>

872
00:53:46.090 --> 00:53:47.840
<v Speaker 6>auction bloggers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can just assume we're all wearing</v>

873
00:53:47.841 --> 00:53:49.550
<v Speaker 6>masks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the government of Vietnam doesn't</v>

874
00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:52.670
<v Speaker 6>spot on and take them home right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

875
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.280
<v Speaker 6>the United States Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a reputable August dissertation,</v>

876
00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:59.610
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the Board of</v>

877
00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:08.160
<v Speaker 6>international and convincing just</v>
<v Speaker 6>because they like look up the shoulders</v>

878
00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:10.360
<v Speaker 6>with their friends again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>China.</v>

879
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.320
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

880
00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:16.110
<v Speaker 6>right now what we'd like you to get to</v>
<v Speaker 6>do is take five minutes,</v>

881
00:54:16.710 --> 00:54:21.710
<v Speaker 6>discuss what it is that you'd like to</v>
<v Speaker 6>see as your actor in and sort of an</v>

882
00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:27.090
<v Speaker 6>international system for dealing with</v>
<v Speaker 6>these kinds of problems as they arise.</v>

883
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:30.930
<v Speaker 6>Each group should elect someone to act</v>
<v Speaker 6>as a communications director.</v>

884
00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.670
<v Speaker 6>That person should,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a laptop,</v>

885
00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:38.060
<v Speaker 6>then we're going to engage in two rounds</v>
<v Speaker 6>of sending people to other people's</v>

886
00:54:38.431 --> 00:54:40.320
<v Speaker 6>vacation is director or from various</v>
<v Speaker 6>parties,</v>

887
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:44.850
<v Speaker 6>negotiate over the agreement that every</v>
<v Speaker 6>part of the commitment.</v>

888
00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:47.600
<v Speaker 6>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we would take amnesty,</v>

889
00:54:47.860 --> 00:54:49.760
<v Speaker 6>Amnesty were to relax,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

890
00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:54.800
<v Speaker 6>room to be director,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then we send them over to various</v>

891
00:54:55.201 --> 00:54:59.030
<v Speaker 6>other groups can negotiate with them</v>
<v Speaker 6>over terms and everyone can agree with</v>

892
00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.490
<v Speaker 6>to come back to their communications</v>
<v Speaker 6>director and to write it into the final</v>

893
00:55:02.491 --> 00:55:06.630
<v Speaker 6>document that Amnesty International,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

894
00:55:07.630 --> 00:55:10.350
<v Speaker 6>we're going to have a second round of</v>
<v Speaker 6>meetings within the group.</v>

895
00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:11.850
<v Speaker 6>You can discuss what you heard from</v>
<v Speaker 6>anyone else.</v>

896
00:55:11.851 --> 00:55:15.120
<v Speaker 6>And a second round of negotiations and</v>
<v Speaker 6>then each group is going to present it</v>

897
00:55:15.121 --> 00:55:20.121
<v Speaker 6>solution and explained to us first why</v>
<v Speaker 6>it thinks it's a good solution for it's</v>

898
00:55:20.710 --> 00:55:24.450
<v Speaker 6>so valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why Amnesty International in particular</v>

899
00:55:24.451 --> 00:55:27.420
<v Speaker 6>sport the EMC solution,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then liked good solutions of the gen</v>

900
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:29.940
<v Speaker 6>and it's sort of a desirable overall</v>
<v Speaker 6>answer.</v>

901
00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:33.900
<v Speaker 6>So with that in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to give you five minutes</v>

902
00:55:33.901 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 6>starting now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She can sit with your groups,</v>

903
00:55:36.030 --> 00:55:39.550
<v Speaker 6>discuss exactly what you're negotiating</v>
<v Speaker 6>strategy conveyed and I'll let him know.</v>

904
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:05.630
<v Speaker 7>So the idea here is that not only that</v>
<v Speaker 7>but also to win the vote.</v>

905
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:12.860
<v Speaker 6>Which solution is the best solution.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So when you got here negotiating for</v>

906
00:56:13.841 --> 00:56:15.460
<v Speaker 6>your needs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're also negotiating.</v>

907
00:56:19.860 --> 00:56:22.650
<v Speaker 6>Our first presentation is going to be,</v>

908
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:29.230
<v Speaker 7>you</v>
<v Speaker 7>guys want to spend two minutes,</v>

909
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:31.730
<v Speaker 7>why you for you?</v>

910
00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.930
<v Speaker 8>Apparently I'm not so much into free</v>
<v Speaker 8>speech,</v>

911
00:56:44.570 --> 00:56:49.570
<v Speaker 8>which is probably a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but we're essentially DMTA style.</v>

912
00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:54.800
<v Speaker 8>Notice the take down because we</v>
<v Speaker 8>recognize that</v>

913
00:56:56.960 --> 00:57:00.750
<v Speaker 8>the Vietnamese government is never going</v>
<v Speaker 8>to allow us to just post whatever we</v>

914
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:05.540
<v Speaker 8>want online.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So it exchange for this Cape Town.</v>

915
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:10.750
<v Speaker 8>We were asking for the right to remain</v>
<v Speaker 8>anonymous and that will also get</v>

916
00:57:13.520 --> 00:57:18.410
<v Speaker 8>immunity from criminal penalties.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so why we thought this matter</v>

917
00:57:18.411 --> 00:57:21.500
<v Speaker 8>interest are interesting word that one</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have to post.</v>

918
00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.590
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and we also though,</v>

919
00:57:24.591 --> 00:57:28.310
<v Speaker 8>we don't want to make Vietnam too bad</v>
<v Speaker 8>because we want economic growth.</v>

920
00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:31.290
<v Speaker 8>So that's what I mean.</v>

921
00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:46.090
<v Speaker 7>The second group that we got was a Yahoo</v>
<v Speaker 7>International.</v>

922
00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:52.610
<v Speaker 7>We'd like to present yet</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yahoo,</v>

923
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:04.900
<v Speaker 7>the greatest collaboration with the</v>
<v Speaker 7>Vietnamese and the Chinese government</v>

924
00:58:07.060 --> 00:58:10.950
<v Speaker 7>game,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the following solution,</v>

925
00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.510
<v Speaker 7>finding arbitration underneath the</v>
<v Speaker 7>existing,</v>

926
00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:23.540
<v Speaker 7>the World Trade Organization Rishi,</v>
<v Speaker 7>such that if the government has a</v>

927
00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:28.740
<v Speaker 7>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if the Vietnamese bloggers have a</v>

928
00:58:28.741 --> 00:58:32.210
<v Speaker 7>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they can bring it to the attention of</v>

929
00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.240
<v Speaker 7>his international body.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The governments will have signed onto</v>

930
00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:42.320
<v Speaker 7>the GSI and principle and we can have a</v>
<v Speaker 7>binding arbitration's that uses the</v>

931
00:58:43.921 --> 00:58:48.921
<v Speaker 7>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>carrot and stick of the WTO arbitration</v>

932
00:58:50.250 --> 00:58:55.250
<v Speaker 7>per blog post.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Important general class action</v>

933
00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:56.370
<v Speaker 7>arbitration.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The</v>

934
00:58:56.370 --> 00:59:00.300
<v Speaker 1>details are that each country wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have their own boss.</v>

935
00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:04.840
<v Speaker 1>That basically kind of caught up by</v>
<v Speaker 1>their interpretation of Gina.</v>

936
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:09.520
<v Speaker 1>Both Vietnam and China agreed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle to kind of aspire towards Dni</v>

937
00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.510
<v Speaker 1>principles in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in respecting privacy,</v>

938
00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:16.260
<v Speaker 1>so in each individual case there will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes and procedures and laws and</v>

939
00:59:16.261 --> 00:59:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese in China and Vietnam which</v>
<v Speaker 1>be independent and respect their</v>

940
00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:25.580
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty now in extreme cases to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent that either party it the</v>

941
00:59:25.641 --> 00:59:30.641
<v Speaker 1>government or the blogger has a a major</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of dispute.</v>

942
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:35.700
<v Speaker 1>There would then be in a process by</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the either party could appeal</v>

943
00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:40.700
<v Speaker 1>these extreme cases to the WTO in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitration would inviting under the WTO</v>

944
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:45.730
<v Speaker 1>of which both is there a two inch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both Vietnam and China already kind of</v>

945
00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.320
<v Speaker 1>our members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exchange of information.</v>

946
00:59:51.321 --> 00:59:56.321
<v Speaker 1>Really a trade issue here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's that.</v>

947
00:59:59.110 --> 01:00:03.440
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that not that not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only respects the sovereignty of</v>

948
01:00:03.441 --> 01:00:06.740
<v Speaker 1>both of China and Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we think are paramount,</v>

949
01:00:06.741 --> 01:00:09.710
<v Speaker 1>but it also kind of creates an</v>
<v Speaker 1>international,</v>

950
01:00:09.850 --> 01:00:12.650
<v Speaker 1>a set of principles that other countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>can aspire to,</v>

951
01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what the Gi represents.</v>

952
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully this will keep other countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of start using guidelines,</v>

953
01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:22.930
<v Speaker 1>guiding principles in addition to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it kind of respects the</v>

954
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>privacy of the bloggers and the interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of groups like Amnesty International and</v>

955
01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly I think we think expands the</v>

956
01:00:35.211 --> 01:00:40.211
<v Speaker 1>global economic high</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine zero seven transactions.</v>

957
01:00:41.001 --> 01:00:42.170
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're</v>

958
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>with launch with the WTO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for being a disciplined and being</v>

959
01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>arrested for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for having his information turnovers</v>

960
01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>in future cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would be a procedure in place for</v>

961
01:01:05.391 --> 01:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>dealing with situations like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You try to because that's extremely.</v>

962
01:01:08.050 --> 01:01:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

963
01:01:09.910 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next up,</v>

964
01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese have a presentation or</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposal.</v>

965
01:01:18.010 --> 01:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I actually agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was pretty sort of the WTO.</v>

966
01:01:24.790 --> 01:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't really.</v>

967
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Our main proposal is that we think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries should agree to adopt the</v>

968
01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>United Nations on Peachtree Hispanic</v>
<v Speaker 1>program being dropped to about</v>

969
01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 70.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

970
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our position is that we're not</v>

971
01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:43.100
<v Speaker 1>going to have a sign on the agreement</v>
<v Speaker 1>here no matter what.</v>

972
01:01:51.250 --> 01:01:55.260
<v Speaker 1>Basically has it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

973
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an interstate matters from the wheel</v>

974
01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.430
<v Speaker 1>bolts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's commitments to letting countries do</v>

975
01:02:01.431 --> 01:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>what they want within their own borders</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not having other countries dictate</v>

976
01:02:05.301 --> 01:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>to 100 dictate to another country what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be doing.</v>

977
01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:14.560
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there anything here,</v>

978
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>but we won't sign on to anything</v>

979
01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.570
<v Speaker 6>that we don't with that is imposing on</v>
<v Speaker 6>our,</v>

980
01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:24.120
<v Speaker 6>our society,</v>
<v Speaker 6>someone else's.</v>

981
01:02:25.790 --> 01:02:30.790
<v Speaker 6>So now no international arbitration is</v>
<v Speaker 6>going to satisfy if it's not binding,</v>

982
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.150
<v Speaker 6>said Cheryl,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we might sign onto that.</v>

983
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:39.090
<v Speaker 6>Fair enough or it could be like the US</v>
<v Speaker 6>and even if it is binding and we started</v>

984
01:02:39.091 --> 01:02:40.740
<v Speaker 6>going through and just ignore what it</v>
<v Speaker 6>says</v>

985
01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:48.100
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that sounds reasonable.</v>

986
01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:53.010
<v Speaker 6>The United Nations a q,</v>
<v Speaker 6>six,</v>

987
01:02:53.011 --> 01:02:54.720
<v Speaker 6>17 group life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

988
01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:59.660
<v Speaker 6>That's</v>
<v Speaker 6>alright.</v>

989
01:03:00.270 --> 01:03:03.620
<v Speaker 6>Next up we'd like to hear from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>United States Congress.</v>

990
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:07.890
<v Speaker 6>So we realized that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

991
01:03:08.730 --> 01:03:11.850
<v Speaker 6>there are a lot of definitions of state</v>
<v Speaker 6>sovereignty play here,</v>

992
01:03:12.090 --> 01:03:14.460
<v Speaker 6>which is why,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

993
01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:16.700
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

994
01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.430
<v Speaker 6>we set up some sort of ex ante</v>
<v Speaker 6>procedure,</v>

995
01:03:20.620 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in order to determine what sorts of</v>

996
01:03:25.141 --> 01:03:30.000
<v Speaker 6>information requests are really</v>
<v Speaker 6>justified by telling me which ones</v>

997
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:31.050
<v Speaker 6>aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

998
01:03:31.051 --> 01:03:34.930
<v Speaker 6>so we propose a recording either a</v>
<v Speaker 6>committee or,</v>

999
01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.020
<v Speaker 6>or,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1000
01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:40.770
<v Speaker 6>an official within the US State</v>
<v Speaker 6>Department who would review requests,</v>

1001
01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.130
<v Speaker 6>formal</v>

1002
01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 6>requests,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1003
01:03:42.780 --> 01:03:44.610
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1004
01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.850
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the relevant government,</v>

1005
01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:49.340
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1006
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:54.480
<v Speaker 6>to determine whether there exists a</v>
<v Speaker 6>compelling need for information such as</v>

1007
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:56.130
<v Speaker 6>a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1008
01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.180
<v Speaker 6>a realistic connection to some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 6>terrorist activity.</v>

1009
01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.850
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and if such a need exists to then</v>

1010
01:04:05.910 --> 01:04:10.910
<v Speaker 6>authorize the ISP,</v>
<v Speaker 6>our ISP is in question to a handover,</v>

1011
01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.510
<v Speaker 6>the relevant information to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1012
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.630
<v Speaker 6>the request and government,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

1013
01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:20.430
<v Speaker 6>the ISP is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>would not be subject to penalties,</v>

1014
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:25.730
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>in this country unless they hand over</v>

1015
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:31.140
<v Speaker 6>information that has not already been</v>
<v Speaker 6>authorized by the government.</v>

1016
01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:34.480
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the US or the US government.</v>

1017
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.780
<v Speaker 6>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all negotiation,</v>

1018
01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:38.730
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all interaction interactions take place</v>

1019
01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:43.650
<v Speaker 6>on a state to state level,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but all the information that would go,</v>

1020
01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:46.500
<v Speaker 6>all the permission,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll go through this committee.</v>

1021
01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:50.060
<v Speaker 6>So any information that was turned over</v>
<v Speaker 6>to governments that didn't go through</v>

1022
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.830
<v Speaker 6>this committee would not be authorized</v>
<v Speaker 6>by Congress</v>

1023
01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:55.890
<v Speaker 6>government.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Uh,</v>

1024
01:04:56.790 --> 01:05:01.790
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the symmetric interpretation now</v>

1025
01:05:11.350 --> 01:05:16.350
<v Speaker 6>he had put in our original legislation</v>
<v Speaker 6>that we got some feedback,</v>

1026
01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:20.650
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>many of these companies in a very</v>

1027
01:05:20.651 --> 01:05:24.190
<v Speaker 8>difficult position where they would</v>
<v Speaker 8>either be forced to define local laws</v>

1028
01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:29.270
<v Speaker 8>are approved by our laws and we thought</v>
<v Speaker 8>it would be in the interest of bloggers</v>

1029
01:05:29.471 --> 01:05:33.700
<v Speaker 8>and democratic decisions around the</v>
<v Speaker 8>world to have the tool of the internet</v>

1030
01:05:33.701 --> 01:05:37.930
<v Speaker 8>at their disposal instead having yahoo</v>
<v Speaker 8>just leave the country for fear of</v>

1031
01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:43.500
<v Speaker 8>reprisal from whatever dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So we've got that by keeping this in the</v>

1032
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:48.450
<v Speaker 8>diplomatic sphere and by not trying to</v>
<v Speaker 8>harness the economic incentives that</v>

1033
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:52.210
<v Speaker 8>Isp,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we would actually be doing a greater</v>

1034
01:05:52.211 --> 01:05:54.580
<v Speaker 8>service to people who wanted to use the</v>
<v Speaker 8>internet.</v>

1035
01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:04.970
<v Speaker 3>The American government wanted to get</v>
<v Speaker 3>information that will poses overseas</v>

1036
01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:11.450
<v Speaker 3>against the wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say they're with us,</v>

1037
01:06:11.690 --> 01:06:16.430
<v Speaker 3>recede on applying pressure of the sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>that Andrew was talking about.</v>

1038
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:21.010
<v Speaker 3>Contempt of court for those assets are</v>
<v Speaker 3>people we can get our hands on.</v>

1039
01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:24.350
<v Speaker 3>They have a process like this place</v>

1040
01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:37.790
<v Speaker 7>that's classified</v>
<v Speaker 7>the US Congress now Amnesty</v>

1041
01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:47.120
<v Speaker 7>International.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So</v>

1042
01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:51.050
<v Speaker 3>our proposal is based on this principle</v>
<v Speaker 3>that when it gets into trouble,</v>

1043
01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:54.320
<v Speaker 3>a large number of parties who support</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rights,</v>

1044
01:06:54.530 --> 01:06:59.270
<v Speaker 3>including a state and non state actors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should have taken interest in exercising</v>

1045
01:06:59.271 --> 01:07:02.210
<v Speaker 3>all our necessary to defend that</v>
<v Speaker 3>blogger.</v>

1046
01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:06.890
<v Speaker 3>So that starts with us setting up a</v>
<v Speaker 3>network of pro bono lawyers in every</v>

1047
01:07:06.891 --> 01:07:11.891
<v Speaker 3>country who works specifically with</v>
<v Speaker 3>local laws concerning speech and also</v>

1048
01:07:13.281 --> 01:07:18.200
<v Speaker 3>lobbying governments to strengthen some</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of private right of action,</v>

1049
01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:21.740
<v Speaker 3>which is worthless when you're a blogger</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's secretly arrested,</v>

1050
01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.620
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but does do a little something towards</v>

1051
01:07:24.621 --> 01:07:29.080
<v Speaker 3>establishing international norms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We visualize the process is working on</v>

1052
01:07:29.081 --> 01:07:34.081
<v Speaker 3>those Vietnam complaints and Yahoo</v>
<v Speaker 3>alerts the blogger and get the water a</v>

1053
01:07:34.581 --> 01:07:37.850
<v Speaker 3>chance to correct false information or</v>
<v Speaker 3>pull the post.</v>

1054
01:07:38.090 --> 01:07:42.800
<v Speaker 3>And I think we saw some agreements on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of pulling the post and Yahoo</v>

1055
01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:47.300
<v Speaker 3>alert sauce and we activate our network</v>
<v Speaker 3>of pro bono lawyers so that this</v>

1056
01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:50.690
<v Speaker 3>anonymous blogger has some legal</v>
<v Speaker 3>representation in their home state.</v>

1057
01:07:51.130 --> 01:07:52.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then we'd have a review board</v>

1058
01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:57.800
<v Speaker 3>possibly based in the WTO that might</v>
<v Speaker 3>include a mechanism for anonymous</v>

1059
01:07:57.801 --> 01:08:00.920
<v Speaker 3>mediation between the Vietnamese</v>
<v Speaker 3>government and the blogger who's in</v>

1060
01:08:00.921 --> 01:08:02.990
<v Speaker 3>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although we know that there's a risk of</v>

1061
01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:07.700
<v Speaker 3>espionage here in anonymous mediation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1062
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:12.730
<v Speaker 3>the board could later can include the</v>
<v Speaker 3>TNI countries and maybe if,</v>

1063
01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:17.030
<v Speaker 3>if things are really not going include</v>
<v Speaker 3>other interests in nations,</v>

1064
01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:18.950
<v Speaker 3>hopefully United States.</v>

1065
01:08:21.090 --> 01:08:25.310
<v Speaker 3>So the idea is that we can really just</v>
<v Speaker 3>make this issue explode on the</v>

1066
01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 3>international level,</v>
<v Speaker 3>make an international incident out of</v>

1067
01:08:28.581 --> 01:08:31.300
<v Speaker 3>one nation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attempts to get to a single blogger.</v>

1068
01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.010
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd also like to see an extension to</v>

1069
01:08:34.011 --> 01:08:38.630
<v Speaker 3>the GSI that would mandate that all</v>
<v Speaker 3>these companies participating in</v>

1070
01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:43.040
<v Speaker 3>protecting speech rights online could</v>
<v Speaker 3>work together and collectively bargain</v>

1071
01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:44.690
<v Speaker 3>with say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Vietnamese government.</v>

1072
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:48.410
<v Speaker 3>So the nuclear option would look a</v>
<v Speaker 3>little something like this.</v>

1073
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Vietnam says turnover.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yahoo,</v>

1074
01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:55.100
<v Speaker 3>who says no negotiations totally fail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are going very badly.</v>

1075
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:58.160
<v Speaker 3>Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google and Yahoo unilaterally pull all</v>

1076
01:08:58.161 --> 01:09:01.670
<v Speaker 3>surfaces out of Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't awful for Vietnam in terms</v>

1077
01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:03.350
<v Speaker 3>of being competitive in a global market.</v>

1078
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what a</v>

1079
01:09:10.230 --> 01:09:14.770
<v Speaker 1>lot of state right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

1080
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then our final group is Vietnam.</v>

1081
01:09:23.350 --> 01:09:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll start.</v>

1082
01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:26.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1083
01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:31.450
<v Speaker 1>we talked to a good number of parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we feel very strongly that</v>

1084
01:09:31.620 --> 01:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>yahoo was obliged to turnover a blogger</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the,</v>

1085
01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:40.140
<v Speaker 1>a state secret with a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not believe that we move into post</v>

1086
01:09:40.570 --> 01:09:43.060
<v Speaker 1>remedies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem that we do with the blogger,</v>

1087
01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:44.750
<v Speaker 1>no more than we gave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julia said,</v>

1088
01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:46.240
<v Speaker 1>Ethel Rosenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oopsies.</v>

1089
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:48.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm making that up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a</v>

1090
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.903
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1091
01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:56.930
<v Speaker 1>no more than anyone would have done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a very serious matter.</v>

1092
01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:02.380
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that requires that</v>

1093
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:06.090
<v Speaker 1>judicial system of Vietnam going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that we believe that we offered</v>

1094
01:10:06.091 --> 01:10:09.450
<v Speaker 1>you processed by our laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have all of the procedures,</v>

1095
01:10:09.451 --> 01:10:14.451
<v Speaker 1>that we are willing to comply with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best practices of the GSI and for future</v>

1096
01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>forward looking proposals including</v>
<v Speaker 1>modifying the underlying infrastructure</v>

1097
01:10:19.801 --> 01:10:24.030
<v Speaker 1>of the internet or have proven to WTO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were willing to take these proposals</v>

1098
01:10:24.031 --> 01:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just joined the WTO two years ago</v>

1099
01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:30.660
<v Speaker 1>that we are country with very low</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet presence.</v>

1100
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And so we are not willing at this time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to commit ourselves to a abrogating any</v>

1101
01:10:34.981 --> 01:10:36.660
<v Speaker 1>jurisdiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1102
01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>and we are in fact willing to tell the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other if it's unwilling to follow the</v>

1103
01:10:39.810 --> 01:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>laws no differently than if they decided</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to follow the minimum wage laws.</v>

1104
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:46.970
<v Speaker 1>We are comfortable proceeding against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company for violating our last,</v>

1105
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we,</v>

1106
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:52.590
<v Speaker 1>we believe that there was some agreement</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so long as the country follows the</v>

1107
01:10:52.591 --> 01:10:57.591
<v Speaker 1>piece of law certainly does that she and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have principals are respected and that</v>

1108
01:10:59.491 --> 01:11:01.160
<v Speaker 1>this is something that I think a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties agree to.</v>

1109
01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of feedback on.</v>

1110
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:16.320
<v Speaker 3>Some of the ideas we've gone here and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then we're going to take a boat.</v>

1111
01:11:16.730 --> 01:11:18.060
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

1112
01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:20.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first the DVCA style notes and take</v>

1113
01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I thought,</v>

1114
01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:24.670
<v Speaker 3>let me just start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1115
01:11:24.670 --> 01:11:29.190
<v Speaker 3>go and think those are very creative</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas and I will certainly take them</v>

1116
01:11:29.191 --> 01:11:30.370
<v Speaker 3>back towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I</v>

1117
01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.700
<v Speaker 3>know</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to take a little while to</v>

1118
01:11:38.701 --> 01:11:43.701
<v Speaker 3>process that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The DNC was definitely interesting.</v>

1119
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.870
<v Speaker 3>I liked how you kinda came up with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tradeoffs.</v>

1120
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.590
<v Speaker 3>You just sort of that benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure that the Vietnamese</v>

1121
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:54.210
<v Speaker 3>government is necessarily going to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>really thrilled with that and it's.</v>

1122
01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:56.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I certainly love the idea of preserving</v>

1123
01:11:56.191 --> 01:11:57.660
<v Speaker 3>anonymity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but from what we've heard about the</v>

1124
01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they may not necessarily.</v>

1125
01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:02.940
<v Speaker 3>They may have other ways of knowing who</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are,</v>

1126
01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:06.270
<v Speaker 3>so I'm not sure that you're really going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to preserve your referring to key</v>

1127
01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:10.600
<v Speaker 3>loggers and other trojans and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>precise.</v>

1128
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:19.470
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to remember what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vietnamese isp situations,</v>

1129
01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:22.580
<v Speaker 3>but my recollection is that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a pretty close tie to the</v>

1130
01:12:22.581 --> 01:12:27.060
<v Speaker 3>government in a lot of instances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure how they're gonna feel</v>

1131
01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:30.720
<v Speaker 3>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but certainly it seems like a good start</v>

1132
01:12:30.721 --> 01:12:32.790
<v Speaker 3>to see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well if there is a problem and someone</v>

1133
01:12:32.791 --> 01:12:33.571
<v Speaker 3>does say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

1134
01:12:33.571 --> 01:12:36.290
<v Speaker 3>I want to blow the whistle on this does</v>
<v Speaker 3>scale unlike some of these other</v>

1135
01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:38.940
<v Speaker 3>solutions which I think are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have a real challenge with scaling.</v>

1136
01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:41.150
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether there's potential for abuse in</v>

1137
01:12:41.151 --> 01:12:44.460
<v Speaker 3>the DSCA style thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And certainly people have argued that</v>

1138
01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:48.670
<v Speaker 3>there have been abuses in the US of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on that front end therapy.</v>

1139
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Similarly in these context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what about international arbitration?</v>

1140
01:12:54.221 --> 01:12:58.680
<v Speaker 3>When Debbie came back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were some up.</v>

1141
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:01.140
<v Speaker 3>The trade issue is interesting and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is certainly something that the</v>

1142
01:13:01.141 --> 01:13:05.520
<v Speaker 3>companies have pursued.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know that anyone has really felt</v>

1143
01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 3>that adding it into WTO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe tim mover and paper that was</v>

1144
01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:13.920
<v Speaker 3>advocated for epic adding into WTO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my suspicion is the scaling issue is</v>

1145
01:13:15.421 --> 01:13:15.930
<v Speaker 3>one problem.</v>

1146
01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:19.770
<v Speaker 3>How does it work?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does it work in practice when you</v>

1147
01:13:19.771 --> 01:13:24.120
<v Speaker 3>have a pretty substantial number of</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual replaces a possible,</v>

1148
01:13:24.210 --> 01:13:25.710
<v Speaker 3>when you have a legitimate law</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement,</v>

1149
01:13:25.711 --> 01:13:28.080
<v Speaker 3>how do you determine the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>between those two things?</v>

1150
01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.270
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you guys also had government</v>

1151
01:13:30.271 --> 01:13:32.550
<v Speaker 3>signing on the GSI.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no clue without looking in</v>

1152
01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.670
<v Speaker 3>practice if a lot of it's about</v>
<v Speaker 3>responsible company behavior piece of</v>

1153
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 3>it's interactions with governments</v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than responsible government</v>

1154
01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.070
<v Speaker 3>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which it shouldn't be falling in some of</v>

1155
01:13:42.071 --> 01:13:45.120
<v Speaker 3>the US anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that somebody or perhaps that universal</v>

1156
01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:46.710
<v Speaker 3>declaration,</v>
<v Speaker 3>declaration of human rights to.</v>

1157
01:13:46.711 --> 01:13:50.730
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I assume that I have to be quite frank.</v>

1158
01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1159
01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:59.040
<v Speaker 3>I think the value of women within Dni,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is a venue for complaint.</v>

1160
01:13:59.041 --> 01:14:03.870
<v Speaker 3>There is a third party complaint</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism that we're working on right</v>

1161
01:14:03.871 --> 01:14:08.790
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I had a that needs to be some space,</v>

1162
01:14:08.791 --> 01:14:12.970
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not convinced that the WTO,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which hasn't arguably been super kind to</v>

1163
01:14:12.971 --> 01:14:14.690
<v Speaker 3>some countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't really do the best place.</v>

1164
01:14:18.650 --> 01:14:21.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1165
01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:29.650
<v Speaker 3>is that Chinese book before the</v>
<v Speaker 3>International Telecommunications Union</v>

1166
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:32.770
<v Speaker 3>to retrofit the Internet so that all</v>
<v Speaker 3>communications are traceable.</v>

1167
01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:38.710
<v Speaker 3>It's proceeding for studying from now</v>
<v Speaker 3>until 2012 for the Chinese herbalist.</v>

1168
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:43.130
<v Speaker 3>Very hard and ACB and finger in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>class as well.</v>

1169
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.860
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I guess to the rest of new attorneys</v>

1170
01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.640
<v Speaker 3>may have this already involved in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think what you would see as sort</v>

1171
01:14:51.641 --> 01:14:54.550
<v Speaker 3>of always seen with a lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 3>technologies that there would be scope</v>

1172
01:14:54.551 --> 01:14:56.860
<v Speaker 3>creep and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you might,</v>

1173
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.390
<v Speaker 3>when you start out with your filtering</v>
<v Speaker 3>or sensory activity,</v>

1174
01:14:59.391 --> 01:15:03.760
<v Speaker 3>you begin to filter out or filter or</v>
<v Speaker 3>search for child porn only.</v>

1175
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 3>And then child porn moves into kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>other objectional speech.</v>

1176
01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:07.661
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

1177
01:15:07.661 --> 01:15:10.550
<v Speaker 3>the political opposition or different</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas of religion.</v>

1178
01:15:10.580 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 3>So forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you could see very likely a</v>

1179
01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:16.330
<v Speaker 3>scope creep with this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I also wonder,</v>

1180
01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that's the scary side.</v>

1181
01:15:18.371 --> 01:15:23.371
<v Speaker 3>The other side is I tend to be a juvie</v>
<v Speaker 3>excited the fold that any technology</v>

1182
01:15:24.851 --> 01:15:28.480
<v Speaker 3>fixed will remedy anything that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>always going to be a technology fix.</v>

1183
01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:30.870
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1184
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:36.070
<v Speaker 3>perhaps that identify you by your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a very noble aims,</v>

1185
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:40.090
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps it's enough if you can make</v>
<v Speaker 3>people think that they can be traced</v>

1186
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.273
<v Speaker 3>that sufficient.</v>

1187
01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:47.010
<v Speaker 3>Congress is committee that looks out for</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single piece of intervention.</v>

1188
01:15:47.150 --> 01:15:50.650
<v Speaker 3>So that to me sounded sounded very</v>
<v Speaker 3>boastful.</v>

1189
01:15:50.651 --> 01:15:54.960
<v Speaker 3>Like if my recollection of the bill is</v>
<v Speaker 3>accurate in</v>

1190
01:15:56.970 --> 01:15:59.020
<v Speaker 3>that same,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems like it would be pretty</v>

1191
01:15:59.021 --> 01:16:04.021
<v Speaker 3>difficult to practice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My recollection is that piece and the</v>

1192
01:16:04.290 --> 01:16:06.990
<v Speaker 3>international legal processes like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another defer to the lawyers in the room</v>

1193
01:16:06.991 --> 01:16:11.991
<v Speaker 3>and all of which</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and me is that you're looking at a</v>

1194
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:17.530
<v Speaker 3>few years currently to get many of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorts of questions resolved.</v>

1195
01:16:17.710 --> 01:16:22.710
<v Speaker 3>So going from a few years to being able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to resolve the volume of questions,</v>

1196
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:29.370
<v Speaker 3>not just from Vietnam but from all the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other countries around the world would</v>

1197
01:16:29.741 --> 01:16:33.030
<v Speaker 3>seem like the presenting the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge and I think Jonathan's</v>

1198
01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:38.130
<v Speaker 3>questions as to what's the flip side of</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is real important that we could end</v>

1199
01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:44.820
<v Speaker 3>up in a similar situation</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have to eat on go</v>

1200
01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:52.240
<v Speaker 3>what about a industry international</v>
<v Speaker 3>network of pro bono lawyers in secret</v>

1201
01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.840
<v Speaker 3>ucl as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there were definitely some fun</v>

1202
01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:57.510
<v Speaker 3>elements of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Mystique</v>

1203
01:16:59.530 --> 01:17:00.600
<v Speaker 3>is all about fun.</v>

1204
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Criticism and it didn't seem there was a</v>

1205
01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:11.210
<v Speaker 3>lot of stick</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we would expect,</v>

1206
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:15.790
<v Speaker 3>but I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought the Yahoo alerting blogs.</v>

1207
01:17:16.190 --> 01:17:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1208
01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it depends on the jurisdiction,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most places I think it's generally</v>

1209
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:24.690
<v Speaker 3>illegal and you guys got to get it</v>
<v Speaker 3>corrected.</v>

1210
01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:29.210
<v Speaker 3>If I'm wrong to alert someone that law</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement has requested their,</v>

1211
01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:31.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>

1212
01:17:31.100 --> 01:17:33.840
<v Speaker 3>unless it's for a civil procedure in</v>
<v Speaker 3>which some cases.</v>

1213
01:17:34.770 --> 01:17:39.770
<v Speaker 3>So my suspicion is that that's probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending on whose laws to follow that</v>

1214
01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:42.960
<v Speaker 3>could present some problems for them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1215
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:44.080
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1216
01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.740
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that as a way of saying is there</v>

1217
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:50.120
<v Speaker 3>some way that we can work and try to</v>
<v Speaker 3>remedy this situation internally?</v>

1218
01:17:50.740 --> 01:17:54.350
<v Speaker 3>The lobbying government doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily strike me as something</v>

1219
01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:58.610
<v Speaker 3>that's gonna go too far since that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>already happening right now,</v>

1220
01:17:58.730 --> 01:18:02.540
<v Speaker 3>but perhaps it might institute some</v>
<v Speaker 3>change,</v>

1221
01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up Bono provolone or whereas is</v>

1222
01:18:05.361 --> 01:18:07.580
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be pretty neat if you</v>

1223
01:18:07.581 --> 01:18:11.750
<v Speaker 3>could get lawyers to sign on to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But of course what we've seen in a good</v>

1224
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:14.030
<v Speaker 3>number of countries is reprisals against</v>
<v Speaker 3>those lawyers.</v>

1225
01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:19.330
<v Speaker 3>And this is often a lot of settings</v>
<v Speaker 3>which we want our jurisdiction.</v>

1226
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure you do.</v>

1227
01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.260
<v Speaker 3>But I also do think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you want them to their</v>

1228
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:36.520
<v Speaker 3>option.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you want.</v>

1229
01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:40.040
<v Speaker 3>I think that within your government</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are a lot of different factions</v>

1230
01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:43.250
<v Speaker 3>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe I'm more dug in on this sort of</v>

1231
01:18:43.251 --> 01:18:48.251
<v Speaker 3>control and others in fact may be open</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a more progressive approach and might</v>

1232
01:18:48.891 --> 01:18:50.810
<v Speaker 3>find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I suspect that this is always the</v>

1233
01:18:50.811 --> 01:18:52.670
<v Speaker 3>case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd like to talk about governance is</v>

1234
01:18:52.671 --> 01:18:56.510
<v Speaker 3>monolithic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that in fact there's more variety or</v>

1235
01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:01.540
<v Speaker 3>more diversity of views in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>government that if the these companies</v>

1236
01:19:02.031 --> 01:19:05.780
<v Speaker 3>were to lose or there were to be or to</v>
<v Speaker 3>leave or if there were to be a large</v>

1237
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:09.530
<v Speaker 3>international dispute that it would cost</v>
<v Speaker 3>you some and certainly your relationship</v>

1238
01:19:09.531 --> 01:19:10.940
<v Speaker 3>with the US.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1239
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:14.110
<v Speaker 3>I supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China is significant in terms of the</v>

1240
01:19:14.111 --> 01:19:18.280
<v Speaker 3>economic terms and I don't think while</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't necessarily want to bend over</v>

1241
01:19:18.281 --> 01:19:20.610
<v Speaker 3>backwards to please the Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1242
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:24.560
<v Speaker 3>you at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're probably not eager to,</v>

1243
01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:26.990
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to cause some major international</v>

1244
01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:32.320
<v Speaker 3>so they wouldn't take a vote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Executive catching over my two minutes</v>

1245
01:19:32.330 --> 01:19:35.270
<v Speaker 3>already.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking perhaps take a boat over</v>

1246
01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:38.930
<v Speaker 3>the class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any of your feedback on hold you here</v>

1247
01:19:38.931 --> 01:19:41.900
<v Speaker 3>any longer than we actually happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So thank you very much for</v>

1248
01:19:41.901 --> 01:19:42.800
<v Speaker 3>participating.</v>

1249
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:50.290
<v Speaker 7>Thank you.</v>
