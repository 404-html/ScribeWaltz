1
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>They're all jumbled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all jumbled together,</v>

2
00:00:12.181 --> 00:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>but they really are associated with both</v>
<v Speaker 1>my grandmothers.</v>

3
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.063
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father's mother who died when I was </v>

4
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:18.894
<v Speaker 1>pretty young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember going into her house and </v>

5
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>she lived in a walkup tenement in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bronx where my father grew up.</v>

6
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>She lived in the same apartment in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father grew up.</v>

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I do remember her making blitzes are</v>

8
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.230
<v Speaker 1>Paragi or something like that from </v>
<v Speaker 1>scratch,</v>

9
00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>making the dough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rolling it out,</v>

10
00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>filling it with cheese or potatoes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking them in that.</v>

11
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:43.663
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty incredible because I </v>

12
00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother didn't do that stuff,</v>

13
00:00:46.401 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>so I don't have a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have that little bit of that.</v>

14
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:50.533
<v Speaker 1>And then my other grandmother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the one who really did the big </v>

15
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:55.634
<v Speaker 1>family functions and would cook for 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 20 people at once and would scream </v>

16
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>at everybody in the kitchen and Dadada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she made.</v>

17
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.803
<v Speaker 1>She made very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very classic Eastern European Jewish </v>

18
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>food and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and was good at it.</v>

19
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.623
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember anything particular </v>

20
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember eating many different things.</v>

21
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a single memory though.</v>

22
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of self defense.</v>

23
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.601
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

24
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:22.434
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in New York and the food was </v>

25
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>varied,</v>

26
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>not particularly great at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out on the streets it was good.</v>

27
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>And in some of my friends' parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses it was good.</v>

28
00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:33.774
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I went away to school in </v>

29
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts where the food was </v>
<v Speaker 1>abysmal.</v>

30
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I started cooking out of self </v>

31
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:41.191
<v Speaker 1>defense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:42.024
<v Speaker 1>it's just the only way I could imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get halfway decent food was to learn </v>

33
00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>how to make it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it really began there.</v>

34
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.170
<v Speaker 1>continued through a series of roommates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whom cooked in,</v>

36
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.004
<v Speaker 1>some didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of whom were interested in what </v>

37
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was cooking,</v>

38
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just following recipes.</v>

39
00:02:00.731 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no training but they were good</v>

40
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>recipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it worked.</v>

41
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>then I had a child who started cooking </v>
<v Speaker 1>for her and then,</v>

43
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.383
<v Speaker 1>and then I started writing about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point I knew it had been eight </v>

44
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:18.140
<v Speaker 1>or 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I knew enough about food to write a</v>

45
00:02:18.141 --> 00:02:21.470
<v Speaker 1>little about it and then no pun </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended,</v>

46
00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.363
<v Speaker 1>they fed off of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was writing about food and I was </v>

47
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>cooking and I had to cook in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>write better about food.</v>

48
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's incentive to cook more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which gave me more to write about.</v>

49
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.943
<v Speaker 1>There you have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still have not ever had any formal </v>

50
00:02:35.901 --> 00:02:36.734
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>

51
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just distinguish between chefs and</v>

52
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.140
<v Speaker 1>cooks because I think this is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a chef,</v>

53
00:02:45.141 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>as a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

54
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that word is thrown around a lot,</v>

55
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:50.390
<v Speaker 1>but a chef as a person who runs the </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant,</v>

56
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 1>so people who cook at home or cooks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with that.</v>

57
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who like to cook our cooks and I,</v>

58
00:02:57.741 --> 00:02:58.574
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's a word that's been </v>

59
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>sadly denigrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

60
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a lovely word.</v>

61
00:03:04.691 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>It's an important word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what are the most experience,</v>

62
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>what are the most important techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

63
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>shall we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novice cooks?</v>

64
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.653
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

65
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.820
<v Speaker 1>well reading I think is probably a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important technique because probably the</v>

66
00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:25.821
<v Speaker 1>best way to learn how to cook remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a couple of decent cookbooks and</v>

67
00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.263
<v Speaker 1>working your way through them and paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to what they're asking and </v>

68
00:03:30.241 --> 00:03:33.510
<v Speaker 1>learning a few of the terms and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

69
00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such an easy,</v>

71
00:03:36.721 --> 00:03:40.440
<v Speaker 1>it's so much easier than playing tennis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

72
00:03:40.441 --> 00:03:41.274
<v Speaker 1>that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just a matter of starting to do it </v>

73
00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:48.060
<v Speaker 1>and then doing it over and over again </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you kind of get it.</v>

74
00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.133
<v Speaker 1>So it has more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's presented as a highly skilled </v>

75
00:03:52.561 --> 00:03:53.394
<v Speaker 1>occupation and indeed for real chefs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>people running restaurants or people </v>

76
00:03:56.281 --> 00:04:01.281
<v Speaker 1>doing demonstrations on food television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy,</v>

77
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>but for most of us it's not any harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>than driving a car.</v>

78
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:06.534
<v Speaker 1>It just needs a little practice off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>top of my head without looking at my </v>

79
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:14.324
<v Speaker 1>pantry.</v>

80
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>A garlic olive oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's too,</v>

81
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

82
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>it sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

83
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard question because do you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to count rice and Pasta?</v>

84
00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to count vinegar and Lemons?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to count onions and eggs?</v>

85
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that gets you close to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that there are,</v>

86
00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>I would say there are probably 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between 25 and 50,</v>

87
00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:42.044
<v Speaker 1>but say 30 ingredients that should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much in every kitchen all the </v>

88
00:04:44.961 --> 00:04:46.970
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten is not going to do it.</v>

89
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't do much with 10,</v>

90
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:50.773
<v Speaker 1>but if you have 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can start doing serious cooking and </v>

91
00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>if you have those 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:57.133
<v Speaker 1>and you stop at the store and pick up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of meat or fish and some </v>

93
00:05:00.171 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something fresh,</v>

94
00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.773
<v Speaker 1>you're completely in business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can cook half of what there is to </v>

95
00:05:04.761 --> 00:05:06.590
<v Speaker 1>cook in all over the world.</v>

96
00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.960
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't use high enough heat,</v>

97
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people don't preheat their pants and</v>

98
00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.480
<v Speaker 1>their ovens and things like that enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:22.843
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to put a crust on </v>

100
00:05:25.221 --> 00:05:28.010
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pan needs to be hot.</v>

101
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>The butter oil needs to be hot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

102
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 1>these are things that trained people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Learn home.</v>

103
00:05:32.991 --> 00:05:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Cooks are a little afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tend to be a little of a beginning home.</v>

104
00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Cooks tend to be a little afraid of high</v>
<v Speaker 1>heat,</v>

105
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.383
<v Speaker 1>so that's a mistake people make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having lousy knives is a mistake people </v>

106
00:05:44.451 --> 00:05:45.284
<v Speaker 1>make and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that they don't have expensive </v>

107
00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 1>knives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that they don't have sharp knives.</v>

108
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.723
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending too much money on cooking </v>

109
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:55.184
<v Speaker 1>equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a mistake a lot of people make </v>

110
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>because you don't need to a lot of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>on cooking equipment.</v>

111
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>What else can I think of?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Attitude is interesting because,</v>

113
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:08.390
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tend to be intimidated by cooking</v>

114
00:06:08.391 --> 00:06:09.920
<v Speaker 1>and there's nothing to be intimidated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

115
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>As I said at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really pretty simple.</v>

116
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:16.991
<v Speaker 1>So the right attitude is the attitude of</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to get something going on,</v>

117
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

118
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid of this,</v>

119
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:20.530
<v Speaker 1>but nor is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

120
00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be bobby flay and do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something breathtaking.</v>

121
00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:25.770
<v Speaker 1>It's just going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to,</v>

122
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>just like my grandma had cooked for my </v>
<v Speaker 1>mom,</v>

123
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to cook for my friends </v>
<v Speaker 1>or my kids or whatever,</v>

124
00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:33.140
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:06:33.141 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>normal food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food you like.</v>

126
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spices in general go under appreciated </v>

127
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:41.954
<v Speaker 1>by American cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the spices that that most </v>

128
00:06:44.421 --> 00:06:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Americans used in cooking tended to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>

129
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.120
<v Speaker 1>you might call them warm spices are </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet spices,</v>

130
00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>like the kind of stuff you put an apple </v>
<v Speaker 1>pie,</v>

131
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>cinnamon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all spice,</v>

132
00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.620
<v Speaker 1>nutmeg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cloves,</v>

133
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.753
<v Speaker 1>ginger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of chilies are certainly </v>

134
00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more popular in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>

135
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.393
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mild chili powders is a wonderful </v>

136
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:09.040
<v Speaker 1>ingredient that's still not fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciated.</v>

137
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.741
<v Speaker 1>P,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentone,</v>

138
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>which is mild smoked Paprika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a form of Chili,</v>

139
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>so mild smoked chili patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish ingredient,</v>

140
00:07:17.481 --> 00:07:22.481
<v Speaker 1>really fabulous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the Indian spices or Asian spices,</v>

141
00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 1>however you want to call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be under appreciated it.</v>

142
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.830
<v Speaker 1>And these are really simple things to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

143
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.673
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the problem is when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you add four or five spices to a </v>

144
00:07:31.661 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes the recipe look long,</v>

145
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:35.480
<v Speaker 1>makes the ingredient list look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look long,</v>

146
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.820
<v Speaker 1>and no one wants to see a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredient list.</v>

147
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>So when writing recipes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one has to be careful,</v>

148
00:07:41.631 --> 00:07:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spices are really,</v>

149
00:07:43.491 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>if you replace them every now and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that they're fairly fresh,</v>

150
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.860
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're easy to use,</v>

151
00:07:48.861 --> 00:07:51.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not a big deal and they make a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

152
00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:02.080
<v Speaker 1>I often don't figure out what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking until an hour before people come</v>

153
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:03.794
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I make sure there's food in the </v>

154
00:08:06.171 --> 00:08:07.730
<v Speaker 1>house and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's an important,</v>

155
00:08:07.731 --> 00:08:08.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

156
00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.363
<v Speaker 1>it seems so obvious when you say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so many people don't do it if you </v>

157
00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:16.244
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of food in the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking as much easier because now you </v>

158
00:08:19.521 --> 00:08:20.354
<v Speaker 1>have so many options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus there's pressure on you to cook </v>

159
00:08:22.701 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>because you don't want the stuff to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

160
00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>So what I cook for people pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on what I have.</v>

161
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I try to always have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.863
<v Speaker 1>something I've made a deal with a friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was an architect and he designed an </v>

163
00:08:39.651 --> 00:08:41.350
<v Speaker 1>office for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

164
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.073
<v Speaker 1>the deal was that I was going to cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinner for him and his wife and two of </v>

165
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>his friends and my wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're going to be six of us and uh,</v>

166
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>we set a date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess he says we set a date and uh,</v>

167
00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.410
<v Speaker 1>morning that afternoon actually by 2:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>he called and said,</v>

168
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>so what time do you want us to go over?</v>

169
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I'd completely forgotten about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went shopping and I made,</v>

170
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran out to the store.</v>

171
00:09:07.741 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I came back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made,</v>

172
00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>it was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

173
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made roast chicken with,</v>

174
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 1>with vinegar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sort of a classic French recipe,</v>

175
00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:21.803
<v Speaker 1>some kind of potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a salad and I don't know if I made or </v>

176
00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:27.474
<v Speaker 1>bought a bread and I made chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mousse for dessert and I did that on </v>

177
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>about two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for me is a lot of,</v>

178
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of time in the kitchen for </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

179
00:09:35.281 --> 00:09:37.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't spend two hours in the kitchen </v>
<v Speaker 1>that often is.</v>

180
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>The great thing was the food was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>that great,</v>

181
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:42.840
<v Speaker 1>but the food was fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great thing was,</v>

182
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got away with it,</v>

183
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:46.920
<v Speaker 1>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they thought it was fantastic and it was</v>

184
00:09:46.921 --> 00:09:51.921
<v Speaker 1>then that I realized that if you cook </v>
<v Speaker 1>for people in your home,</v>

185
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking forward to it.</v>

186
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are going to cut you so much.</v>

187
00:09:57.871 --> 00:09:58.704
<v Speaker 1>Slack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to give you every benefit </v>

188
00:10:01.081 --> 00:10:01.914
<v Speaker 1>of the doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be grateful and </v>

189
00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:04.863
<v Speaker 1>therefore the food is gonna taste better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it would if you're in a restaurant </v>

190
00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:09.054
<v Speaker 1>where the server was annoying you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew you were going to spend a lot </v>

191
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:12.684
<v Speaker 1>of money and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to travel to get there and blah </v>

192
00:10:15.131 --> 00:10:18.040
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it was real and that was,</v>

193
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.150
<v Speaker 1>that was probably 12 or 15 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's about halfway into my.</v>

194
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.073
<v Speaker 1>I've been cooking for 40 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so it was a third of the two thirds </v>

195
00:10:29.851 --> 00:10:30.684
<v Speaker 1>of the way into my life as a cook when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized that you can do pretty much </v>

196
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.523
<v Speaker 1>anything in your home if you take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously and do it as well as you can </v>

197
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.620
<v Speaker 1>do it and your friends and family are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really going to appreciate it.</v>

198
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.493
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

199
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:48.843
<v Speaker 1>my presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's other kinds of mark </v>

200
00:10:51.521 --> 00:10:52.870
<v Speaker 1>bittman meals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

201
00:10:52.871 --> 00:10:53.291
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:10:53.291 --> 00:10:55.450
<v Speaker 1>really its simplicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's honesty.</v>

203
00:10:55.451 --> 00:10:56.284
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

204
00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.160
<v Speaker 1>it's not overdoing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generally speaking,</v>

205
00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:04.840
<v Speaker 1>it's very few ingredients and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>little technique and not that much time.</v>

206
00:11:04.841 --> 00:11:07.270
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's home cooking.</v>

207
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing fancy about it.</v>

208
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:13.810
<v Speaker 1>There's no pretense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to think there's no pretense.</v>

209
00:11:13.811 --> 00:11:14.644
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all,</v>

210
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.600
<v Speaker 1>it sounds too good to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like better than I am,</v>

211
00:11:19.601 --> 00:11:23.560
<v Speaker 1>but it really is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I'll take some credit for it.</v>

212
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 1>I think if you are a true food lover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a healthy eater.</v>

213
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:33.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

214
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.340
<v Speaker 1>the term Foodie is completely ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 1>because for someone,</v>

215
00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:42.010
<v Speaker 1>when you meet somebody and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really love to eat,</v>

216
00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:45.040
<v Speaker 1>I think the appropriate answer is who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't?</v>

217
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.590
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look around,</v>

218
00:11:47.591 --> 00:11:48.191
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:50.440
<v Speaker 1>who's not a food lover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's a food lover.</v>

220
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.663
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we responsibly due for your own </v>

221
00:11:54.341 --> 00:11:55.174
<v Speaker 1>benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you eat for your planets benefit and </v>

222
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>the wheat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best food possible?</v>

223
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 1>If the answer to all of those things is </v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

224
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.370
<v Speaker 1>then you're eating well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating,</v>

225
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.130
<v Speaker 1>you know if your style of eating is bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your body,</v>

226
00:12:06.131 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>if your style of eating is bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

227
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.750
<v Speaker 1>than you are not really eating good </v>
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>

228
00:12:10.751 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 1>you're eating lousy food and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we know,</v>

229
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:17.851
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of lousy food around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principled,</v>

230
00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.510
<v Speaker 1>the principled way to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were going to say,</v>

231
00:12:22.511 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat entirely for my own </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit,</v>

232
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat entirely for the benefit </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the planet.</v>

233
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.283
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat in the most responsible </v>
<v Speaker 1>way possible to minimize my carbon </v>

234
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>footprint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to minimize my impact overall,</v>

235
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>to minimize my effect on animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would be a Vegan.</v>

236
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.303
<v Speaker 1>That's the bottom line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The veganism is the most principled way </v>

237
00:12:45.641 --> 00:12:46.474
<v Speaker 1>to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That there is from the perspective of </v>

238
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>your own body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of the planet,</v>

239
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:54.010
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few people are going to be vegans.</v>

240
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:55.810
<v Speaker 1>Let's be real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

241
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:58.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's next?</v>

242
00:12:58.810 --> 00:12:59.643
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand you have vegans and on </v>

243
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the other hand you have people who eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they feel like eating.</v>

244
00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:07.203
<v Speaker 1>There's a middle ground.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the way most Americans </v>

245
00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:14.761
<v Speaker 1>eat right now is that we are about as </v>
<v Speaker 1>far from veganism as we could be,</v>

246
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:21.511
<v Speaker 1>so a vegan would get 100 percent of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>or her calories from plants.</v>

247
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:27.150
<v Speaker 1>Most Americans get 90 percent of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories from processed food,</v>

248
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.053
<v Speaker 1>junk food and animal products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the goal I think is to move in the </v>

249
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:35.344
<v Speaker 1>direction of eating more unprocessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>plant food than we do now and </v>

250
00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:40.720
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got a different starting </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

251
00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.840
<v Speaker 1>If you read 20 cheeseburgers a week or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the equivalent,</v>

252
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.330
<v Speaker 1>you might look at eating 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburgers,</v>

253
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:48.850
<v Speaker 1>so weak or the equivalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're eating 15,</v>

254
00:13:48.851 --> 00:13:53.851
<v Speaker 1>you might look at eating 10 and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think if people think about what's</v>

255
00:13:54.011 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 1>best for their body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's best for the planet,</v>

256
00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:56.763
<v Speaker 1>the answer is eating unprocessed plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and then think about how can I eat </v>

257
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.880
<v Speaker 1>more of that stuff at the expense of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was,</v>

258
00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 1>which was the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also at the expensive processed food</v>

259
00:14:09.731 --> 00:14:10.564
<v Speaker 1>and junk food.</v>

260
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:18.490
<v Speaker 1>The ideas deed as many unprocessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants as you can.</v>

261
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.500
<v Speaker 1>What are plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plants or vegetables,</v>

262
00:14:20.501 --> 00:14:21.520
<v Speaker 1>fruits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legumes,</v>

263
00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:23.680
<v Speaker 1>which means beans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuts and seeds.</v>

264
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I leaving out?</v>

265
00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:28.343
<v Speaker 1>I think that's about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is to eat as many </v>

266
00:14:31.331 --> 00:14:32.164
<v Speaker 1>unprocessed plants as you possibly can </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to eat those instead of eating </v>

267
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>processed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>junk foods and animal products.</v>

268
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.793
<v Speaker 1>But works for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's worked for me for just about </v>

269
00:14:45.521 --> 00:14:48.940
<v Speaker 1>three years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What works for me is to eat very,</v>

270
00:14:48.941 --> 00:14:49.774
<v Speaker 1>very strict diet of plants only and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unprocessed plants only from the time I </v>

271
00:14:53.871 --> 00:14:55.610
<v Speaker 1>wake up in the morning until dinner </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

272
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>So from the time I wake up until roughly</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark,</v>

273
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of fruit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat a lot of vegetables,</v>

274
00:15:02.471 --> 00:15:03.304
<v Speaker 1>I eat some whole grains and sometimes I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some beans and that's pretty much </v>

275
00:15:07.371 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then at night I eat whatever I want.</v>

276
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:10.933
<v Speaker 1>And that's the which includes meeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes wine and which includes </v>

277
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.560
<v Speaker 1>pasta and bread and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a huge change for me.</v>

278
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:21.400
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you think of your diet </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a seesaw with the,</v>

279
00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:23.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the animal products,</v>

280
00:15:23.811 --> 00:15:24.644
<v Speaker 1>the process with the junk food on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy side as it is for most people and </v>

281
00:15:27.171 --> 00:15:30.860
<v Speaker 1>the unprocessed plants on the light side</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is for most people.</v>

282
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.933
<v Speaker 1>I think for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my seesaw went from looking something </v>

283
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:36.380
<v Speaker 1>like this to looking something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

284
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that to the extent other people </v>
<v Speaker 1>can eat that way,</v>

285
00:15:39.381 --> 00:15:44.360
<v Speaker 1>they will have a have a lesser impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet,</v>

286
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>improve their health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably lose weight,</v>

287
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:48.313
<v Speaker 1>feel better.</v>

288
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Think I just decided to change the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of some of the things we've been</v>

289
00:15:57.561 --> 00:15:58.394
<v Speaker 1>talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is that I recognize that I'm one of </v>

290
00:16:04.101 --> 00:16:04.934
<v Speaker 1>the highest contributors to greenhouse </v>
<v Speaker 1>gases and global warming is the is the </v>

291
00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:10.940
<v Speaker 1>industrial production of livestock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I decided,</v>

292
00:16:10.941 --> 00:16:11.774
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one good reason to eat less </v>

293
00:16:13.011 --> 00:16:13.844
<v Speaker 1>meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other good reasons he lifts me is </v>

294
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:19.070
<v Speaker 1>that I was in my mid fifties and my </v>
<v Speaker 1>health wasn't what it used to be,</v>

295
00:16:19.071 --> 00:16:21.290
<v Speaker 1>so I was overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had bad knees,</v>

296
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.640
<v Speaker 1>I had sleep apnea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had high cholesterol,</v>

297
00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I had high blood sugar or borderline </v>
<v Speaker 1>high blood sugar.</v>

298
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.650
<v Speaker 1>I think that's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

299
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:35.651
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to change my diet and it's,</v>

300
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.703
<v Speaker 1>it's so obvious to everyone who pays any</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to nutrition at all that if </v>

301
00:16:41.661 --> 00:16:44.180
<v Speaker 1>you want to be healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to do that is,</v>

302
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've already said,</v>

303
00:16:45.531 --> 00:16:49.580
<v Speaker 1>is to eat fewer animal products than eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>less processed and junk foods.</v>

304
00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 1>So I started to do that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it worked.</v>

305
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:56.750
<v Speaker 1>I lost 35 pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained five of them back,</v>

306
00:16:56.751 --> 00:17:00.650
<v Speaker 1>but hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a slept sleep apnea went away.</v>

307
00:17:00.651 --> 00:17:03.260
<v Speaker 1>I slept better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my knees bothered me much less.</v>

308
00:17:03.261 --> 00:17:05.390
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran the New York marathon last year,</v>

309
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my cholesterol is back to normal and my </v>

310
00:17:08.001 --> 00:17:10.040
<v Speaker 1>blood sugars back to normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it all worked.</v>

311
00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 1>And it's not a coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

312
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:17.440
<v Speaker 1>no one would say it was a coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually not.</v>

313
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some things I don't like,</v>

314
00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that there's no sort of single</v>

315
00:17:26.570 --> 00:17:27.403
<v Speaker 1>arsenic and cyanide aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not really a single ingredient </v>

316
00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:32.750
<v Speaker 1>that's going to outright kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

317
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:36.920
<v Speaker 1>there's actually some evidence that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single can of soda can trigger diabetes,</v>

318
00:17:36.921 --> 00:17:40.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's not a lot of eps evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that in general.</v>

319
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>One ingredient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one little kinds of food,</v>

320
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.580
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one meal,</v>

321
00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:47.443
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even one week that's not what's </v>

322
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:52.230
<v Speaker 1>determinant of your overall health or of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your impact on the planet.</v>

323
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:56.310
<v Speaker 1>What determines is your overall diet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's moving in the right direction,</v>

324
00:17:56.311 --> 00:18:01.200
<v Speaker 1>which for most Americans is towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants and away from animal products and</v>

325
00:18:01.201 --> 00:18:03.180
<v Speaker 1>processed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>

326
00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:03.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hip,</v>

327
00:18:03.871 --> 00:18:04.580
<v Speaker 1>hip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hooray,</v>

328
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way to go.</v>

329
00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a great vegan chef.</v>

330
00:18:12.181 --> 00:18:13.014
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there were a few at this point </v>

331
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:16.600
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

332
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>

333
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:20.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually this is an interesting story.</v>

334
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I met a Vegan chef from Japan a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>of years ago,</v>

335
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:27.090
<v Speaker 1>tiny tiny woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

336
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:33.230
<v Speaker 1>really interesting and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not a Vegan in her personal life,</v>

337
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:37.130
<v Speaker 1>but she was a Vegan chef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She ran it small,</v>

338
00:18:37.131 --> 00:18:41.090
<v Speaker 1>maybe 12 or 20 seat restaurant in Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

339
00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:42.373
<v Speaker 1>and everything was strictly Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I found that she wasn't a </v>

340
00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

341
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:48.140
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't get this.</v>

342
00:18:48.141 --> 00:18:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would you choose to,</v>

343
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.690
<v Speaker 1>it's not a matter of principle for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>because you eat meat,</v>

344
00:18:53.691 --> 00:18:54.524
<v Speaker 1>you eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would you choose to narrow what you </v>

345
00:18:58.401 --> 00:19:00.380
<v Speaker 1>serve your customers when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself?</v>

346
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Eat from the broadest spectrum possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she said,</v>

347
00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:05.383
<v Speaker 1>it's like pen and ink.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who choose to be </v>

348
00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.133
<v Speaker 1>artists and only pen and ink because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to narrow the world in which </v>

349
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.090
<v Speaker 1>they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as to more fully explore it.</v>

350
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:18.223
<v Speaker 1>And I want to narrow the world in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm cooking so I can understand that </v>

351
00:19:21.561 --> 00:19:23.690
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she was an amazing,</v>

352
00:19:23.691 --> 00:19:25.100
<v Speaker 1>amazing chef.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She made great,</v>

353
00:19:25.101 --> 00:19:25.934
<v Speaker 1>great stuff.</v>

354
00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:30.821
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:19:30.821 --> 00:19:33.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be guessing to answer that question.</v>

356
00:19:33.671 --> 00:19:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a confluence of a bunch of things.</v>

357
00:19:38.231 --> 00:19:42.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first off I guess is that we,</v>

358
00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.080
<v Speaker 1>we like fads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

359
00:19:44.081 --> 00:19:46.450
<v Speaker 1>we like trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's the one that hadn't been fully</v>

360
00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:48.280
<v Speaker 1>exploited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

361
00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:53.170
<v Speaker 1>food television really had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had a huge impact.</v>

362
00:19:53.171 --> 00:19:57.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean cooking and eating as a spectator</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport never before in history.</v>

363
00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's had a huge impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Third,</v>

364
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I think is the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internationalization of food people,</v>

365
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:08.500
<v Speaker 1>not only people traveling and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>food from the rest of the world,</v>

366
00:20:08.501 --> 00:20:09.334
<v Speaker 1>but ingredients and types of cuisines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and restaurants arriving here in </v>

367
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:15.520
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

368
00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:18.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the short answer is exposure,</v>

369
00:20:18.131 --> 00:20:21.820
<v Speaker 1>but it still doesn't explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't explain.</v>

370
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.960
<v Speaker 1>You're going to walk into a party and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having someone come up to you and say,</v>

371
00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:30.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm a foodie and there's something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of trendiness.</v>

372
00:20:30.641 --> 00:20:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like saying,</v>

373
00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a closed person.</v>

374
00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:35.991
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

375
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:38.090
<v Speaker 1>we all wear clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a closed person.</v>

376
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>The thing that makes me most upset about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big fat is that more people are not</v>

377
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.580
<v Speaker 1>cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

378
00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.463
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fine to watch other people </v>

379
00:20:46.491 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 1>cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then people say,</v>

380
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too busy to cook.</v>

381
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:50.403
<v Speaker 1>And they're too busy to cook because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're watching people cook on </v>

382
00:20:52.031 --> 00:20:54.280
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't track for me.</v>

383
00:20:54.281 --> 00:20:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really bad.</v>

384
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Now the one is real and what is not is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

385
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:03.710
<v Speaker 1>really difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I,</v>

386
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.553
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

387
00:21:05.530 --> 00:21:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't answer that.</v>

388
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's real and what's not.</v>

389
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 1>One has to hope that things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>certified organic are organic,</v>

390
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.430
<v Speaker 1>but what does organic mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

391
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:20.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a term that's defined by the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States Department of Agriculture.</v>

392
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:21.543
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything or it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean much about how the animals are </v>

393
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:25.030
<v Speaker 1>treated.</v>

394
00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:25.863
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really mean much about what </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind or what breed of the animals there </v>

395
00:21:28.801 --> 00:21:31.360
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean anything in terms of how</v>

396
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.823
<v Speaker 1>the workers who were raising these </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals or farming these crops are </v>

397
00:21:37.991 --> 00:21:41.200
<v Speaker 1>treated doesn't mean anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>where the food is from.</v>

398
00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.920
<v Speaker 1>So does organic have some meaning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

399
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the term organic has some </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting,</v>

400
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.080
<v Speaker 1>but I think that it's not the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important thing.</v>

401
00:21:50.081 --> 00:21:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I won't go so far as to say that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>red herring because I think it's.</v>

402
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:56.470
<v Speaker 1>There are some important things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

403
00:21:56.471 --> 00:22:01.030
<v Speaker 1>but I will say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important division in our style</v>

404
00:22:01.031 --> 00:22:01.864
<v Speaker 1>of eating right now is not organic </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus non organic and it's not local </v>

405
00:22:05.711 --> 00:22:09.760
<v Speaker 1>versus non local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's plants versus anything else and you</v>

406
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:10.594
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

407
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean to be repetitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the message to me,</v>

408
00:22:14.531 --> 00:22:16.090
<v Speaker 1>the message is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear.</v>

409
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:20.950
<v Speaker 1>The way that people can eat best is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>eat less crap,</v>

410
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:21.873
<v Speaker 1>to put it bluntly and crap is processed </v>
<v Speaker 1>food and junk food and you can have </v>

411
00:22:25.691 --> 00:22:30.691
<v Speaker 1>organic process food and you can have </v>
<v Speaker 1>organic junk food and that food is.</v>

412
00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a little better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonorganic process than junk food,</v>

413
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good food and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important lesson we can learn.</v>

414
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:40.654
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

415
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:46.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

416
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.110
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the clear answer is that,</v>

417
00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:53.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as your body is concerned,</v>

418
00:22:53.531 --> 00:22:57.550
<v Speaker 1>a grape from Chile is better than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger from around the corner.</v>

419
00:22:57.850 --> 00:23:01.270
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to eat turnips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrots,</v>

420
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:06.520
<v Speaker 1>a bread,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bake yourself frozen meat,</v>

421
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:10.360
<v Speaker 1>a very limited diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can eat locally almost anywhere,</v>

422
00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:13.120
<v Speaker 1>at least in this country all year round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's great,</v>

423
00:23:13.121 --> 00:23:13.954
<v Speaker 1>but it's expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's inconvenient than it takes </v>

424
00:23:15.401 --> 00:23:16.234
<v Speaker 1>dedication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a swell idea and I think </v>

425
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:22.150
<v Speaker 1>that ultimately for food to make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country,</v>

426
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.273
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to see more </v>
<v Speaker 1>regionalism and less food coming out of </v>

427
00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:28.114
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we'll ever be at a </v>

428
00:23:29.681 --> 00:23:34.120
<v Speaker 1>place where we see no food coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>California unless it falls into the sea.</v>

429
00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

430
00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.780
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that if you're,</v>

431
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:40.060
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be truly a local,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either,</v>

432
00:23:40.061 --> 00:23:41.200
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be drinking.</v>

433
00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>If you're living in the northeast as I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

434
00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:44.470
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be drinking any </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

435
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:46.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be drinking any </v>
<v Speaker 1>caffeinated tea.</v>

436
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:49.250
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be using any olive </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

437
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:53.180
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of things you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be missing out on.</v>

438
00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:54.433
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that that's the highest </v>

439
00:23:55.551 --> 00:23:59.240
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other priorities.</v>

440
00:23:59.241 --> 00:24:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

441
00:24:00.410 --> 00:24:02.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fan of local food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really like local food.</v>

442
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:06.980
<v Speaker 1>But to go back to the discussion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trendiness in food,</v>

443
00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.280
<v Speaker 1>everything need not be taken to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme.</v>

444
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 1>And this is another thing that's being </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been taken to an extreme,</v>

445
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:18.853
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I'm driving say six hours and I </v>

446
00:24:21.171 --> 00:24:25.670
<v Speaker 1>decided to stop at Wendy's or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's a twinge of guilt,</v>

447
00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:30.530
<v Speaker 1>but there's also an excuse because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're away and you know,</v>

448
00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.150
<v Speaker 1>you're busy and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

449
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.880
<v Speaker 1>And I don't exercise that excuse very </v>
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>

450
00:24:34.881 --> 00:24:35.714
<v Speaker 1>So I don't really feel guilty about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what would make me feel guilty </v>

451
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.823
<v Speaker 1>and I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is I'm going to the supermarket and </v>

452
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:46.850
<v Speaker 1>buying a huge bag of potato chips and </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming home and eating it,</v>

453
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:52.180
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why do they choose?</v>

454
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.943
<v Speaker 1>Because they want something comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want something they're familiar </v>

455
00:24:57.081 --> 00:24:58.640
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all want bacon and eggs,</v>

456
00:24:58.641 --> 00:24:59.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

457
00:24:59.151 --> 00:25:00.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my guests.</v>

458
00:25:00.591 --> 00:25:01.424
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants for Friday eggs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>butter with unlimited supply of Bacon </v>

459
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 1>and really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really great toast.</v>

460
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

461
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Am I being executed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get the scenarios.</v>

462
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:20.360
<v Speaker 1>Assuming I'm being executed and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a last meal.</v>

463
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't want to think about cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>last meals.</v>

464
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:26.690
<v Speaker 1>I want to think about execution last </v>
<v Speaker 1>meals.</v>

465
00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.520
<v Speaker 1>I would call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

466
00:25:28.521 --> 00:25:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm privileged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can do this.</v>

467
00:25:29.841 --> 00:25:30.674
<v Speaker 1>I would call my friend John George </v>
<v Speaker 1>vongerichten and tell him I want him to </v>

468
00:25:33.621 --> 00:25:37.340
<v Speaker 1>cook for me until I tell them to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be my last meal,</v>

469
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:41.780
<v Speaker 1>but I do like the four or six eggs </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked in a lot of butter with bacon and</v>

470
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.120
<v Speaker 1>really good toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like that too.</v>

471
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:52.990
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more authentic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the problem with salt too,</v>

472
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.210
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that there is a problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with salt and this is not really,</v>

473
00:25:56.211 --> 00:25:57.044
<v Speaker 1>really clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the extent that there is a </v>

474
00:25:58.221 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 1>promise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the salt and processed foods.</v>

475
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:04.040
<v Speaker 1>People who don't eat a lot of processed </v>
<v Speaker 1>foods don't have problems with salt.</v>

476
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:08.630
<v Speaker 1>People who add their own salt to food </v>
<v Speaker 1>have no problems with salt.</v>

477
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.733
<v Speaker 1>Chefs who make their own chefs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants who cooked from scratch and </v>

478
00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:13.904
<v Speaker 1>add salt to their taste or to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perceived taste of their diners are not </v>

479
00:26:17.901 --> 00:26:18.734
<v Speaker 1>adding criminal amounts of salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to limit the amount of salt </v>

480
00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:25.040
<v Speaker 1>mix dot McDonald's puts in it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>processed foods,</v>

481
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.143
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to limit the amount of food </v>

482
00:26:28.131 --> 00:26:29.240
<v Speaker 1>they can sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

483
00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:32.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a salt problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an overall food problem.</v>

484
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it is happening,</v>

485
00:26:38.991 --> 00:26:41.340
<v Speaker 1>which is really amazing that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

486
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.730
<v Speaker 1>the mayor of Philadelphia just proposed </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

487
00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:46.253
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proponents of a soda tax or </v>

488
00:26:47.071 --> 00:26:50.220
<v Speaker 1>generally proposing a penny per ounce as</v>
<v Speaker 1>an excise tax,</v>

489
00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:51.054
<v Speaker 1>which means 12 ounce can of soda might </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost the dollar 12 instead of a dollar </v>

490
00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:56.483
<v Speaker 1>and at a 24 pack case of Soda Might </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cross my double in price from a sale </v>

491
00:27:04.381 --> 00:27:08.730
<v Speaker 1>price of two 99 or three 99.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really incredible.</v>

492
00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:10.830
<v Speaker 1>The guy in Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is nutter,</v>

493
00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.353
<v Speaker 1>but it's his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy in Philadelphia is proposing to </v>

494
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:18.960
<v Speaker 1>cents per ounce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite amazing because it</v>

495
00:27:18.961 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 1>means a dollar can of soda would cross </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dollar and a quarter,</v>

496
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 1>a 32 ounce bottle of soda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a dollar.</v>

497
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 1>It costs a dollar 32 and oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dollar 64 and so on.</v>

498
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:32.010
<v Speaker 1>So I think it is happening.</v>

499
00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.113
<v Speaker 1>Why is it important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soda is the leading source of calories </v>

500
00:27:37.231 --> 00:27:38.064
<v Speaker 1>for Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans get seven percent of their </v>

501
00:27:39.631 --> 00:27:40.464
<v Speaker 1>calories from soda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more than they get from any </v>

502
00:27:41.761 --> 00:27:44.880
<v Speaker 1>other single food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's think about this.</v>

503
00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:45.923
<v Speaker 1>It's non-nutritive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say it has no benefit </v>

504
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:53.430
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None like it's not harmless,</v>

505
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:55.740
<v Speaker 1>it's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

506
00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:59.190
<v Speaker 1>it's a leading causes of obesity in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

507
00:27:59.191 --> 00:28:00.024
<v Speaker 1>I mean if obesity is a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to look at where the calories </v>

508
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:03.834
<v Speaker 1>are coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If soda is the number one source of </v>

509
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:06.384
<v Speaker 1>calories in the United States and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not a beneficial sources of calories is </v>

510
00:28:10.771 --> 00:28:11.604
<v Speaker 1>something people can do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're obese and you're looking </v>

511
00:28:13.681 --> 00:28:14.514
<v Speaker 1>for ways to help people figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can do without soda is a very good </v>

512
00:28:18.361 --> 00:28:19.194
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the tax is a very smart </v>

513
00:28:20.881 --> 00:28:21.714
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some research that shows that </v>

514
00:28:23.221 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 1>taxing junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which thought is a junk food tax,</v>

515
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:29.370
<v Speaker 1>taxing junk food is more likely to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>people eat well.</v>

516
00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.413
<v Speaker 1>Then subsidizing healthy food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The irony is that if you subsidize </v>

517
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:33.804
<v Speaker 1>healthy food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will take the money they're </v>

518
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:37.350
<v Speaker 1>saving and buy junk food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sad but true.</v>

519
00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.640
<v Speaker 1>I think the soda tax makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's happening,</v>

520
00:28:41.641 --> 00:28:44.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to happen this year </v>
<v Speaker 1>and next year I think it's going to be a</v>

521
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:45.744
<v Speaker 1>swell of soda taxes and I think once the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greedy state legislatures realized they </v>

522
00:28:50.461 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 1>can make money on this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have even more momentum.</v>

523
00:28:58.140 --> 00:28:58.973
<v Speaker 1>I moved this year and I moved from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen that was six by seven to a </v>

524
00:29:02.281 --> 00:29:03.930
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a bad eight by eight,</v>

525
00:29:03.931 --> 00:29:07.770
<v Speaker 1>so it's an eight by eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's seven by seven.</v>

526
00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.630
<v Speaker 1>It's 50 something square feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

527
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.810
<v Speaker 1>it has counselors on two sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a refrigerator on a third side,</v>

528
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:18.330
<v Speaker 1>has drawers on the fourth side and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has two doors.</v>

529
00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:19.603
<v Speaker 1>It has a sink and dishwasher and a stove</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has maybe six feet of counter </v>

530
00:29:23.941 --> 00:29:28.941
<v Speaker 1>space and nothing is fancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's for me nearly perfect.</v>

531
00:29:30.541 --> 00:29:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wish I could fit more,</v>

532
00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.400
<v Speaker 1>like I wish I could fit a table in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wish I could fit more people in it</v>

533
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.430
<v Speaker 1>to hang out with while I was cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

534
00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty great.</v>

535
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.783
<v Speaker 1>It's really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing that was nothing </v>

536
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:49.981
<v Speaker 1>unusual or remarkable about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

537
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.480
<v Speaker 1>this goes back to something I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about before.</v>

538
00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:56.210
<v Speaker 1>The way that recipes happened for me is</v>

539
00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.250
<v Speaker 1>shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all starts with shopping.</v>

540
00:30:01.251 --> 00:30:03.320
<v Speaker 1>So I will go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to China town a lot,</v>

541
00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:04.843
<v Speaker 1>I go to a decent supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to green markets and I try to buy </v>

542
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:14.180
<v Speaker 1>everything that looks good that I think </v>
<v Speaker 1>I can cook in the next x days.</v>

543
00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:17.150
<v Speaker 1>Am I cooking at home for the next four </v>
<v Speaker 1>days?</v>

544
00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Because to be home for four days in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row is a lot.</v>

545
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:21.043
<v Speaker 1>I'll buy four days of food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll buy a lot and then I will go </v>

546
00:30:25.131 --> 00:30:25.964
<v Speaker 1>home and I will cook what I bought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always a because I have no </v>

547
00:30:33.141 --> 00:30:37.670
<v Speaker 1>patience with cooking from recipes be </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not that methodical.</v>

548
00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.800
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I have a bad memory.</v>

549
00:30:39.801 --> 00:30:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I always think I'm making things up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even do that.</v>

550
00:30:42.741 --> 00:30:43.574
<v Speaker 1>Implicate my own recipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens is there's this house full </v>

551
00:30:46.221 --> 00:30:49.340
<v Speaker 1>of food and I started cooking in usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting things happened.</v>

552
00:30:49.341 --> 00:30:50.174
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

553
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant things don't happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but interesting things happen.</v>

554
00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 1>Interesting enough to write about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Evidently,</v>

555
00:30:56.111 --> 00:31:01.111
<v Speaker 1>since people read this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I don't really care.</v>

556
00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

557
00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:06.200
<v Speaker 1>if you substitute one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you,</v>

558
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.970
<v Speaker 1>if you are making pasta with Broccoli </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't have Broccoli,</v>

559
00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:13.220
<v Speaker 1>you want to make pasta with quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>flour.</v>

560
00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Everything about that is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cooking time,</v>

561
00:31:16.071 --> 00:31:16.904
<v Speaker 1>the technique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just about everything about it is the </v>

562
00:31:18.171 --> 00:31:19.004
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Assuming you know how to Trim Broccoli </v>

563
00:31:21.231 --> 00:31:24.230
<v Speaker 1>and trim quality flour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a different recipe?</v>

564
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:27.720
<v Speaker 1>You might say it's a different recipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

565
00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.440
<v Speaker 1>but almost everything about it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same and so wide.</v>

566
00:31:30.441 --> 00:31:32.150
<v Speaker 1>If it's a different recipe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recipes still good.</v>

567
00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:33.013
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to say you can vary things as </v>

568
00:31:36.111 --> 00:31:36.944
<v Speaker 1>much as you want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to remember that you can't </v>

569
00:31:38.421 --> 00:31:40.070
<v Speaker 1>make a roast chicken without chicken.</v>

570
00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:49.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a toss up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife is the greatest dining companion</v>

571
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:54.100
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

572
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:58.750
<v Speaker 1>a total joy to cook for and she's a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>eater and really have fun together.</v>

573
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:03.751
<v Speaker 1>But I have to say that my kids who grew </v>
<v Speaker 1>up eating my food and can call and say,</v>

574
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.673
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you make something Asian or I'm </v>

575
00:32:07.421 --> 00:32:09.520
<v Speaker 1>coming over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need this pasta dish,</v>

576
00:32:09.521 --> 00:32:12.610
<v Speaker 1>or I'm coming over and could you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we have one of those?</v>

577
00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:13.493
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

578
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.850
<v Speaker 1>it's really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean like they're grown.</v>

579
00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:20.710
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of history there and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>really special to cook for that.</v>

580
00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:24.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to have to convince anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>that what I'm making is good.</v>

581
00:32:24.711 --> 00:32:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I know it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I usually enjoy it.</v>

582
00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.960
<v Speaker 1>If someone enjoys eating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll enjoy eating this stuff.</v>

583
00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they don't,</v>

584
00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:33.800
<v Speaker 1>something's wrong somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

585
00:32:33.801 --> 00:32:35.710
<v Speaker 1>there's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

586
00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:36.673
<v Speaker 1>Julia child used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great thing about is you get to eat </v>

587
00:32:39.861 --> 00:32:40.790
<v Speaker 1>your mistakes.</v>

588
00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.013
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that if you take care and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking and if you know what you're </v>

589
00:32:44.841 --> 00:32:48.590
<v Speaker 1>doing even a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you burn something,</v>

590
00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.060
<v Speaker 1>there are very few things that wind up </v>
<v Speaker 1>so bad that you can enjoy them.</v>

591
00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Very few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

592
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

593
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:56.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

594
00:32:56.001 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lucky enough to have been doing this</v>

595
00:32:57.981 --> 00:32:58.814
<v Speaker 1>long enough and writing about it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning from other people and thinking </v>

596
00:33:01.221 --> 00:33:02.054
<v Speaker 1>about it so that generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff I do is pretty good and the </v>

597
00:33:05.451 --> 00:33:08.420
<v Speaker 1>people I cook for tend to enjoy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I said before,</v>

598
00:33:08.421 --> 00:33:09.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not brilliant.</v>

599
00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:12.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not earth shattering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just good food.</v>

600
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.333
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria and I have known each other </v>

601
00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:18.853
<v Speaker 1>probably 10 years and we've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly busy so we don't see each </v>

602
00:33:22.511 --> 00:33:23.344
<v Speaker 1>other that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was really a treat to hang out so </v>

603
00:33:25.811 --> 00:33:27.040
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

604
00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know from my,</v>

605
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the people who I was going to say my </v>
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>

606
00:33:32.921 --> 00:33:34.300
<v Speaker 1>which I guess is right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

607
00:33:34.301 --> 00:33:35.134
<v Speaker 1>I know from people who've watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending on the road again and my other </v>

608
00:33:37.721 --> 00:33:39.780
<v Speaker 1>TV shows that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

609
00:33:39.910 --> 00:33:40.743
<v Speaker 1>everybody thinks that TV is the most fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world and everybody's </v>

610
00:33:43.931 --> 00:33:46.360
<v Speaker 1>completely jealous of,</v>

611
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:48.413
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you got to hang out with Mario and </v>

612
00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:50.204
<v Speaker 1>Gwyneth and this has that beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and the food and Spain must be so </v>

613
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:53.624
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that television is a </v>

614
00:33:55.281 --> 00:33:56.114
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of work and for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute on screen there's an hour of </v>

615
00:34:01.851 --> 00:34:02.684
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for every 60 minutes on screen </v>

616
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:06.830
<v Speaker 1>there's a week of work and it really is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

617
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:07.664
<v Speaker 1>So we did huge amount of driving and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of setup time and not </v>

618
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 1>exactly rehearsal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but figuring out what we're going to do.</v>

619
00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.333
<v Speaker 1>So none of that was my favorite part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My favorite part was nighttime when </v>

620
00:34:19.611 --> 00:34:21.710
<v Speaker 1>everything was done and we all got drunk</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

621
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:22.544
<v Speaker 1>So that was really great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Mario's Mario of course can drink </v>

622
00:34:26.390 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 1>anyone under the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he'll admit to this.</v>

623
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not an admission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he'll be proud of this.</v>

624
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:35.900
<v Speaker 1>Whereas I can't drink anyway under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

625
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Plus I go to bed earlier than anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

626
00:34:38.361 --> 00:34:43.361
<v Speaker 1>I go to bed earlier than anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd finished the shoot.</v>

627
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:47.090
<v Speaker 1>We'd have a bite to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a fair amount of wine.</v>

628
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.490
<v Speaker 1>It would be 9:30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10:30,</v>

629
00:34:49.491 --> 00:34:51.260
<v Speaker 1>1130.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go to bed.</v>

630
00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Mario will be up until four in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>

631
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else was waking up with black </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes and broken shoulders.</v>

632
00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.660
<v Speaker 1>He was always in great shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was sort of fun.</v>

633
00:34:59.661 --> 00:35:04.650
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I could say,</v>

634
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would cook for Adolf Hitler and </v>

635
00:35:07.951 --> 00:35:09.750
<v Speaker 1>surfing poison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say that.</v>

636
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say quite sincerely.</v>

637
00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:15.203
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

638
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:17.933
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can influence people </v>

639
00:35:18.991 --> 00:35:19.621
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

640
00:35:19.621 --> 00:35:20.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

641
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:22.860
<v Speaker 1>the obvious answer and obvious answers I</v>
<v Speaker 1>will.</v>

642
00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I would cook for President Obama and set</v>
<v Speaker 1>him straight on a number of issues,</v>

643
00:35:26.971 --> 00:35:29.100
<v Speaker 1>but he's already got a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>setting them straight.</v>

644
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I think the people I'd most like to cook</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

645
00:35:32.830 --> 00:35:36.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be my maternal grandparents who</v>

646
00:35:36.181 --> 00:35:37.014
<v Speaker 1>I loved very much had been dead a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and who I think in some ways we're </v>

647
00:35:41.491 --> 00:35:46.491
<v Speaker 1>responsible a lot for my personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the way I handle myself and also for</v>

648
00:35:47.341 --> 00:35:48.174
<v Speaker 1>my love of food and saying that makes me</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I should go cook for my parents </v>

649
00:35:52.321 --> 00:35:55.440
<v Speaker 1>more often than I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're alive fortunately.</v>

650
00:35:55.441 --> 00:36:00.441
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to look on well Foodie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

651
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:06.680
<v Speaker 1>we should be hearing less about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>being foodies.</v>

652
00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:07.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I have to turn that question </v>

653
00:36:11.151 --> 00:36:11.984
<v Speaker 1>around and say I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just really wish that people would </v>

654
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:15.710
<v Speaker 1>take more responsibility for their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

655
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:18.500
<v Speaker 1>I wish people would buy their own food </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cook their own food.</v>

656
00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't wish restaurants didn't exist.</v>

657
00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.730
<v Speaker 1>I wish that people didn't eat 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their meals outside of the home.</v>

658
00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:28.250
<v Speaker 1>I wish they had 10 percent of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>meals outside of the home.</v>

659
00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.413
<v Speaker 1>That would be the most positive trend </v>
<v Speaker 1>that could possibly happen in food in </v>

660
00:36:31.881 --> 00:36:34.820
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I say eating at home,</v>

661
00:36:34.821 --> 00:36:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean going to the supermarket </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying some pre prepared food and eating</v>

662
00:36:39.321 --> 00:36:40.154
<v Speaker 1>it at home and I don't mean by microwave</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and reheating it and home and I </v>

663
00:36:43.611 --> 00:36:47.750
<v Speaker 1>don't mean calling for pizza or take out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eating at home and cooking.</v>

664
00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:48.913
<v Speaker 1>And if people cooked 50 percent of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>meals as opposed to what's probably 20 </v>

665
00:36:54.051 --> 00:36:56.010
<v Speaker 1>percent of their sales people really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cook,</v>

666
00:36:56.011 --> 00:36:56.844
<v Speaker 1>60 percent of the meals there would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge impact on both their health and on </v>

667
00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.310
<v Speaker 1>the environment and it would be almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely positive.</v>

668
00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:07.610
<v Speaker 1>That's really my most fervent wish.</v>
