00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Why is it the greatest challenge facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>both parties?</v>

2
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Fundamental change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can live in a lot of moments in</v>

3
00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>American history where the is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>born into and the world's you governor</v>

4
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>that vastly different and they're always</v>
<v Speaker 1>different 30 or 40 years past.</v>

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are gonna change in a country.</v>

6
00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:26.410
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that said,</v>

7
00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can there if you were,</v>

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>if you were born at a certain point in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century after,</v>

9
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

10
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.540
<v Speaker 1>after the Great Depression and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>governing in the 1960s or 1970s,</v>

11
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.183
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was,</v>

12
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>the economy was pretty much the economy</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was supposed to be.</v>

13
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>It was run by an industrial engine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world was still divvied up among</v>

14
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>states who did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:46.331 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>menaced each other only or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>sign treaties and didn't manage each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

17
00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world was pretty much the one.</v>

18
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.590
<v Speaker 1>You had telephones and you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>

19
00:00:53.591 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you had nicer televisions and you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable TV.</v>

20
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 1>But people were still communicating with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another and much the same way.</v>

21
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And they were still posting letters by</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand and sending them in a mailbox,</v>

22
00:01:02.021 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>and then you have a moment like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

24
00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

25
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.220
<v Speaker 1>where the world is just vastly different</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it was 30,</v>

26
00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:10.031
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in a sense,</v>

27
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>we're caught between moments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:14.830
<v Speaker 1>We're in between this industrial age and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comes next because we still have</v>

29
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 1>vestiges one foot in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vestiges of the past and one foot there</v>

30
00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and one foot in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the challenge for the Democratic</v>

31
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Party or any party has to lead the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that future is to articulate what,</v>

32
00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.450
<v Speaker 1>what government and the economic engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>and foreign policy of a country are</v>

33
00:01:28.451 --> 00:01:29.284
<v Speaker 1>going to look like.</v>

34
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the era where none of those things</v>

35
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>are operable anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the economy is nonindustrial</v>

36
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people communicate with each other</v>

37
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:37.240
<v Speaker 1>all over the world in a flash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

38
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.740
<v Speaker 1>where people expect to have options and</v>
<v Speaker 1>choices in their lives where the threats</v>

39
00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:42.241
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:44.860
<v Speaker 1>affect the world are not necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>states to states,</v>

41
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but a bunch of people who can</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate on the Internet and do a</v>

42
00:01:46.871 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>great deal more damage than a general in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some country.</v>

43
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:50.261
<v Speaker 1>Can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

44
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a whole new landscape and when</v>

45
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming around to the view that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>it's too much to ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just too much to ask of a</v>

47
00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.560
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>born into a different world to govern in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>

49
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>I think the baby boom generation has</v>
<v Speaker 1>done what it can.</v>

50
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

52
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't indict them as,</v>

53
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:08.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selfish,</v>

54
00:02:08.291 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>worthless people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's,</v>

55
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>it may have been just too much to ask a</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation born in the 1950s to figure</v>

56
00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>out how to govern in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the year 2007 or 2008.</v>

57
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

58
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming around to the view that</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership and real leadership and real</v>

59
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 1>change and real evolution of government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

60
00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:26.620
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to wait for another</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>
