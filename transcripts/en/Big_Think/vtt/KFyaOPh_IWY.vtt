1
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>That neurological process includes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sale as soon as,</v>

2
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a reaction at the level of the</v>

3
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>signups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

4
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>and this is serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>overreaction leads to a</v>

5
00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>changes in the connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The synopsis changes that include both</v>

6
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:34.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just say</v>

9
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>changes in the receptors are located.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The signups is such that these receptors</v>

10
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>respond in a different way and change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the release of neurotransmitter of the</v>

11
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>sign opsis and eventually changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

12
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of the morphology of the</v>

13
00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.413
<v Speaker 1>signups,</v>

14
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such debt.</v>

15
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>There was enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dick response becomes much,</v>

16
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>much stronger and even an addition to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that for this memory to last long,</v>

17
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.900
<v Speaker 1>there have to be changes in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 1>at the level of the genes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the top part of our DNA and,</v>

19
00:01:26.401 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are long lasting so that our</v>

20
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:35.211
<v Speaker 1>genetic changes with the formation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>new proteins in the cells that uh,</v>

21
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't live.</v>

22
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's a sign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

23
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.060
<v Speaker 1>it's changed in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over their eyes.</v>

24
00:01:50.061 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>It's plastic changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or like as far as more protein,</v>

25
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>a new proteins formed at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have the signups.</v>

26
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.260
<v Speaker 1>You say men wanting pass through similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes to save our point first year,</v>

27
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>memorize what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you consolidate this something that</v>

28
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>you can recall it when you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember.</v>

29
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.140
<v Speaker 1>Then you can reconsolidate it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>process which has several</v>

30
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.300
<v Speaker 1>steps are phases.</v>

31
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>I bet that it depends on the particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment in which you are trying to recall</v>

32
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>that memory on certain processes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>no longer happen in the brain or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>are blocked,</v>

34
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.500
<v Speaker 1>some chemical reaction occur and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>interfere or did not occur and interfere</v>

35
00:02:46.191 --> 00:02:49.040
<v Speaker 1>with this process of recalling in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain moment.</v>

36
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>two shown some data still remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because you make an association</v>

39
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.190
<v Speaker 1>something in that moment that the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

40
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.110
<v Speaker 1>so if you associate something with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular older,</v>

42
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>I make an example and then the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

43
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>then the memory comes up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just those options.</v>

44
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.320
<v Speaker 1>It's also to remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

45
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:24.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I bet that smell is much more</v>

46
00:03:25.231 --> 00:03:27.510
<v Speaker 1>important for a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then few months,</v>

47
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.140
<v Speaker 1>although there are humans or exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>their sense of this male and afforded a</v>

48
00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.770
<v Speaker 1>probably much better than I am now.</v>

49
00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is differences between St Louis a</v>

50
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.050
<v Speaker 1>way of learning according to the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not the same.</v>

51
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a door that send people a is</v>

52
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 1>more open one door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then another sword or so they use it one</v>

53
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>particular way more than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are differences.</v>

54
00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:03.291
<v Speaker 1>But if we accept to the way in which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>memory gets in the chemical process that</v>

55
00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.010
<v Speaker 1>once this thing is getting that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

56
00:04:08.011 --> 00:04:10.590
<v Speaker 1>very similar inside of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are very,</v>

57
00:04:10.591 --> 00:04:13.440
<v Speaker 1>very similar for different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call input of memory coming from</v>

59
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.420
<v Speaker 1>different ways through different</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms.</v>

60
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And they're very similar in humans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very similar in between the</v>

61
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>different animals.</v>
