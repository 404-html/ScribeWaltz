00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.093
<v Speaker 2>what's changing is the idea that um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elections are controlled by a small </v>

3
00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:24.351
<v Speaker 2>group of professional campaigners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consultants and,</v>

4
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundraisers and pollsters and the,</v>

6
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 2>the big media people who kind of write </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

7
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.503
<v Speaker 2>the frame that's all being opened up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what we experienced in the United </v>

8
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 2>States was the first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:44.700
<v Speaker 2>what I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mass participation election.</v>

10
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.773
<v Speaker 2>Literally millions of people waking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>every day and being involved in the </v>

11
00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:51.714
<v Speaker 2>election way before election day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mobilizing their friends in organizing </v>

12
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.893
<v Speaker 2>events,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in doing their own micro fundraisers in </v>

13
00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.740
<v Speaker 2>creating their own messages and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading them online.</v>

14
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

15
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:12.081
<v Speaker 2>that is a new dynamic when you have out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a country with maybe 120,</v>

16
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 million voters,</v>

17
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 2>10 or $20 million of them that actively </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved.</v>

18
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.923
<v Speaker 2>It definitely changes the dynamic of </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and the world that politicians </v>

19
00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.840
<v Speaker 2>have to operate in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the big.</v>
