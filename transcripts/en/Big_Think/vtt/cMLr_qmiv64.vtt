1
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my suspicion is that people are not</v>

2
00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.970
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in all cases,</v>

3
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:17.120
<v Speaker 1>more motivated by economic concerns than</v>
<v Speaker 1>other concerns.</v>

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 1>What I suspect is that people think they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to talk in economic terms.</v>

5
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.200
<v Speaker 1>They have to provide economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>justifications for things that they</v>

6
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:30.350
<v Speaker 1>actually want to do for other sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerations.</v>

7
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.840
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just give you a few examples of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

8
00:00:32.841 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 1>They're really a grab bag of examples of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

9
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 1>People did not go into the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately to overthrow communism in</v>

10
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 1>1989 in eastern Europe because they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>some kind of benefit cost analysis and</v>

11
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>decided that the risk of being run over</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a Soviet tank with somehow less than</v>

12
00:00:53.541 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>the benefit they might gain if there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transition to a capitalist economy.</v>

13
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did this out of a,</v>

14
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.720
<v Speaker 1>out of a sense of idealism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a sense of the dignity of a,</v>

15
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>of individual people that was being</v>
<v Speaker 1>trampled in these kinds of societies and</v>

16
00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>out of a vision of what a better world</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be.</v>

17
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.320
<v Speaker 1>They didn't do it in economic terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>similarly today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last decade in American society,</v>

19
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>there are people who favor a policy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I very much disagree with,</v>

20
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>that's known as the war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war on drugs is not an economically</v>

21
00:01:27.651 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>rational policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even people who support the war on</v>

22
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.980
<v Speaker 1>drugs would not argue for it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic grounds.</v>

23
00:01:33.981 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>They argue for it on moral grounds that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong for people to take drugs.</v>

24
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong for society to send a message</v>
<v Speaker 1>that says that it's okay to do that.</v>

25
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 1>So I think generally we do still often</v>
<v Speaker 1>act out of non economic motives.</v>

26
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just that like those people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>16th century,</v>

27
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 1>somehow we think we need to defend those</v>
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>

28
00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Now on the basis of economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then on the basis of religion,</v>

29
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the hopeful signs is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Obama is beginning to bring</v>

30
00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>back a richer and fuller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately what I think is a more</v>

31
00:02:09.291 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>realistic and more human kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric to our political debates.</v>

32
00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>There are many issues in American public</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that,</v>

33
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 1>that divide people and interesting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhat unpredictable way.</v>

34
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:26.200
<v Speaker 1>So there are people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often people associated with the</v>

35
00:02:26.201 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 1>political right who say that we should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should only do things that make</v>

36
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>sense economically and what is all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonsense that environmentalist want to</v>

37
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>do to lock up wilderness areas and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

38
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.400
<v Speaker 1>But then when it comes to issues like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlying drugs outlawing abortion range</v>

39
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:45.220
<v Speaker 1>of other issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the ones who are taking moral</v>

40
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:48.610
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not taking hardheaded sort of</v>

41
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>libertarian a positions based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic realities.</v>

42
00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>None of us are rational economic man as</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to be portrayed in</v>

43
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were mixes of passions,</v>

44
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.210
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of desires,</v>

45
00:03:03.211 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>of a moral principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

46
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 1>of self,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deception,</v>

47
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>of altruism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of concern for others,</v>

48
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>concerned for ourselves and an interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our bank.</v>

49
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Accounts and social policies have to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsive to the complexity of who we</v>

50
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>are as people or else like the war on</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

51
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>They're simply going to fail.</v>

52
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.240
<v Speaker 1>I think one reason we fetishize</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics is because we have come to</v>

53
00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:34.701
<v Speaker 1>think that it is essentially connected</v>
<v Speaker 1>to wellbeing about what it is to have a</v>

54
00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:38.280
<v Speaker 1>good life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

55
00:03:38.281 --> 00:03:42.090
<v Speaker 1>there's very little psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for this being a very strong</v>

56
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.720
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the work psychologists</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done with the individual reports of</v>

58
00:03:48.721 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 1>wellbeing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that if you're poor,</v>

59
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.410
<v Speaker 1>you are not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you achieve a certain level of</v>

60
00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>material satisfaction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>then income has very little correlation</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people's report.</v>

62
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:05.130
<v Speaker 1>It states of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like climate matter,</v>

63
00:04:05.131 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>more things like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culture of the country in which</v>

64
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>you're raised matter more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so two things really,</v>

65
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like individual temperament matter,</v>

66
00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>matter more than these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once we see that economics is to a</v>

67
00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>very great extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detached from what it is that really</v>

68
00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>give us quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be a very liberating sort of</v>

69
00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>insight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.640
<v Speaker 1>because what that means is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

71
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>this sound very unpopular at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

72
00:04:36.601 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>but an economic downturn with all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>damage and real damage that,</v>

73
00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:46.551
<v Speaker 1>that creates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may not make us as unhappy as we might</v>

74
00:04:47.281 --> 00:04:48.114
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

75
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And indeed it might create opportunities</v>
<v Speaker 1>for new ways of life,</v>

76
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.180
<v Speaker 1>for new forms of happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for new ideas of quality of life that we</v>

77
00:04:57.181 --> 00:05:00.590
<v Speaker 1>simply would not have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>when we were in the world of getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>richer and richer and richer and richer</v>

79
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>without any reflection whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

80
00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.700
<v Speaker 1>the Millennium Development Goals are</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

81
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.880
<v Speaker 1>both morally and economically because</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the world's population maybe as</v>

82
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.270
<v Speaker 1>much as a third of the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

83
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 1>hasn't yet reached the level of economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>development where we began to get a</v>

84
00:05:27.061 --> 00:05:32.061
<v Speaker 1>dissociation from people's economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>status and their reports about personal</v>

85
00:05:32.371 --> 00:05:35.970
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we really do need to do much more and</v>

86
00:05:35.971 --> 00:05:40.971
<v Speaker 1>much more effectively in order to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone the kind of basis for for which</v>

87
00:05:41.851 --> 00:05:42.900
<v Speaker 1>they can have good lives.</v>
