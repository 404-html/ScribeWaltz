1
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.820
<v Speaker 1>The idea was</v>
<v Speaker 1>solving social problems</v>

2
00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 2>is different than solving business</v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 2>It takes strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes research,</v>

4
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 2>it takes careful analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also takes a different set of</v>

5
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 2>tools and we saw a lot of terrific tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>being developed in the business context</v>

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 2>to make companies competitive and</v>
<v Speaker 2>profitable and successful.</v>

7
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 2>We didn't see a similar set of tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>being as widely developed in the</v>

8
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:39.050
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit sector and so we wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>create a firm that brought the same kind</v>

9
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:44.051
<v Speaker 2>of analysis and strategy and reasoning</v>
<v Speaker 2>and research into solving social issues</v>

10
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 2>for foundations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for nonprofits and for corporations.</v>

11
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.690
<v Speaker 2>We often deal with funders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charitable funders,</v>

12
00:00:50.691 --> 00:00:54.170
<v Speaker 2>whether it's foundations or private</v>
<v Speaker 2>foundations or corporate foundations or</v>

13
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 2>even individual philanthropists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the first barriers is the</v>

14
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 2>fact that people don't really expect to</v>
<v Speaker 2>solve social problems through their</v>

15
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>philanthropy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would like to pick a good cause,</v>

16
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 2>a worthy organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give that organization money and that's</v>

17
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>a great thing to do.</v>

18
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 2>But there's a real problem with our</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit sector today in this country.</v>

19
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the most vibrant,</v>

20
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 2>most creative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>largest nonprofit sector in the world.</v>

21
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 2>And yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at where the United States</v>

22
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 2>stands on social issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on things like education,</v>

23
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 2>things like healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like the environment,</v>

24
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 2>we're at the bottom of the list of</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed countries.</v>

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 2>So somehow on the one hand we have this</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful nonprofit sector and on the</v>

26
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not solving the problems that the</v>

27
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:42.230
<v Speaker 2>nonprofit sector is supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving.</v>

28
00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>So there's a real basic problem there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we believe the problem really has to</v>

29
00:01:47.301 --> 00:01:52.301
<v Speaker 2>do with the behavior of donors that</v>
<v Speaker 2>donors are not expecting or demanding</v>

30
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They aren't being realistic and</v>

31
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 2>strategic in their giving to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>try and solve the problem.</v>

32
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 2>And without that incentive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nonprofits respond to the way donors</v>

33
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>think currently rather than focus in on</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can they actually achieve a</v>

34
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:12.560
<v Speaker 2>meaningful impact on</v>

35
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.760
<v Speaker 2>the organization that they should</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose.</v>

36
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

37
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 2>I guess the best way to think about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

38
00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 2>we did a very interesting engagement for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gates foundation and they came to us</v>

39
00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 2>and they said we'd like to help</v>
<v Speaker 2>encourage more effective philanthropy.</v>

40
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.030
<v Speaker 2>Not more money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but more effective practices,</v>

41
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 2>but we're not really sure what that</v>
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>

42
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.610
<v Speaker 2>So what does it mean to be effective in</v>
<v Speaker 2>philanthropy?</v>

43
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 2>And so they asked us to go out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>interview a couple dozen donors,</v>

44
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.680
<v Speaker 2>high net worth donors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who give away at least a million</v>

45
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 2>dollars a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people who are perceived as being</v>

46
00:02:54.261 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 2>highly effective in their philanthropy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be honest,</v>

47
00:02:57.891 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 2>we didn't think this engagement going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>work because we were talking to all</v>

48
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:02.310
<v Speaker 2>kinds of donors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

49
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:03.131
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>
<v Speaker 2>women,</v>

50
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:03.911
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

51
00:03:03.911 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 2>inherited wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate,</v>

52
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>new technology all across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we actually found something very</v>

53
00:03:09.191 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 2>interesting that all of these donors</v>
<v Speaker 2>came into philanthropy.</v>

54
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 2>They were responding to requests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were being a good citizen.</v>

55
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 2>They didn't really see any impact for</v>
<v Speaker 2>their money.</v>

56
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 2>They could give away millions of dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and nothing seemed to change and they</v>

57
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:27.781
<v Speaker 2>were kind of discouraged and at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>point they came across an issue that had</v>

58
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>real urgency and real personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>significance to them.</v>

59
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 2>So in one case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone son had a rare brain disease and</v>

60
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 2>there wasn't much research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In another case,</v>

61
00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>there was a beautiful theater downtown</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was going to be torn down as a</v>

62
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happened was they stopped</v>

63
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 2>thinking about how do I give away money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they started thinking about how do I</v>

64
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:53.161
<v Speaker 2>solve a specific problem and it changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely how they went about things.</v>

65
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 2>So instead of saying which charity do I</v>
<v Speaker 2>write a check to or so on,</v>

66
00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 2>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would have to happen for this</v>

67
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:05.161
<v Speaker 2>problem to be solved and how can we take</v>
<v Speaker 2>responsibility for making those things</v>

68
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 2>happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's really this problem solving</v>

69
00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 2>approach to philanthropy that we see as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the core difference between effective</v>

70
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:18.721
<v Speaker 2>philanthropists and most of the very</v>
<v Speaker 2>well meaning well intentioned people out</v>

71
00:04:18.731 --> 00:04:21.270
<v Speaker 2>there who given away a lot of money but</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't really seeing.</v>
