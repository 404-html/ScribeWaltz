1
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2
00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple of very important</v>

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>dimensions to consider here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't seen a lot of,</v>

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>of change in public opinion about</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change.</v>

5
00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.870
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>in part because of the downturn in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy where we're at,</v>

8
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an Arab in terms of public enthusiasm,</v>

10
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for action on climate change and concern</v>

11
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>over climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>and that's somewhat part of a natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle that you see on,</v>

13
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>on social problems generally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on environmental problems sort of at</v>

14
00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the height of concern about climate</v>
<v Speaker 1>change was around 2007,</v>

15
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the release of income,</v>

16
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient truth in a record amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

17
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>of news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to that issue.</v>

18
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>But it's almost as if the public became</v>
<v Speaker 1>a habituated or use or desensitized to a</v>

19
00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>lot of the stories and the narratives</v>
<v Speaker 1>about environmental impacts and</v>

20
00:00:53.941 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 1>environmental disaster that we're at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>really strongly featured a around that</v>

21
00:00:58.441 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

22
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.371
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with the performance of the economy,</v>

24
00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started moving into a downward cycle</v>

25
00:01:04.441 --> 00:01:07.200
<v Speaker 1>of concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the oil spill hasn't really changed</v>

26
00:01:07.201 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>or shifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

28
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.530
<v Speaker 1>that period that we're in right now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of an issue or a issue fatigue</v>

29
00:01:13.531 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

30
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with climate change.</v>

31
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>But what we have seen is a major change</v>
<v Speaker 1>in public opinion when it comes to</v>

32
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>asking the public about weighing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>importance of either economic growth or,</v>

33
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>or energy or exploration with the need</v>
<v Speaker 1>for environmental protection or</v>

34
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:30.800
<v Speaker 1>conservation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

35
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

36
00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the month before,</v>

37
00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 1>according to Gallup polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the month before the oil spill.</v>

38
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And then roughly a month and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

39
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>we saw that a majority of the public</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally reversed course that,</v>

40
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that before the oil spill,</v>

41
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:50.160
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the public favored</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy exploration on economic</v>

42
00:01:50.161 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>development over environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>protection.</v>

43
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six weeks later that public preference</v>

44
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>had flipped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's something that's been</v>

45
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>overlooked in the discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of blame on the</v>

46
00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>administration and on environmental</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups for not taking advantage of this</v>

47
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>major focusing event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in fact,</v>

48
00:02:06.871 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>I think there has been a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

49
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>The news attention has done the work for</v>
<v Speaker 1>an environmental groups and has opened</v>

50
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 1>up an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least a latent sentiment to think</v>

51
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>about environmental protection over</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth.</v>

52
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Even in this period of economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>recession.</v>
