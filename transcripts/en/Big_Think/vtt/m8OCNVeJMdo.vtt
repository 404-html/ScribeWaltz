1
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the interesting things about</v>

2
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>urban culture the last half century is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that urban residents are increasingly</v>

3
00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>college educated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart people with a lot of cultural</v>

4
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

5
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:31.121
<v Speaker 1>might not have a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have had fairly good jobs and a</v>

6
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:36.881
<v Speaker 1>terrific interest in history and art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we could call the aesthetics of</v>

7
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>city life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this made them look forward,</v>

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of cities and the areas in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities that had the cobblestone streets,</v>

9
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>red brick or brownstone or graystone</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses,</v>

10
00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>and a small stores that could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>converted to the interesting quality of</v>

11
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 1>life that they sought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very different from their</v>

12
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:13.151
<v Speaker 1>parents' generation in the fifties or</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties of the last century because</v>

13
00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>those people often try to escape urban</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

14
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>which they saw as closed in and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

15
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.160
<v Speaker 1>tenements and crowded streets and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing monolithic office towers for</v>

16
00:01:27.111 --> 00:01:30.440
<v Speaker 1>the suburbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of those people of the parents'</v>

17
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 1>generation left the cities because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought the cities,</v>

18
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be poor and degraded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's their children who have</v>

19
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:44.351
<v Speaker 1>returned to cities who have confirmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interest of city life.</v>

20
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>But the more of them or of us who come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to cities for the less space there is</v>

21
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>for the low income people who have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>living in cities all along.</v>

22
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>So it's a curious kind of culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>develops out of great appreciation for</v>

23
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:08.021
<v Speaker 1>the authentic city that has been here</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a a tendency to impose new tastes</v>

24
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.720
<v Speaker 1>that drive out longtime residents and</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

25
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>The idea of authenticity really comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Shakespeare's time and Russo's</v>

26
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A century later when,</v>

27
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people began to realize that,</v>

28
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

29
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:38.311
<v Speaker 1>there is such a thing as an authentic</v>
<v Speaker 1>self that could thrive in a natural or</v>

30
00:02:39.491 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 1>an authentic society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

31
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.970
<v Speaker 1>there haven't been too many completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>authentic societies,</v>

32
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.240
<v Speaker 1>but from the 17th and 18th centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some groups of people have tried to</v>

33
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>absent themselves from society to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rural commune,</v>

34
00:02:56.921 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to found the utopia and sometimes even</v>

35
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>to come to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a working class neighborhood to live</v>

36
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:10.081
<v Speaker 1>among people and live in surroundings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they think will allow them to</v>

37
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>create an authentic self.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are people who don't look for</v>

38
00:03:15.851 --> 00:03:20.851
<v Speaker 1>certain kinds of fashions to demonstrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>their identity and they don't</v>

39
00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>necessarily join political groups or</v>
<v Speaker 1>social movements,</v>

40
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but they tried to live in a space that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can identify with as,</v>

41
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an authentic space and an authentic</v>

42
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:34.324
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

43
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's neighborhoods like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:03:36.581 --> 00:03:41.581
<v Speaker 1>Bohemian districts of Paris in the late</v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century or Greenwich village,</v>

45
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>a Bohemian district of New York in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>early 20th century.</v>

46
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.770
<v Speaker 1>But when those areas become two</v>
<v Speaker 1>conformist or too expensive,</v>

47
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.070
<v Speaker 1>those who seek an authentic life move</v>
<v Speaker 1>elsewhere so that the center of artistic</v>

48
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.310
<v Speaker 1>authenticity in New York moved from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greenwich village to Brooklyn Heights in</v>

49
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 1>the mid 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also by the 1960s to the East</v>

50
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was not called the East village</v>

51
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was part of the lower east side.</v>

52
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.630
<v Speaker 1>But I guess an enterprising real estate</v>
<v Speaker 1>agent or developer said,</v>

53
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>there are so many hippies living here</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for,</v>

54
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some kind of commune in the city</v>

55
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:29.100
<v Speaker 1>that I'll benefit by calling this area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:33.910
<v Speaker 1>the East village and connected with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>old bohemianism of Greenwich Village.</v>

57
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And then by the 1990s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the East village became very expensive,</v>

58
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>partly because of the university</v>
<v Speaker 1>expansion nearby and partly because of</v>

59
00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:47.160
<v Speaker 1>the attractiveness of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.390
<v Speaker 1>some of the hippie and art destinations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been created during the 1980s.</v>

62
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>So the center of authenticity then moved</v>
<v Speaker 1>across the East River on the,</v>

63
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the subway to Williamsburg,</v>

64
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.740
<v Speaker 1>which then became a district of indie</v>
<v Speaker 1>music bands and bars and kind of edgy</v>

65
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:11.200
<v Speaker 1>performance spaces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

66
00:05:11.201 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>this of course is a young sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>authenticity.</v>

67
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:18.850
<v Speaker 1>It's different from the gentrification</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a more settled,</v>

68
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>slightly older population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

69
00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

70
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>as rents go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

71
00:05:25.811 --> 00:05:30.811
<v Speaker 1>the search for authenticity expands</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for other areas of the city that</v>

72
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>offer a kind of low down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but truer sense of where the self can</v>

73
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>develop.</v>
