1
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.880
<v Speaker 1>I think key to Improv is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to embracing it's positivity,</v>

2
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>it's hearing things and not shutting</v>
<v Speaker 1>them down.</v>

3
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 1>It's trying to find ways to make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and I think in the business world,</v>

4
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that's very valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that it's very frustrating to</v>

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>be told no all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv really revolves around the idea</v>

6
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>of like whatever you come at me with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say yes to it.</v>

7
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>That's our reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to work.</v>

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's start there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just the idea of saying yes to each</v>

9
00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not shutting down ideas,</v>

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.130
<v Speaker 1>seeing if there's ways to make ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>workable,</v>

11
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>making that your default setting of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

12
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:35.760
<v Speaker 1>I really want to respect what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

13
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>See if there's a way to take it</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere else versus here's all the</v>

14
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>things that are wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think it's just a very positive</v>

15
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>mentality.</v>

16
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.840
<v Speaker 1>So I think a lot of people that come</v>
<v Speaker 1>across it get very addicted to it</v>

17
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>because it does feel different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially as a New Yorker.</v>

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.870
<v Speaker 1>We're just used to a world where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's kind of grumpy all the time</v>

19
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>and moving fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to deal with each other.</v>

20
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>The idea of showing any emotion in</v>
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

21
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.100
<v Speaker 1>not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of slowing down to deal with</v>

22
00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>someone else's ideas and emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Good.</v>

23
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>Like we're New Yorkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to get where we're going.</v>

24
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>So I think Improv really looks at a side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of life that's like,</v>

25
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if we let all that go for a little</v>

26
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:13.830
<v Speaker 1>while and just really work on sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>positively embracing each other's ideas</v>

27
00:01:13.831 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

28
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and really listening hard to what other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to say.</v>

29
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So it's a pretty beautiful thing when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going right.</v>

30
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Very often what you'll see happen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>improv classes when people get nervous</v>

31
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>about how it's going is they'll start</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

32
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

33
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.303
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.100
<v Speaker 1>when dad gets home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to be really mad.</v>

35
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Or they'll say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

36
00:01:33.511 --> 00:01:36.870
<v Speaker 1>when we get to reno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff's really going to hit the fan.</v>

37
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:37.980
<v Speaker 1>And they start saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

38
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>this thing that's going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or this thing,</v>

39
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember when you did that thing back</v>

40
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really mad about it.</v>

41
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.770
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening is that it's always at it's</v>

42
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>most powerful when it's present,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's right here,</v>

43
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>when it's right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been a lesson about Improv</v>

44
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>that I think just made me a much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>social person.</v>

45
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Like it just made me like when I would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go have pitch meetings,</v>

46
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I was just able to have it better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in my personal life,</v>

47
00:02:02.161 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>like I was just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got when I,</v>

48
00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>when I started really thinking hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these improv lessons,</v>

49
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>not to get weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like my dating life just got so much</v>

50
00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:12.330
<v Speaker 1>better because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing I always stress that I think</v>

51
00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>apply just any conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always ask people to answer these</v>

52
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>three questions when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvising.</v>

53
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Why these people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why right here,</v>

54
00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>why right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always just drill that why these</v>

55
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why right here,</v>

56
00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>why right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meaning if you're not just.</v>

57
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.780
<v Speaker 1>If you're in a scene and there's two</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and you're talking about people</v>

58
00:02:30.781 --> 00:02:34.110
<v Speaker 1>who aren't here like they're not here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably aren't the most</v>

59
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:35.940
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing for an audience to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear about.</v>

60
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>If you're talking about a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>location than the scene,</v>

61
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.690
<v Speaker 1>the scenes taking place in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why isn't the scene unfolding</v>

62
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds more interesting.</v>

63
00:02:43.951 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Why are you teasing an audience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So and another thing too,</v>

64
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.510
<v Speaker 1>people will often go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

65
00:02:48.511 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>you'll never believe what's inside this</v>
<v Speaker 1>briefcase.</v>

66
00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's invisible.</v>

67
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's just talk to each other us things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find common ground,</v>

68
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>whether that's positive things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagreements we might actually have.</v>

69
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Why are these people in this location at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time?</v>

70
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't this the scene where choosing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show the audience so the more we can</v>

71
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>just make things present between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people right there,</v>

72
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>the less the audience has to suspend</v>
<v Speaker 1>their disbelief and imagine the better</v>

73
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>the listening is going to be and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder it's going to hit.</v>

74
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>And what we find when that happens in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improv is your simple choices can</v>

75
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:28.171
<v Speaker 1>actually get huge reactions because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I were doing a scene and I came</v>

76
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>at you and start at the scene by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

77
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>like everything that happened in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can never talk about it again.</v>

78
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like it has really high</v>
<v Speaker 1>stakes,</v>

79
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:41.680
<v Speaker 1>but now the audience has to figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what happened in Canada and why are</v>

80
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>we all scared of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I just looked at you and</v>

81
00:03:43.811 --> 00:03:44.644
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

82
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm so scared and I need you to help me</v>
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

83
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a more vague thing with</v>
<v Speaker 1>less comedic potential,</v>

84
00:03:53.261 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>but an audience that they're scared and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to help each other.</v>

85
00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they scared?</v>

86
00:03:57.281 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 1>They're scared right now and they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help each other.</v>

87
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a human connection that we can</v>

88
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>latch onto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so being present in the moment with each</v>

89
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else you're going to work out.</v>

90
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make your improv scene so much better.</v>

91
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I feel it makes a lot of conversations</v>
<v Speaker 1>better to.</v>

92
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm a really big fan lately of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>phrase slow as slow,</v>

93
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>as fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slow as fast,</v>

94
00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.610
<v Speaker 1>and what I mean by that is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the context I can,</v>

95
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I can speak to it in the context of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who</v>

96
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like we forget that when we're</v>

97
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>on stage and we're improvising and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>bouncing ideas back and forth and</v>

98
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard for them to keep up and</v>

99
00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:37.660
<v Speaker 1>they don't really know why we're making</v>
<v Speaker 1>the choices we're making because we're</v>

100
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>trained in this and we have classes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this so we can go.</v>

101
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To them it looks like it's moving a</v>

102
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>million miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most people when they see an Improv</v>

103
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.681
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they like it,</v>

104
00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>they remember that first one is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the best show they ever saw and it</v>

105
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:53.710
<v Speaker 1>probably wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably just that these people</v>

106
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:55.000
<v Speaker 1>knew what they were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much.</v>

107
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I always like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress about slowing down,</v>

108
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.550
<v Speaker 1>slowing down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowing down is this idea.</v>

109
00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>It's actually something that I learned</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my wife uses this phrase because</v>

110
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>she is an aerialist shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her,</v>

111
00:05:06.611 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>she was an aerialist for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was a dancer who would do all this</v>

112
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>work with harnesses and rigging and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying around from the ceiling and she</v>

113
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>told me that phrase and it's stuck in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>head because she always said like,</v>

114
00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>if you have a problem with your harness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get it fixed fast so you can</v>

115
00:05:18.761 --> 00:05:21.520
<v Speaker 1>go back to the the act you want to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in there.</v>

116
00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>But remember to the people watching like</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how long it takes,</v>

117
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>no matter how slowly move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still flying around in the sky.</v>

118
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And I think for Improv that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>applies well.</v>

119
00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:33.970
<v Speaker 1>If like no matter how we can really take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a breath,</v>

120
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the audience is going to be blown away</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we do our jobs right.</v>

121
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.540
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to move fast to impress</v>
<v Speaker 1>them like the,</v>

122
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>the desires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just joke,</v>

123
00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:42.521
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

124
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:43.001
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh,</v>

125
00:05:43.001 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>laugh at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can smother it.</v>

126
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.630
<v Speaker 1>So another thing I often say about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>too is like we have to remember when</v>

127
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 1>we're improvising that like it's sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like building a fire,</v>

128
00:05:51.521 --> 00:05:55.000
<v Speaker 1>like you have to start with the kindle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have to start with just a spark</v>

129
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>and you can't just throw the big logs</v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

130
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>If you just try to pile everything on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to go anywhere.</v>

131
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>The audience is going to smell a rat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be with it.</v>

132
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the advice I can give anyone is</v>

133
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.910
<v Speaker 1>just remember someone who is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional doing what they do at any</v>

134
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.860
<v Speaker 1>speed is probably going to blow away and</v>
<v Speaker 1>novice.</v>

135
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>They're probably going to have total</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

136
00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 1>And when we rush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually can give that away.</v>

137
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>I think when we consciously take a</v>
<v Speaker 1>breath and slow down at demonstrates</v>

138
00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>like confidence and mastery of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>craft,</v>

139
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>which I know is a very pretentious thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

140
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>but that's what I used to say to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I taught them in their improv</v>

141
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>acting classes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can be kind of pretentious.</v>

142
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:35.540
<v Speaker 1>So that's the main thing is remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do is impressive.</v>

143
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.570
<v Speaker 1>We don't need to speed through it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to be blown away</v>

144
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 1>as long as we do it with integrity.</v>
