00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>What catches my eye is</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly feel that I am most touched by</v>

2
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.740
<v Speaker 1>work that has some sort of connection to</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature.</v>

3
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>It is about the biomorphic even</v>
<v Speaker 1>zoomorphic if you want to be fanciful</v>

4
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>tendencies of a certain piece and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

5
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

6
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:34.510
<v Speaker 1>and I've always found that I am a less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a hardcore modernist and more of an</v>

7
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>organic surrealist modernist in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own taste and my own passion and what</v>

8
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>I go for and when I'm trying to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>new areas of a market with,</v>

9
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.920
<v Speaker 1>with my team when we're kind of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:51.340
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Danish cabinet maker or Moose,</v>

11
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.190
<v Speaker 1>there's only been two of his works to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever appear in America.</v>

12
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be great to like talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some folks and see if we can find more</v>

13
00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 1>of his work and bring it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always seems to fall into that</v>

14
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>organic kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.810
<v Speaker 1>aura for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>you definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine</v>

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.590
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>
