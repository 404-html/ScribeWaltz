1
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

2
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole lot of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75 percent of medical costs stem from</v>

3
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:12.150
<v Speaker 1>behavioral and cultural issues over</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating,</v>

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>eating too much corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking,</v>

5
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>lack of exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basics,</v>

6
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>the absolute basics are causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous cost in the system and</v>

7
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>tremendous misery among the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have these conditions,</v>

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>helping people understand their role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own health,</v>

9
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>helping people move through a mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>space where they actually participate in</v>

10
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>making their health better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ends up producing costs for their</v>

11
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their insurance companies is what we</v>

12
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>need to use this technology to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people might respond to the</v>

13
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 1>ability to earn money by keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself healthy.</v>

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.910
<v Speaker 1>But some people might not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people might only respond to other</v>

15
00:00:50.911 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>motivations like losing money or social</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure or</v>

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>entertainment or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being in the know,</v>

18
00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:03.630
<v Speaker 1>being helpful to others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you give someone an opportunity to be</v>

19
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>helpful to others with your condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see their health improved</v>

20
00:01:06.841 --> 00:01:09.030
<v Speaker 1>dramatically for some personality types.</v>

21
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>And our last company tickle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had 100 million registered users.</v>

22
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>20 billion questions answered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had five phds on staff or on the</v>

23
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:20.280
<v Speaker 1>psychology of your personality and were</v>
<v Speaker 1>you working on sort of taking that,</v>

24
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that understanding about human</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations and creating a set of</v>

25
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:29.270
<v Speaker 1>experiences which address the seven or</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight main motivation types which apply</v>

26
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 1>to seven or eight different personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>types,</v>

27
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>is gonna start to deepen our ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help people move through behavioral</v>

28
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:40.791
<v Speaker 1>changes they need to make to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>change their health and the costs of,</v>

29
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>of their health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of maintaining their health.</v>

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the things that we're</v>

31
00:01:45.631 --> 00:01:48.580
<v Speaker 1>trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

32
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>the main costs come from diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart disease,</v>

33
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>obesity and asthma and allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the sort of main low hanging</v>

34
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>fruits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where if you look at where your</v>

35
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>costs are coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where they're coming from.</v>

36
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes is an epidemic in this kind of</v>

37
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>88 percent of people have diabetes at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

38
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.893
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

39
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 1>that's a major cost center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

40
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going after those diseases with these</v>

41
00:02:13.081 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>new methodologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.340
<v Speaker 1>we've tried a disease management in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>

43
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Speaker 1>but it's generally been only going after</v>
<v Speaker 1>one personality type,</v>

44
00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>which is a nurse calls you twice a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>to berate you into maintaining your</v>

45
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That works for some people but only</v>

46
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>works for one personality type.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to apply many more tools to</v>

47
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:36.150
<v Speaker 1>getting people to change their behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need to deploy them in a much</v>

48
00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>more cost effective way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which having an expensive nurse called</v>

49
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>twice a week to the whole population is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty expensive way to do it.</v>

50
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so those are models that have</v>

51
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 1>failed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are many more models to try</v>

52
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.280
<v Speaker 1>and some of them are going to work over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next five or 10 years.</v>

53
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And so that's what Med ped is as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>platform for trying out all these</v>

54
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>different ideas and then capturing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>stats about what's working and then</v>

55
00:02:57.981 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>iterating on that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and focusing people on the things that</v>

56
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>are actually working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidenced based,</v>

57
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>sort of behavioral change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

58
00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:05.761
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

59
00:03:05.761 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another,</v>

60
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>another big cost center is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdiagnosis.</v>

61
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>So in your local area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a physician</v>

62
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:19.250
<v Speaker 1>diagnose you and they may or may or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may or may not have the uptodate</v>

63
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.360
<v Speaker 1>information about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to diagnose someone with these</v>

64
00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>sayings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's estimated that up to upwards of 40</v>

65
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>percent of serious cancer cases are</v>
<v Speaker 1>misdiagnosed.</v>

66
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Not that you don't have lung cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just what type of lung cancer and</v>

67
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the stage you're at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be misdiagnosed,</v>

68
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.500
<v Speaker 1>which causes you to have the wrong drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the wrong program for taking those</v>

69
00:03:40.601 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>drugs at the wrong treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's 40 percent,</v>

70
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 1>that's an incredible cost to the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be misdiagnosed and an incredible</v>

71
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.900
<v Speaker 1>cost to the system to have to treat them</v>
<v Speaker 1>for five or six months in the wrong way</v>

72
00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.490
<v Speaker 1>before they actually get to the proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment.</v>

73
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's another way that Med ped can</v>
<v Speaker 1>help is by processing the information,</v>

74
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effectively,</v>

75
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and having the most up to date stuff</v>

76
00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.370
<v Speaker 1>available to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including your local physician who can</v>

77
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>then tap into that knowledge base and</v>
<v Speaker 1>help,</v>

78
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help that physician diagnose you</v>

79
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More often than not.</v>
