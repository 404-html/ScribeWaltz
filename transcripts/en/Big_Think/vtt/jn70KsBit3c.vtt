1
00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Is this question of scientific literacy</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States is in fact one of</v>

2
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>our greatest challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we scientists would want people to</v>

3
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>understand is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our science is not a challenge to their</v>

4
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>religion because that's the tension that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see rising in our society.</v>

5
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>You'll remember earlier I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we build theories.</v>

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't build trues as I understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions there about truths.</v>

7
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a different thing and in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that wall that actually protects</v>

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>religion from science and vice versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they're really about very</v>

9
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen Jay Gould,</v>

10
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>he used to call them non overlapping</v>
<v Speaker 1>magisterial and I think that's about</v>

11
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Galileel makes this comment about</v>

12
00:00:48.811 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>the difference two years in which these</v>
<v Speaker 1>two activities reside.</v>

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's of great importance to</v>
<v Speaker 1>us because we know from looking at</v>

14
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>several thousand years of history that</v>
<v Speaker 1>when religion and science clash,</v>

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>science generally loses.</v>

16
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 2000 years ago,</v>

17
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>there were two philosophers named</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle,</v>

18
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.630
<v Speaker 1>aristotle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knees,</v>

19
00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>and I'm [inaudible] who figured out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the earth was round.</v>

20
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>This belief was in conflict with beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Olympian gods.</v>

21
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>And so this scientific fact was lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>until it was rediscovered with,</v>

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 1>because about 1800 years later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the religion,</v>

23
00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't our one of our modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions,</v>

24
00:01:40.231 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>but it was a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are other examples.</v>

25
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:47.280
<v Speaker 1>The first person who had the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be life on another planet.</v>

26
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.730
<v Speaker 1>It was a priest by the name of Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Bruno.</v>

27
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>He paid in part for this with his life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So science loses when a society sees</v>

28
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>science and conflict with religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could do other examples.</v>

29
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that we would want</v>

30
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:12.951
<v Speaker 1>people to know about is that science is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a process by which we are trying to</v>

31
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 1>decrease our ignorance.</v>

32
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>We want to know more about the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to know it more accurately.</v>

33
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>And the ultimate purpose of this knowing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to increase the store house of human</v>

34
00:02:25.171 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 1>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is ultimately to be used to</v>

35
00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:34.611
<v Speaker 1>increase the quality of human life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most of us who do science would</v>

36
00:02:34.831 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>not do this if someone said you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn all these things,</v>

37
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.600
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day it's not for</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing everyone's quality of life.</v>

38
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 1>So I would personally want a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientifically literate citizen to</v>

39
00:02:52.081 --> 00:02:56.370
<v Speaker 1>understand that your scientists are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are really working on behalf</v>

40
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>of not perhaps you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that would be nice.</v>

41
00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe it's your children or your</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren or your great,</v>

42
00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>great grandchildren or great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

43
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:03.761
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

44
00:03:03.761 --> 00:03:04.211
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

45
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:04.631
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

46
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great grandchildren that in fact it's a.</v>

47
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a commitment to humanity and then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>guess the final thing that I like for</v>

48
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:18.061
<v Speaker 1>the scientifically literate</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen to do is to be a lifelong</v>

49
00:03:19.751 --> 00:03:20.584
<v Speaker 1>learner.</v>

50
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>To not disengage because most people</v>
<v Speaker 1>disengaged from science after they leave</v>

51
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>university because it's not relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their life.</v>

52
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>They're doing something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making money,</v>

53
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>making a life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're now moving into a period in</v>

54
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 1>the history of our nation</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

55
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have genomic science.</v>

56
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>I like to challenge people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

57
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>suppose you could have a daughter that</v>
<v Speaker 1>played tennis like Venus Williams and</v>

58
00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>looked like corner Kournikova and played</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf like tiger woods.</v>

59
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>Would you choose not to give her that</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity?</v>

60
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>What were the genomic science?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may not become a theoretical</v>

61
00:03:59.231 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to have to make clever</v>

62
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>choices as a society about the way we</v>
<v Speaker 1>apply science,</v>

63
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>Genomic Science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nano Science,</v>

64
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walk around normally hooked up to a</v>

65
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

66
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>I see you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have these plugs in your ears</v>

67
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:22.270
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of us are really plugged in while</v>

68
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:27.271
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you had a genomic device,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rather nanoscale device that you could</v>

69
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>surgically implant in your brain that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will allow you to directly access the</v>

70
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you make that decision?</v>

71
00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that would be really</v>

72
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:39.490
<v Speaker 1>convenient until you remember there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>hackers out there.</v>

73
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>You want people hacking in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're really some great challenges.</v>

74
00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>Scientists really putting us into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>position of</v>

75
00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>defining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>redefining what it means to be human,</v>

76
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.190
<v Speaker 1>but if that's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had better have as broader discussion</v>

77
00:04:57.191 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>as possible in our society about what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we want.</v>

78
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>This one</v>

79
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the general public disengaged.</v>
