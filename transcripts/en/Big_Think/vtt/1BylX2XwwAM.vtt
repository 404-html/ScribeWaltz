1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The first thing to understand before </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at cars that drive themselves,</v>

2
00:00:03.241 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>it's just how much of our lives cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>have become,</v>

3
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:09.120
<v Speaker 1>especially in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really all around the world.</v>

4
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 33,000</v>

5
00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Americans killed every year in car </v>
<v Speaker 1>accidents,</v>

6
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>more killed in car accidents in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

7
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Then in its entire history of war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>going back to the revolutionary war,</v>

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>we have one point 2 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed around the world.</v>

9
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the world's major diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it were a disease in terms of killing</v>

10
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:28.704
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also give 25 percent of all of </v>

11
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:33.294
<v Speaker 1>our energy to personal transportation </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 25 percent of our greenhouse gases </v>

12
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.400
<v Speaker 1>are going to the car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

13
00:00:38.401 --> 00:00:39.234
<v Speaker 1>this is not true in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Los Angeles it's estimated that </v>

14
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>more than half of the land in the city </v>
<v Speaker 1>belongs to the cars.</v>

15
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>Garages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's driveways,</v>

16
00:00:47.791 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>it's roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's parking lots.</v>

17
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 1>All of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>land that belongs to the car.</v>

18
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 1>We have given up so much of ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we depend on the car for so much.</v>

19
00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It shaped our cities that shaped our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

20
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The fact that now cars are going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer thing,</v>

21
00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>that the computer is going to be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important part of the car.</v>

22
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.194
<v Speaker 1>The thing that drives the car will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more important than the engine and this </v>

23
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>will be on the Moore's law curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about getting better,</v>

24
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>not the engine getting better every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

25
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 1>but the important part that drives it </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting better every year.</v>

26
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>The way computer technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>network technology do.</v>

27
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.953
<v Speaker 1>We're going to rewrite really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>elements of our society when we make </v>

28
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of these computerized technologies,</v>

29
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.263
<v Speaker 1>so most people thought that cars drive </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves or something from science </v>

30
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:33.714
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still routinely run into people who </v>

31
00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>say this is not in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 or 30 years away,</v>

32
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.160
<v Speaker 1>but this is clearly wrong and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more clearly wrong.</v>

33
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.003
<v Speaker 1>As time goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most famous project and the most </v>

34
00:01:44.281 --> 00:01:45.114
<v Speaker 1>advanced project has come not from a car</v>
<v Speaker 1>company but from Google and I worked </v>

35
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.254
<v Speaker 1>actually on Google's team for awhile and</v>
<v Speaker 1>building that vehicle so they have both </v>

36
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:53.604
<v Speaker 1>logged about 700,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles of driving on ordinary city </v>

37
00:01:56.791 --> 00:02:01.791
<v Speaker 1>streets with their vehicles and they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>now just released in May of 2014.</v>

38
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.480
<v Speaker 1>They have released a new vehicle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're building from scratch,</v>

39
00:02:06.481 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>designing from scratch which has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel in it,</v>

40
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.923
<v Speaker 1>no pedals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get in and you've given it a </v>

41
00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:13.194
<v Speaker 1>destination probably on your phone and </v>
<v Speaker 1>away it goes and takes you there and </v>

42
00:02:16.081 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the real game changer when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes out.</v>

43
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>The car companies also are all working </v>
<v Speaker 1>on efforts.</v>

44
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:21.534
<v Speaker 1>Every major car company has announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of effort and Nissan and </v>

45
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes and Volvo have all announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll be selling cars and about 20,</v>

46
00:02:28.651 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>20 that look a little bit more like </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional cars,</v>

47
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.693
<v Speaker 1>but what Google's car does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a vehicle that can run without </v>

48
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>steering wheel and nothing can run </v>
<v Speaker 1>unmanned and that's where it gets really</v>

49
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:39.534
<v Speaker 1>interesting because a vehicle that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>run on its own is a vehicle that can </v>

50
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>deliver itself to you.</v>

51
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.443
<v Speaker 1>It's a vehicle that can refuel or </v>
<v Speaker 1>recharge itself without you having to </v>

52
00:02:48.391 --> 00:02:49.224
<v Speaker 1>worry about it and it's a vehicle that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can store or what we used to call park </v>

53
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.813
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although it may mostly function as a </v>

54
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>taxi and as a tax seed wouldn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>park at all.</v>

55
00:02:58.471 --> 00:03:01.330
<v Speaker 1>It would just go pick up the next person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to pick up.</v>

56
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.450
<v Speaker 1>So today when people buy a car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go into the car dealership and they</v>

57
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>look for a multipurpose car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ask,</v>

58
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 1>what car do I need for my life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they think,</v>

59
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ski twice a year so I need an SUV.</v>

60
00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Or even though I live in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to ask you for you to get me up</v>

61
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>to the mountains every so often or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>number one selling car in America,</v>

62
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.133
<v Speaker 1>the Ford F 50 pickup truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not what most of those people </v>

63
00:03:26.171 --> 00:03:27.004
<v Speaker 1>need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we all go and buy at least a five </v>

64
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>passenger sedan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a multipurpose car for all of our needs.</v>

65
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 1>When you think of cars as fungible </v>
<v Speaker 1>objects almost,</v>

66
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:36.514
<v Speaker 1>that can be delivered on demand because </v>
<v Speaker 1>you pick up a cell phone and you asked </v>

67
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:39.844
<v Speaker 1>her car to come to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well suddenly you don't have to get a </v>

68
00:03:42.611 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>multipurpose guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get a car for that trip.</v>

69
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>The car that you need today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the car that you need right now,</v>

70
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>that is a very different car from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars we've made for the last century.</v>

71
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>These big fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boxy things.</v>

72
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>This is a car most of the time for one </v>
<v Speaker 1>person because almost all your trips are</v>

73
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

74
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:01.773
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're a very friendly person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're alone and they're just short </v>

75
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:05.284
<v Speaker 1>trips across town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we buy a car that's able to take </v>

76
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:08.254
<v Speaker 1>five people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of miles and that's very </v>

77
00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.183
<v Speaker 1>wasteful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very energy inefficient and it </v>

78
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>takes a lot of space on the road too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if most trips come in,</v>

79
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.524
<v Speaker 1>little small electric vehicles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular that are good enough for one </v>

80
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:25.561
<v Speaker 1>person or two people face to face and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a desk in them and a screen so</v>

81
00:04:25.751 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that you can work or watch videos and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and takes no time.</v>

82
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.913
<v Speaker 1>It's a very different vision of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation and it's a much lower </v>

83
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:33.304
<v Speaker 1>energy provision of transportation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly as you enable electric </v>

84
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:38.380
<v Speaker 1>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now today,</v>

85
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.840
<v Speaker 1>people don't buy electric vehicles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

86
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:42.230
<v Speaker 1>They buy some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly some,</v>

87
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.240
<v Speaker 1>some press being made about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>

88
00:04:44.241 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It's really a small portion of the car </v>
<v Speaker 1>market and they are worried that the car</v>

89
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>will run out of range or it'll take </v>
<v Speaker 1>hours to recharge it when they're done.</v>

90
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to hassle with plugging </v>
<v Speaker 1>it in,</v>

91
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>but a robot doesn't care about any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those hassles and the robot doesn't care</v>

92
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:58.444
<v Speaker 1>about anything and because of that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can get a vehicle that is electric </v>

93
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:03.544
<v Speaker 1>because you don't care about the range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't care about the powertrain at </v>

94
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:06.004
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so very different from the way cars are </v>

95
00:05:07.241 --> 00:05:08.074
<v Speaker 1>sold today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we have lots of small efficient </v>

96
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.744
<v Speaker 1>vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These vehicles are so efficient that </v>

97
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:13.930
<v Speaker 1>they don't just beat out.</v>

98
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>The cars were writing in now they beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>up the trains and the buses.</v>

99
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Even in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in Japan.</v>

100
00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.843
<v Speaker 1>That's how efficient small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight electric vehicles can be at </v>

101
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>carrying people in terms of energy use </v>
<v Speaker 1>to send a person a mile.</v>

102
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.733
<v Speaker 1>So this would mean that the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States would no longer have to import </v>

103
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:34.414
<v Speaker 1>oil from overseas and you've probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen there's a pesky habit that the US </v>

104
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:39.263
<v Speaker 1>has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to war over the oil </v>

105
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:42.920
<v Speaker 1>imports from overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be Very nice habit to be broken of.</v>

106
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>It also means reducing greenhouse gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>emissions by $200,</v>

107
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:48.064
<v Speaker 1>million tons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means getting rid of all the parking </v>

108
00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:55.480
<v Speaker 1>lots we have in our cities because if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to store vehicles in the same</v>

109
00:05:55.481 --> 00:05:56.314
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly there's a bonanza in so many </v>

110
00:05:58.851 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>towns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe not the dense downtown part,</v>

111
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.994
<v Speaker 1>but all of the surrounding territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>where so much of that land is parking </v>

112
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:05.324
<v Speaker 1>lots and for cars.</v>

113
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly we're going to turn some </v>
<v Speaker 1>parking lots into park land.</v>

114
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:09.553
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be pretty nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have tricks to deal with </v>

115
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:13.400
<v Speaker 1>congestion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's pretty big.</v>

116
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.103
<v Speaker 1>If you invest in real estate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably have heard a mantra that </v>

117
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>says the value of real estate is based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on three important factors,</v>

118
00:06:21.501 --> 00:06:22.334
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an old joke.</v>

119
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Location,</v>

120
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.433
<v Speaker 1>location and location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to change what location </v>

121
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>means because transportation is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>what locations about.</v>

122
00:06:31.521 --> 00:06:36.521
<v Speaker 1>It's having a short trip by either on </v>
<v Speaker 1>foot or on wheels or in transit or other</v>

123
00:06:37.281 --> 00:06:38.114
<v Speaker 1>things to the things in your life that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get to in the shops and the </v>

124
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.504
<v Speaker 1>people in the work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole nature of retailing is going </v>

125
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>to change because we're also going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build delivery robots that never carry a</v>

126
00:06:47.751 --> 00:06:49.790
<v Speaker 1>person and they're small and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

127
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>very cheap and they can get you anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 30 minutes,</v>

128
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>not just a pizza.</v>

129
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.153
<v Speaker 1>And now we do have a society that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side of the pizza is the most important </v>

130
00:06:57.441 --> 00:06:58.274
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to get it in 30 </v>

131
00:06:59.421 --> 00:07:00.171
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter when,</v>

132
00:07:00.171 --> 00:07:02.570
<v Speaker 1>no matter where you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>

133
00:07:02.571 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>if you can get anything cheaply in 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>minutes,</v>

134
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean for shopping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for retailing,</v>

135
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.100
<v Speaker 1>for how we use goods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we own goods.</v>

136
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.450
<v Speaker 1>It's going to change a lot more of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives and people think to have cars that</v>

137
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:15.284
<v Speaker 1>are smart in this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people want to know when this </v>

138
00:07:16.551 --> 00:07:19.200
<v Speaker 1>is going to come out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make jokes about naming a specific day</v>

140
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:22.430
<v Speaker 1>and time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

141
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>so we've seen forecasts for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different companies.</v>

142
00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sergei Brin first said Google,</v>

143
00:07:27.081 --> 00:07:29.600
<v Speaker 1>he thought would have cars and people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands in 2017,</v>

144
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:31.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread deployment.</v>

145
00:07:31.911 --> 00:07:32.744
<v Speaker 1>Not then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's happening in the later part </v>

146
00:07:34.941 --> 00:07:39.260
<v Speaker 1>of this decade and real deployment in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the early part of the 20 slash 20 a,</v>

147
00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 1>the car companies that have said 20 20th</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of their target year,</v>

148
00:07:42.351 --> 00:07:44.660
<v Speaker 1>most of them have said that although </v>
<v Speaker 1>tesla,</v>

149
00:07:44.661 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>because Elon Musk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CEO of Tesla,</v>

150
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>has the largest testicles of anyone in </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley.</v>

151
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.440
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

152
00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 1>he thinks he's going to have a car in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

153
00:07:54.351 --> 00:07:55.184
<v Speaker 1>We'll see if he delivers on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Volvo has also said they'll have cars </v>

154
00:07:58.131 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>running around their headquarters town </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the hands of civilians in 2017.</v>

155
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:03.223
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of people willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make predictions for really quick </v>

156
00:08:05.691 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

157
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.443
<v Speaker 1>will they spread like wildfire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like smartphones or will they spread </v>

158
00:08:11.811 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>like electric cars were really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really slowly?</v>

159
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm betting on more like smartphones.</v>

160
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:16.923
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not a bet that anyone can </v>

161
00:08:18.261 --> 00:08:19.094
<v Speaker 1>promise the answer to a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about vehicles that </v>

162
00:08:21.441 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>will be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be Hubris to suggest they could</v>

163
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>be perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be accidents,</v>

164
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:27.284
<v Speaker 1>there will be injuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there could unfortunately even be </v>

165
00:08:29.061 --> 00:08:29.894
<v Speaker 1>fatalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we do have a strong fear of being </v>

166
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>hurt by machines and good reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something to be afraid of,</v>

167
00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.030
<v Speaker 1>but the social question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't like being killed by robots</v>

168
00:08:42.031 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>and you'd rather be killed by drums </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what's happening today.</v>

169
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.783
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent of the fatalities on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>roads here are a have drinking involved </v>

170
00:08:50.961 --> 00:08:53.880
<v Speaker 1>in them and robots for better or worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely drink a.</v>

171
00:08:53.881 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>they'll make mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for different reasons.</v>

172
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.510
<v Speaker 1>And so as a society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an interesting question,</v>

173
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.290
<v Speaker 1>something you're very scared of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which is actually safer on the grill</v>

174
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:03.153
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nobody's going to release this </v>

175
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>technology until they've got the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence to themselves,</v>

176
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:09.360
<v Speaker 1>to their lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the public,</v>

177
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.160
<v Speaker 1>that it's doing a better job than people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are at driving.</v>

178
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>So you've got something that is better </v>
<v Speaker 1>than people,</v>

179
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.624
<v Speaker 1>but it's more frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you could indeed see societies </v>

180
00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>jumping back from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

181
00:09:21.391 --> 00:09:23.610
<v Speaker 1>whichever country decides to jump back </v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

182
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.503
<v Speaker 1>another country will jump in and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are many countries which can change </v>

183
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:27.744
<v Speaker 1>their laws and their liabilities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their rules very quickly in a way that </v>

184
00:09:30.211 --> 00:09:31.044
<v Speaker 1>the United States may be can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there will be global competition </v>

185
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>to see who rules the new car industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really mean the car industry.</v>

186
00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.400
<v Speaker 1>There is um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lesson that we teach over in silicon</v>

187
00:09:41.401 --> 00:09:42.234
<v Speaker 1>valley about what's called disruptive </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and when we go through </v>

188
00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:47.334
<v Speaker 1>disruptive change and the technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very uncommon for the big players </v>

189
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:54.570
<v Speaker 1>from the earlier generation to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through to the new world.</v>

190
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>And how many of you are using a Kodak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Camera,</v>

191
00:09:57.421 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 1>for example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not too many.</v>

192
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 1>So I fear for the car companies because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will die.</v>

193
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Some of them as we move to this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and the places where cars are made</v>

194
00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:09.361
<v Speaker 1>may shaft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

195
00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.194
<v Speaker 1>Detroit has a big challenge in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and it's going to face against </v>

196
00:10:12.571 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>wherever the new industry comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Japan,</v>

197
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:16.081
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

198
00:10:16.081 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>they also need to be afraid and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>the centers of car manufacturing today.</v>

199
00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.663
<v Speaker 1>But politicians actually are aware of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and they're interested in seeing </v>

200
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:24.684
<v Speaker 1>ways to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make sure that their economy becomes </v>

201
00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:27.894
<v Speaker 1>dominant in this world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why they've already passed </v>

202
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:32.720
<v Speaker 1>laws in several states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in other places around.</v>

203
00:10:32.730 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

204
00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.630
<v Speaker 2>world to enable this technology rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than slowing down.</v>
