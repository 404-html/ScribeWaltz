1
00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Surprise you to know that we are still</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning so much about our own solar</v>

2
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the question about how many planets</v>

3
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.130
<v Speaker 1>are there is kind of a funny one like</v>
<v Speaker 1>take Pluto.</v>

4
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>Pluto was classified as a dwarf planets</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are other dwarf planets as</v>

5
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:18.511
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

6
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:22.350
<v Speaker 1>the largest of the asteroid ceres is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>classified as a dwarf planet.</v>

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these dwarf planets actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>exist far through beyond the orbit of</v>

8
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>Pluto and we're just finding them now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of my favorite discoveries</v>

9
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>recently has been something called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goblin.</v>

10
00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Now the Goblin is a dwarf planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually much smaller than Pluto.</v>

11
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's only about a fifth day number two</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is really,</v>

12
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>really far out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's in a highly elongated orbit.</v>

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>The closest it ever gets is about twice</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far away as Pluto is and the farthest</v>

14
00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.580
<v Speaker 1>gets is about 2100 times the distance</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the earth to the sun.</v>

15
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>It goes way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

16
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>way out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This orbit takes it about 40,000 years</v>

17
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>to go once around the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

18
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>really incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surprise me that these</v>

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>objects are only recently being</v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered because most of them are so</v>

20
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 1>distant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are so faint and if they're at the</v>

21
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>very far part of their orbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're moving very,</v>

22
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>very slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

23
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 1>very hard to detect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

24
00:01:15.961 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 1>the Goblin is really interesting in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of ways.</v>

25
00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.440
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I love about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it does actually seem to hint</v>

26
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>that there may be something larger out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>and we've been noticing this for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last couple of years.</v>

28
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>These distant icy bodies are called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuyper belt objects and often they're on</v>

29
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>a long gated orbits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come close to the sun and by close</v>

30
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean about the orbit of Pluto and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

31
00:01:38.221 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>much farther away into the very outer</v>
<v Speaker 1>reaches of the solar system.</v>

32
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>We now know of dozens of these objects</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are probably many more out</v>

33
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>there we haven't discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing is we began to</v>

34
00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:51.840
<v Speaker 1>observe how their orbits were aligned in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our solar system.</v>

35
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>There's something called Para Helion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the closest pass and object</v>

36
00:01:56.311 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>makes to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Amazingly,</v>

37
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>all of these objects all over the sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to have para helium's closest</v>

38
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>approaches to the son that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautifully lined up together.</v>

39
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 1>There is no reason for that to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case if they were independent orbiting</v>

40
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way they're closest approach</v>

41
00:02:14.221 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should match.</v>

42
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is there's a larger body out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there somewhere,</v>

43
00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>a larger planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as it orbits it lines up kind of</v>

44
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>shepherds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these smaller objects into its</v>

45
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence for this really is pretty</v>

46
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 1>compelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know of any other way to</v>

47
00:02:32.071 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>explain the lined up orbits of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuyper belt objects.</v>

48
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is this bigger planet?</v>

49
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Our estimates put it at at least three</v>
<v Speaker 1>to five times the mass of the earth,</v>

50
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>maybe even a little bit more massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

51
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>It could be something on the order of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of Neptune.</v>

52
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>This is a big planet we're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and honestly,</v>

53
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a little embarrassing that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>missed an entire big planet in our solar</v>

54
00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:57.780
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are now so good at detecting planets.</v>

55
00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>We can see them around other stars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how has it,</v>

56
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>we've missed this planet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>if it really is very far away from us in</v>
<v Speaker 1>its orbit right now,</v>

58
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>even a big planet would be tiny to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful telescopes so we could</v>

59
00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>have missed it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also would be moving so slowly that</v>

60
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe we didn't notice that it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

61
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Maybe people assumed it was a distant</v>
<v Speaker 1>star,</v>

62
00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>so telescopes all over the world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>scanning the sky for any sense that</v>

63
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>there's an object out there moving very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very slowly that could be evidence of</v>

64
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>this giant planet.</v>

65
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.300
<v Speaker 1>Judging from the way these orbits are</v>
<v Speaker 1>lined up.</v>

66
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>I think it is very likely there could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big planet out there and I am going to</v>

67
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>be really happy when we have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>else to add to our knowledge of the</v>

68
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also something kind of wonderful</v>

69
00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>happening January 1st of 2019 it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up pretty soon and that is that</v>

70
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>we're going to visit one of these Kuyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt objects for the very first time,</v>

71
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>the new horizons spacecraft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years ago,</v>

72
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>flew by Pluto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully you remember the beautiful</v>

73
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>images of Pluto that it returned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we aimed it at one of these distant</v>

74
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Kuiper belt objects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call it [inaudible] 69 or it's been</v>

75
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>nicknamed ultimate Tulay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means far this frontier.</v>

76
00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you're a member of the new</v>

77
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:12.190
<v Speaker 1>horizons spacecraft from his spectacular</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly by Pluto a couple of years ago.</v>

78
00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>So after it flew by Pluto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we aimed at even farther out to</v>

79
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>encounter one of these distant ic</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects.</v>

80
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the first time we will ever see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of these objects is like after</v>

81
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>January,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will finally have a picture of a part</v>

82
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>of the solar system we've never seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

83
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
