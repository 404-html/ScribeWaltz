1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 2>the methods of developing drugs is sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of set up so that you know,</v>

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you try to control for a similar group</v>

4
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 2>of people and you give them a similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>pill,</v>

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the deal is,</v>

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know anything about their</v>

7
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:23.780
<v Speaker 2>genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.950
<v Speaker 2>so maybe they have these certain enzymes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in their body that like,</v>

9
00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 2>turn this drug over and turned it into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the active metabolite,</v>

11
00:00:32.271 --> 00:00:33.950
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that helps you.</v>

12
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you're a bad metabolizer and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>builds up in your liver and causes</v>

13
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the deal is the pharmaceutical</v>

14
00:00:44.241 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 2>companies would rather have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

15
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 2>have their market not limited by 66</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent.</v>

16
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 2>They would just like to sort of create a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug for everybody,</v>

17
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 2>throw it out to the mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the masses.</v>

18
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.760
<v Speaker 2>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it improves symptoms by five percent,</v>

19
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 2>well it's a drug and it's done its job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 2>but it actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you look at it across the</v>

21
00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:10.910
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a significant amount of people</v>

22
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:15.911
<v Speaker 2>that are harmed by that drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FDA tries to eliminate that as much</v>

23
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.010
<v Speaker 2>as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

24
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.940
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't always work.</v>

25
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.170
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are certain drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>

26
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we should not be taking.</v>

27
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:28.860
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

28
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>in 2009,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the FDA approved only 26 drugs,</v>

29
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of those were me too.</v>

30
00:01:34.991 --> 00:01:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs that were going off patent and</v>

31
00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 2>needed to be remarketed as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next purple pill,</v>

32
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to create,</v>

33
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a $400 a month blockbuster drug,</v>

34
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 2>a in exchange for a $4 a month generic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

35
00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.700
<v Speaker 2>I think that that is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

36
00:01:54.701 --> 00:01:57.910
<v Speaker 2>very shady practice and it's harming our</v>
<v Speaker 2>health,</v>

37
00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in exchange for,</v>

38
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a whole industry of</v>

39
00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>profitability off selling snake oil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>marketing gimmicks.</v>
