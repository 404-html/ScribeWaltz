00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>I think Google glass could be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible technology.</v>

2
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my Grad students,</v>

3
00:00:08.621 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>it's working at the lab is working on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous subtitle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>translation application for movies.</v>

5
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:23.221
<v Speaker 1>So you could go into a movie and be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish speaking person and you could go</v>

6
00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:28.621
<v Speaker 1>into an English language movie and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would show you the subtitles on the</v>

7
00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Google glass while you're watching the</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>

8
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>That to me would be very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we could do it in seven or eight</v>

9
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>languages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a fabulous application</v>

10
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:41.210
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even for people who are hard</v>

12
00:00:43.871 --> 00:00:47.230
<v Speaker 1>of hearing you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do that and it has a little,</v>

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone conductor in the back of the</v>

14
00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you could feel the shake of the</v>

15
00:00:51.671 --> 00:00:56.671
<v Speaker 1>buildings in an action movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also see the English subtitles,</v>

16
00:00:56.681 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that being said,</v>

17
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:05.581
<v Speaker 1>I also think that if I was at a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting political dinner party,</v>

18
00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.240
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone had google glass on,</v>

19
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>would I be as honest and open and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

20
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>just completely loose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after a bottle of wine as,</v>

21
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>as I would if they didn't have google</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass on.</v>

22
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.020
<v Speaker 1>cause I wouldn't be sure we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are they recording me or am I going to</v>

24
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>get home?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I going to regret what I'm saying.</v>

25
00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:38.530
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

26
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.820
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting question.</v>
