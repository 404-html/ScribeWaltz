1
00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely a growing trend.</v>

3
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always been a connection between</v>

4
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

5
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning there was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>distinction,</v>

6
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.190
<v Speaker 2>so aristotle was a philosopher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was also a biologist.</v>

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 2>He was also an economist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

8
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 2>and in a way he was a physicist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>

9
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 2>but it is coming closer together again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the reason for this is that,</v>

10
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.920
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

11
00:00:36.921 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>scientists are studying things of great</v>
<v Speaker 2>interest to philosophers like,</v>

12
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.090
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the scientific study of free will that</v>

13
00:00:44.091 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 2>really got going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not until the 19 eighties when these</v>

14
00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>Liberte experiments that I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>started up,</v>

15
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's been a lot of good social</v>

16
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 2>psychological work on things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>weakness of will and self deception for</v>

17
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 2>well more than decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 2>and I've been interested in that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>since I was young.</v>

19
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is growing I think.</v>

20
00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's more scientific done a</v>

21
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.920
<v Speaker 2>work done now on these philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 2>topics.</v>

22
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 2>Um.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

23
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what else it might be that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are thinking.</v>

24
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional philosophical methodologies</v>

25
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 2>have been around for a long time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gotten us to a certain place and</v>

26
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:25.580
<v Speaker 2>that's good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can get even further faster by</v>

27
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 2>bringing more on board,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

28
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>scientific results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.141
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:30.141 --> 00:01:32.780
<v Speaker 2>I actually do a lot of work with</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists.</v>

31
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I can mention this now.</v>

32
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm about to receive a four point</v>

33
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:44.381
<v Speaker 2>$8,000,000 grant to start a freewill</v>
<v Speaker 2>project at Florida State University</v>

34
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 2>where I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

35
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the granting agency is the John</v>

36
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 2>Templeton Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

37
00:01:51.681 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>most of the money will go out in grants</v>
<v Speaker 2>to scientists and others who make</v>

38
00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:01.361
<v Speaker 2>proposals on free will a two point 8</v>
<v Speaker 2>million that's going to go out to the</v>

39
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 2>science of freewill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what I'd like to see happen is that</v>

40
00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:10.310
<v Speaker 2>we have teams of neuroscientists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social psychologists and philosophers</v>

41
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 2>working together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.320
<v Speaker 2>to design a freewill studies and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

43
00:02:15.321 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 2>write up the papers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>analyze the results and so on.</v>

44
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for me this is a really exciting</v>

45
00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:22.340
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

46
00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.460
<v Speaker 2>at the intersection of science and</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy and,</v>

47
00:02:25.461 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing called experimental</v>

48
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:30.470
<v Speaker 2>philosophy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which didn't really exist until 10 years</v>

49
00:02:30.471 --> 00:02:34.640
<v Speaker 2>ago has really taken off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was up here in New York City last</v>

50
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 2>Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

51
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 2>to be in a session on experimental</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

52
00:02:37.971 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 2>There was a big audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of excitement.</v>

53
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in 10 years it's gone from nothing to</v>

54
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.110
<v Speaker 2>something pretty exciting.</v>
