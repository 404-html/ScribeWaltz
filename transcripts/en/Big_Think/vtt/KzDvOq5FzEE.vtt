1
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand that the New York fed is at</v>

2
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:17.721
<v Speaker 1>the vortex of all the regulation that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to occur with respect to banks.</v>

3
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:24.411
<v Speaker 1>The New York Fed is the least node,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most important regulatory body out</v>

4
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:26.430
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It oversees all the financial</v>

5
00:00:26.431 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controls,</v>

6
00:00:27.541 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>access to borrowing for these</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions and actually has,</v>

7
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>has individuals from the New York fed</v>
<v Speaker 1>present at each of the bags so it can</v>

8
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.851
<v Speaker 1>see and hear and feel what's going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marketplace and yet it failed abject</v>

9
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>late to see what was going on in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of leverage,</v>

10
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>in terms of risk exposure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

11
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Now this is all while Tim Geithner was</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the New York fed and Tim</v>

12
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Geithner said when he was being</v>
<v Speaker 1>confirmed for treasury secretary,</v>

13
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.560
<v Speaker 1>he had never been a regulator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should have been not just a flare,</v>

14
00:00:55.561 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>it should have been an exploding missile</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying this guy didn't understand his</v>

15
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>job and I think he has failed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>treasury secretary is a consequence.</v>

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Put that aside for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Aig Tobacco and the bailout of Aig,</v>

17
00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>where $180 billion of tax money was</v>
<v Speaker 1>funneled through Aig.</v>

18
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Much of it then being passed through aig</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the counter parties.</v>

19
00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:23.451
<v Speaker 1>Everybody from Goldman Sachs on down or</v>
<v Speaker 1>given 100 cents on the dollar on credit</v>

20
00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>default swaps they had bought from Aig</v>
<v Speaker 1>for no apparent reason.</v>

21
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Goldman was given a check for 12 point</v>
<v Speaker 1>$9 billion,</v>

22
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.160
<v Speaker 1>which is parenthetically just about</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely the profit they booked last</v>

23
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Calendar Year Oh nine so the entirety of</v>

24
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Goldman's profit you can think of as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax payer and fusion.</v>

25
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>Why did we give that to them now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geitner and blankfein would say because</v>

26
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.020
<v Speaker 1>we were owed oded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

27
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's what possible reason was there</v>

28
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>for taxpayers to give Goldman Sachs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what their conversation</v>
<v Speaker 1>was back and forth.</v>

30
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Would Goldman have failed absent that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fusion?</v>

31
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>Did we negotiate with Goldman in return</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get stock,</v>

32
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>get warrants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we negotiate the amount of the</v>

33
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>payment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why a hundred cents on the dollar?</v>

34
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>All sorts of other people have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken huge financial hits.</v>

35
00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Why did Goldman get paid off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many,</v>

36
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:23.331
<v Speaker 1>many areas of inquiry that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed and would be explained if we</v>

37
00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:29.151
<v Speaker 1>could break through and see aig is</v>
<v Speaker 1>emails radiating out into the regulatory</v>

38
00:02:30.301 --> 00:02:31.140
<v Speaker 1>and financial sector.</v>

39
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 1>Let me make it clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think Tim Geitner is a bad</v>

40
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>person by any stretch of the imagination</v>
<v Speaker 1>as he's,</v>

41
00:02:38.521 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>he's not corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not taking bags of cash.</v>

42
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not morally in any way suspect.</v>

43
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>He's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I say,</v>

44
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>there's no crime in being wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are all wrong,</v>

45
00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at one point or another in varying</v>

46
00:02:50.761 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm certainly in that category as</v>

47
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is as everybody knows.</v>

48
00:02:55.291 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And so he was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I say he failed his treasury</v>

49
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has failed as treasury secretary and</v>

50
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>is president of the New York Fed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because he did not bring the right</v>

51
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:09.511
<v Speaker 1>set of principles and an understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what his regulatory role was supposed</v>

52
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He embraced the Alan Greenspan worldview</v>

53
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>of let them do what they want because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the marketplace,</v>

54
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>somehow we'll provide a magic answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I think is the intellectual</v>

55
00:03:22.331 --> 00:03:24.880
<v Speaker 1>error that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has committed along with Larry</v>

56
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>Summers and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily smart,</v>

57
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>brilliant individual but just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

58
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>there's no crime in being wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that they've taken us to a</v>

59
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>point in terms of economic policy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not good and we have all paid a price</v>

60
00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>in terms of the cataclysm of the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years.</v>

61
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Understand that when the meltdown</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred.</v>

62
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>And so let's begin at the point of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>meltdown prior to the meltdown,</v>

63
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.960
<v Speaker 1>to give you a quick answer on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage was completely out of control</v>

64
00:03:50.961 --> 00:03:52.400
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There should have been dramatic</v>

65
00:03:52.401 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 1>limitations in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in back of leverage.</v>

66
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:57.980
<v Speaker 1>There should have been a redefinition of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what banks that had access to the</v>

67
00:03:57.981 --> 00:04:00.350
<v Speaker 1>federal window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Federal Reserve Window in terms of tax</v>

68
00:04:00.351 --> 00:04:02.120
<v Speaker 1>gain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gaining access to federal guarantees in</v>

69
00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:05.450
<v Speaker 1>actual cash could do with that money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's prospectively as well.</v>

70
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So retrospectively they failed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>control that,</v>

71
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.930
<v Speaker 1>the leverage and the risk that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coursing through the system.</v>

72
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we refer to it as</v>
<v Speaker 1>systemic risk prospectively.</v>

73
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.100
<v Speaker 1>The fundamental reform we need and put,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thankfully the president has now begun</v>

74
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:22.250
<v Speaker 1>to listen to Paul Volcker much more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Tim Geithner and Larry Summers on</v>

75
00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're beginning to say to banks,</v>

76
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 1>we will know no longer permit you to ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxpayers to cover the downside while</v>

77
00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:32.510
<v Speaker 1>you keep the upside.</v>

78
00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>It knows the asymmetry between risk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>reward is what led to the massive</v>

79
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:40.580
<v Speaker 1>overleveraging and overexposure of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

80
00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.890
<v Speaker 1>It's what we would have called it</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else's line,</v>

81
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:45.530
<v Speaker 1>not mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've socialized risk and privatized</v>

82
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:49.640
<v Speaker 1>gain and anytime I can play with a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>pile of money and if I lose,</v>

83
00:04:49.641 --> 00:04:51.170
<v Speaker 1>it's your problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I win,</v>

84
00:04:51.171 --> 00:04:54.500
<v Speaker 1>I keep the upside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I'm going to get involved in</v>

85
00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:58.730
<v Speaker 1>much riskier investments than I should</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we need to correct that balance.</v>

86
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Scale back the leverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell the banks do what banks are</v>

87
00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.660
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want access to federal dollars to</v>

88
00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:09.590
<v Speaker 1>d guaranteed deposits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lend that money to people who will</v>

89
00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:12.140
<v Speaker 1>create jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who will be businesses borrowing to</v>

90
00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:15.380
<v Speaker 1>expand rather than using it for either</v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge funds,</v>

91
00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 1>private equity investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>proprietary trading,</v>

92
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.620
<v Speaker 1>the sorts of endeavors that create great</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk through the system.</v>

93
00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.670
<v Speaker 1>So that is one structural issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the president has now begun to</v>

94
00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's post Massachusetts and post</v>

95
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>melt down or not,</v>

97
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't really matter to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's now getting that right.</v>

98
00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:37.310
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping that Geitner and summers</v>
<v Speaker 1>or having their wings clipped too,</v>

99
00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>because they're the ones who were not</v>
<v Speaker 1>articulating for the president.</v>

100
00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.670
<v Speaker 1>The obligation to put that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reform in place.</v>
