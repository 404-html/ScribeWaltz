00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.613
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are too many clashes</v>

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>within each of the civilizations to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

4
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.870
<v Speaker 1>a clash of it essentially as each of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations to describe them.</v>

6
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.010
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>it is true that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.410
<v Speaker 1>that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm fundamentalists or zealots or</v>

10
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.980
<v Speaker 1>Orthodox Ultra Orthodox people take</v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

11
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.683
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>then they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will repress the moderates and the</v>

15
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:58.111
<v Speaker 1>liberals in their own camp and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>confront them and that does,</v>

16
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 1>that does look like a kind of us against</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

17
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we always have to remember in those</v>

18
00:01:05.291 --> 00:01:07.870
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people who've been repressed,</v>

19
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>all of the liberal and secular Afghans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

20
00:01:12.521 --> 00:01:14.050
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

21
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.140
<v Speaker 1>who survive the Taliban regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we didn't hear from them while the</v>

22
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Taliban were in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there and those should be</v>

23
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since we all,</v>

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>since we always have allies in the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations,</v>

26
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a big mistake to try to,</v>

27
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>to try to describe it as a kind of war</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

28
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of unified culture.</v>
