1
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I've always done writing as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that I've done in the past.</v>

2
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Just various creative enterprises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I write songs and do music and uh,</v>

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.660
<v Speaker 1>write essays and short plays and sketch</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy and all these things.</v>

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And there during my twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Chicago and probably</v>

5
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>pursuing everything creatively that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can think of all at once and waiting for</v>

6
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>something to choose me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I got a job right out of graduate school</v>
<v Speaker 1>working for a local television show in,</v>

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.150
<v Speaker 1>in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I was doing writing for that,</v>

9
00:00:39.151 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>but I was also writing music and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing a little bit of performing.</v>

10
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I was writing plays and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also performing on stage and doing</v>

12
00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>the music thing and playing coffee</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses and Blues Clubs.</v>

13
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately,</v>

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just waiting for something to</v>

15
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>choose me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what happened was somebody</v>

16
00:00:59.251 --> 00:00:59.941
<v Speaker 1>suggested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:59.941 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>why don't you write a screenplay for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie?</v>

18
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.791
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I like movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I wrote one and,</v>

20
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and I looked at it and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was fun.</v>

21
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like that particular screen</v>

22
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't do anything with it,</v>

23
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>but then I wrote another one and send it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and somebody bought it and all of a</v>

24
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>sudden I was a screenwriter and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that was easy.</v>

25
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>I'll do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.690
<v Speaker 1>and so I just kept doing it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't had any reason to do anything</v>

27
00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:25.524
<v Speaker 1>else since.</v>

28
00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That good part.</v>

29
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Writing a screenplay is not so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all about knowing where the</v>

30
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>margins are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fighting a good screenplay is almost</v>

31
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:43.101
<v Speaker 1>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's part of,</v>

32
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>it has to do with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>being original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do something that feels fresh</v>

34
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 1>when there've been so many movies made</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

35
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>and also particularly in Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tendency to try and remake the same</v>

36
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>movies over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's writing a movie that's original,</v>

37
00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that becomes really difficult.</v>

38
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

39
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>there's something very formal about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>enterprise of writing a screenplay.</v>

40
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:12.420
<v Speaker 1>It can't be longer than two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>so the kind of story you tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

42
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:19.941
<v Speaker 1>it has to be as engaging and as exciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible within that one and a half</v>

43
00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>to two hour period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that forces certain kinds of</v>

44
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:27.150
<v Speaker 1>conventions on you or places where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

45
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>we really want to have them gripped in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the story by here or else they're going</v>

46
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>to leave or change the channel or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or walk out of the theater.</v>

47
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain kind of efficiency</v>

48
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 1>built into screenwriting that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very elegant,</v>

49
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>but that makes it as hard to craft as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very finely crafted piece of sculpture</v>

50
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>or furniture or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

52
00:02:52.501 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and making it all come alive when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just start putting together all the</v>

53
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Speaker 1>pieces of things that you visualize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be wonderful.</v>

54
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all seems in your mind to be</v>

55
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then what,</v>

56
00:03:03.191 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>when you look at what you've created on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the page,</v>

57
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>it's like a Frankenstein's monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a head,</v>

58
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:09.230
<v Speaker 1>you've got the hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got the feet,</v>

59
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you've got the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thought of everything.</v>

60
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>And when you look at it and it's still</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a bunch of dead meat lion there on</v>

61
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>the table and you're trying to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulse to go through the thing,</v>

62
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>what makes it real?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complete artifice.</v>

63
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>It's completely made up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all these things from your head and</v>

64
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>your desires and dreams and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

65
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:31.291
<v Speaker 1>it isn't real yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somehow something has to spark off</v>

66
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 1>the page that makes you to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to join the life that's going on in this</v>

67
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>world that you've created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to make that smooth life feel real</v>

68
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 1>when the whole thing is artifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all has agenda.</v>

69
00:03:43.151 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>It's all people you've created and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds that don't even exist.</v>

70
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making that feel real,</v>

71
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the absolute impossible thing.</v>

72
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Being original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it feel real and making it all</v>

73
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>fit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

74
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the easiest thing in the world and</v>

75
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely impossible.</v>

76
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a screenwriting is an art form,</v>

77
00:04:05.921 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a craft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's both of those things.</v>

78
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:10.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a commercial art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and both of those things you need to be</v>

80
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.270
<v Speaker 1>good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

81
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just know the craft and you don't</v>

82
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:19.720
<v Speaker 1>have any sense of the art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you don't have anything to</v>

83
00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you don't have an interesting way to</v>

84
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's all art and no craft,</v>

85
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>then you've got these great ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you aren't able to articulate them</v>

86
00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.480
<v Speaker 1>in a way that makes it all work out as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good blueprint for building a great</v>

87
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I definitely think there's,</v>

88
00:04:37.451 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a great deal of artistry</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>

89
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen a good screenplay that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was nothing but craft.</v>
