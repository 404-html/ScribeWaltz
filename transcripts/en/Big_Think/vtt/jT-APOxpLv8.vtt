1
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.220
<v Speaker 1>I would like to feel that my work has</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact in the world,</v>

2
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.420
<v Speaker 1>but I also need to approach this</v>
<v Speaker 1>question with a certain degree of</v>

3
00:00:14.421 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>humility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>we had Harvard sometimes think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're part of the greatest university in</v>

5
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are lots of other places now</v>

6
00:00:23.421 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>that are also doing great things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My work,</v>

7
00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.060
<v Speaker 1>if I have influenced some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people in leadership positions to</v>

8
00:00:32.061 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>do things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the important thing.</v>

9
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>I do have many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people who read my books,</v>

10
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>they quote me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

11
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm sometimes recognized in airports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also sit at meetings with world</v>

12
00:00:45.141 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>leaders where I am convinced of my utter</v>
<v Speaker 1>irrelevance.</v>

13
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that I have,</v>

14
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had an impact in terms of the term</v>

15
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>empowerment and the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>empowering people.</v>

16
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>I think my work on change has guided</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

17
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>many organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only through my books but through a</v>

18
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:09.581
<v Speaker 1>change tool kit on the worldwide web</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is being used by many companies and</v>

19
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:15.941
<v Speaker 1>governments around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the ideas have entered into</v>

20
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the vocabulary of leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much so that people sometimes forget</v>

21
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought of it first and I guess that's</v>

22
00:01:23.931 --> 00:01:27.200
<v Speaker 1>what's important because I'm going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>on to the next idea.</v>

23
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my proudest achievement is,</v>

24
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 1>it's so hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My proudest achievement is generally the</v>

25
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:41.891
<v Speaker 1>most recent because of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I had just put in so much effort</v>

26
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>and so much struggle to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really work hard.</v>

27
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.090
<v Speaker 1>None of it comes easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think of my books as proud</v>

28
00:01:50.091 --> 00:01:52.460
<v Speaker 1>achievements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm always proudest of the most</v>

29
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>recent because I think that I've gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>further in whatever that is.</v>

30
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly proud of my son of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being able to have a life</v>

31
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently balanced that I could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good family life and um,</v>

32
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>and set forth my son upon the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly proud of,</v>

33
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>of the companies I've changed of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas I've spawned and I could point to</v>

34
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:22.550
<v Speaker 1>particular ones of the presidential</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns that I've influenced of the</v>

35
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>world leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 1>with whom I've shared the stage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous events who had already been</v>

37
00:02:29.511 --> 00:02:33.200
<v Speaker 1>using my ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then go back and have learned</v>

38
00:02:33.201 --> 00:02:35.810
<v Speaker 1>something that often shapes their</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>

39
00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm asked questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:02:37.911 --> 00:02:41.210
<v Speaker 1>what should be the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>priority for Columbia?</v>

41
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 1>And I answer those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's thought leadership,</v>

42
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:50.591
<v Speaker 1>it's working with the power of ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wonderful that in this world of</v>

43
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:56.561
<v Speaker 1>giant enterprises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ibm as 350,000 people and enormously</v>

44
00:02:57.741 --> 00:03:02.741
<v Speaker 1>advanced technology and yet one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>whispering in the ear of a world leader</v>

45
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:09.241
<v Speaker 1>or an IBM executive can often change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of that company and sometimes the</v>

46
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>course of history,</v>

47
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>women in business</v>

48
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Speaker 1>as well as women in leadership positions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in any sector have been something that</v>

49
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I've been very concerned about my entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional life.</v>

50
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>And I have to say it was selfish because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got my phd at a time when there were</v>

51
00:03:32.491 --> 00:03:37.491
<v Speaker 1>very few people like me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was often the first of my kind sitting</v>

52
00:03:38.491 --> 00:03:42.870
<v Speaker 1>in a room with people of another kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sometimes true by the way,</v>

53
00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:47.820
<v Speaker 1>when I go as an American to the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>East now where I'm very different in</v>

54
00:03:47.821 --> 00:03:51.120
<v Speaker 1>many respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I was very concerned about,</v>

55
00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting more women.</v>

56
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was in my self interest to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have my women colleagues first of all.</v>

57
00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Then the whole image of women would</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have been elevated,</v>

58
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.920
<v Speaker 1>but also I wouldn't have had to sit</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and answer silly questions about</v>

59
00:04:04.921 --> 00:04:08.820
<v Speaker 1>what's the women's point of view that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted more at the table.</v>

60
00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>I also do care about opportunity and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about not breaking,</v>

61
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.260
<v Speaker 1>not being confined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I care about,</v>

62
00:04:16.261 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I care about opportunity and I care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about not being trapped behind</v>

63
00:04:21.001 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now we've had the breakthroughs.</v>

64
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly more women in</v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership positions and lots and lots</v>

65
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:33.930
<v Speaker 1>of women in the pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I'm concerned about now is that we</v>

66
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:38.931
<v Speaker 1>haven't changed institutions enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it possible for women who want to</v>

67
00:04:40.951 --> 00:04:45.951
<v Speaker 1>devote themselves to their children</v>
<v Speaker 1>during formative years to do that or for</v>

68
00:04:46.711 --> 00:04:49.200
<v Speaker 1>men for that matter who say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

69
00:04:49.201 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to devote my time to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>children to do that.</v>

70
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Without feeling they sacrifice their</v>
<v Speaker 1>careers.</v>

71
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.330
<v Speaker 1>I think we still don't have enough women</v>
<v Speaker 1>in leadership to make it totally normal.</v>

72
00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Or we wouldn't ask today's silly woman</v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

73
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 1>which is was carly Fiorina fired because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was a woman?</v>

74
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She wasn't,</v>

75
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:14.301
<v Speaker 1>but all the attention she got afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>was because we had so few women ceos,</v>

76
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:18.540
<v Speaker 1>we didn't take it for granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we have to get more women in</v>

77
00:05:18.541 --> 00:05:19.050
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

78
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 1>In order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to help those talented women in</v>

79
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:27.891
<v Speaker 1>the pipeline feel that they can continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to advance without sacrificing important</v>

80
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>things to them in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to sacrifice their</v>

81
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:35.100
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor do they have to sacrifice their</v>

82
00:05:35.101 --> 00:05:39.180
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that more men ought to take on</v>

83
00:05:39.181 --> 00:05:42.390
<v Speaker 1>some of those family responsibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was important to me.</v>

84
00:05:42.391 --> 00:05:47.391
<v Speaker 1>I always felt there was a reason for two</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and my husband did a great deal</v>

85
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 1>and so we could lead more balanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

86
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that to me is the frontier is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do about work and family work</v>

87
00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>life balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we crack that,</v>

88
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.530
<v Speaker 1>we will see all those talented women</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking on responsibilities and it will</v>

89
00:06:05.571 --> 00:06:10.571
<v Speaker 1>look completely normal to have women do</v>
<v Speaker 1>important leadership tasks.</v>
