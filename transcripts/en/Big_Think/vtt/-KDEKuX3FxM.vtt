1
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American theater is lousy with</v>

2
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>hidden gems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think in particular there are a</v>

3
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>lot of place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What used to be,</v>

4
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:18.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still called wellmade place,</v>

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>the thirties and forties that fell out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fashion when the fashion and American</v>

6
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:28.431
<v Speaker 1>theater turned towards more personal</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressionistic playwriting at Tennessee</v>

7
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Williams really marks the big change in</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction here.</v>

8
00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot to be said for the</v>

9
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>wellmade witty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clever three act comedy.</v>

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>there's a playwright named sn Bearman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Bearman,</v>

12
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>who wrote these kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of social comedies that are actually</v>

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 1>extremely sharp and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

14
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 1>and still quite provocative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>he has a play called biography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about to be produced off</v>

16
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Broadway that I'm going to see that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually seen that produced an excited</v>

17
00:01:00.901 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>by it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>John Ruetten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another purveyor of wellmade boulevard</v>

19
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>theater that's actually much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging and interesting than you</v>

20
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:10.860
<v Speaker 1>might expect.</v>

21
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a wonderful play called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice of the turtle three character play</v>

22
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>that has never had a modern production</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the east coast so far as I know,</v>

23
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British playwrights,</v>

24
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.120
<v Speaker 1>terence Radigan in particular who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are also totally unfashionable</v>

25
00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>because of their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their being rooted in traditional ways</v>

26
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>of play construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that this is the best or</v>

27
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:34.500
<v Speaker 1>the only way to write a play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like Tennessee Williams as much as the</v>

28
00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>next guy and Sam Shepard and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of different ways of</v>

29
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:42.951
<v Speaker 1>writing plays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that that what worked</v>

30
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>in the thirties and forties should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>disregarded simply because it is no</v>

31
00:01:46.561 --> 00:01:49.410
<v Speaker 1>longer fashionable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's something that I sort of</v>

32
00:01:49.411 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 1>crusade for in my own writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look for productions of playwrights</v>

33
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.204
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

34
00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>David cromer from Chicago I think is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most gifted young director in America.</v>

35
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.760
<v Speaker 1>He had a real setback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just made his Broadway debut last</v>

36
00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>month with the what was supposed to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>repertory production to Neil Simon plays</v>

37
00:02:10.991 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>and they closed it after the first one</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened and before the second one got</v>

38
00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to stop him.</v>

39
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>This is a guy who is his imagination</v>
<v Speaker 1>just oozes out of his pores.</v>

40
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Speaker 1>He did an off Broadway production of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

41
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last season.</v>

42
00:02:26.321 --> 00:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>It's still running in which he played</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage manager.</v>

43
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody seen our town.</v>

44
00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Your high school did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably did it when you were in,</v>

45
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 1>in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an utterly familiar play and</v>

46
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:41.320
<v Speaker 1>cromer without distorting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without transforming it,</v>

47
00:02:41.321 --> 00:02:46.321
<v Speaker 1>beyond recognition made an absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>new and fresh and every moment of it was</v>

48
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:48.580
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did the same thing with the</v>

49
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>production of the glass menagerie that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw in Kansas City last year.</v>

50
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>The same thing with the production of</v>
<v Speaker 1>William enjoys a picnic that I saw in</v>

51
00:02:56.381 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Chicago two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

52
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I got onto him because I travel in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most other critics don't.</v>

53
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I was aware of him earlier than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than he was generally known in New York.</v>

54
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>And now he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is at the top of the list of</v>

55
00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>directors whose work I will travel to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>

56
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>He excites me.</v>
