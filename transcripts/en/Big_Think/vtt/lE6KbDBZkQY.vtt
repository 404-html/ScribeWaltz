1
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Stop worrying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't learn to live,</v>

2
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>to love the bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stop worrying.</v>

3
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran is so far away from having a</v>

4
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.430
<v Speaker 1>I know there's all this reports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these alarmist reports.</v>

6
00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Iran has enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You rich uranium to build a bomb</v>

7
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>building a bomb is not as simple as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>

9
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the designs are on the Internet and you</v>

10
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to actually create a nuclear weapon</v>

11
00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>is going to be so difficult for Iran to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do quietly.</v>

12
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm secretly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

13
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've enriched uranium to three</v>

14
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>percent or four percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the number is that is useful</v>

15
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>for as fuel to then enrich it to 90</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever percent they would have to.</v>

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean it would have to be done under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the watchful eyes of the IAEA,</v>

17
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>so we would know about it the minute</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it,</v>

18
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>it's not like they have this other</v>
<v Speaker 1>secret facility or at least even the</v>

19
00:00:59.311 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>IAEA doesn't think they have the secret</v>
<v Speaker 1>facility where they're doing exactly</v>

20
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing in front of the IAEA</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can then secretly go out and in</v>

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.830
<v Speaker 1>and enrich to a higher level.</v>

22
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.280
<v Speaker 1>So once you've enriched it to a higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

23
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>surely you'd want to test a nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>weapon before you just fired it off.</v>

24
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it runs so far away from testing and</v>

25
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we wouldn't even know know the North</v>

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Koreans tested weapons and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not even sure that they worked.</v>

27
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do know that Israel has nuclear</v>

28
00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do know they have a delivery system</v>

29
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>for those nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the kinds of missiles that</v>

30
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>could deliver accurate missiles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could deliver nuclear weapons to Iran.</v>

31
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Iran is so far away from having that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>

32
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some would say,</v>

33
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being naive.</v>

34
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>They could do it in a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could do it in two years.</v>

35
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>But to be so many signals before that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened that we could get,</v>

36
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 1>we could become really alarmed if Iran</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly shuts down the IAEA cameras 24</v>

37
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>hours a day on their facility where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>using the riskier.</v>

38
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>They shut down those cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say,</v>

39
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the beginning of a cause of</v>

40
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 1>alarm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they doing that they want to</v>

41
00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.790
<v Speaker 1>get rid of the IAEA inspectors?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

42
00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>we're so far away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we should let the AIAA do</v>

43
00:02:02.971 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>their job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We should at least talk to the Iranians.</v>

44
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that they have the</v>

45
00:02:07.741 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>technology to enrich uranium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to bomb that technology</v>

46
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:13.560
<v Speaker 1>out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of people in Iran who can</v>

47
00:02:13.561 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>start up a centrifuge program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if this program was completely</v>

48
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question now becomes,</v>

49
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>how do we incentivize the Iranians to</v>
<v Speaker 1>never take that step?</v>

50
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>We know that they have the knowledge to</v>
<v Speaker 1>build centrifuges,</v>

51
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 1>to enrich uranium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people analyst will tell</v>

52
00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear scientists will say it's not a</v>

53
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>big step to then go to a bomb.</v>

54
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>It is actually a bigger step than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think because you have to test it.</v>

55
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>You have to create that perfect sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have the mechanism,</v>

56
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>you have to have the delivery system to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver it.</v>

57
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Presumably you want a second strike</v>
<v Speaker 1>capability,</v>

58
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>not just a first strike capability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a first strike capability,</v>

59
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:49.800
<v Speaker 1>if somebody has a second strike on you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're done.</v>

60
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>So you want to have this that to be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal in terms of nuclear power with</v>

61
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Israel for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do we incentivize them to not</v>

62
00:02:59.771 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>take that step and that's where</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiations come in because there are</v>

63
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>plenty of countries that do have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to.</v>

64
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>Japan is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're never incentivized to go and</v>

65
00:03:07.181 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>build a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

66
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are countries that have the</v>

67
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>ability to enrich uranium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the ability to even probably build</v>

68
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>a bomb if they want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what stops them from doing it?</v>

69
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

70
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>they'd have no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have no incentive.</v>

71
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.930
<v Speaker 1>None whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have all the disincentives to build</v>

72
00:03:22.931 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>a bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what we have to do is figure out</v>

73
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to disincentivize Iran from ever</v>

74
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>taking that step.</v>
