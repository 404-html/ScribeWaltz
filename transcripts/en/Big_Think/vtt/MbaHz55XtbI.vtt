00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>The curiosity of showing yours is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.820
<v Speaker 1>to have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>a non national point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none national editorial line,</v>

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we cover a country,</v>

5
00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>which we don't take it upon themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this particular country,</v>

6
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>but to try to take the monitor from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring countries as well.</v>

7
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we reported about bras,</v>

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.490
<v Speaker 1>says a converse it to other European</v>
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>we don't take the national point of view</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what is doing for her,</v>

10
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>for her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This particular country are taking the</v>

11
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 1>general interest of the European site</v>
<v Speaker 1>large and we try to understand if what</v>

12
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>he's doing is good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Foster Europeans as a whole and not for</v>

13
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>a particular country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what makes you do,</v>

14
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>is very specific in reporting about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

15
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>We present a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both a rationale itself course,</v>

16
00:00:58.921 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every country,</v>

18
00:01:01.861 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>both Greece and Germany has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are good reasons to,</v>

20
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.401
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

21
00:01:06.401 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>act as they did a.</v>

22
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:11.370
<v Speaker 1>of course a grease is 50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>44,</v>

23
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>having accumulated so much debt and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>her not having a put in place the</v>

24
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>reforms as they need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then now try to implement a and a</v>

25
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.261
<v Speaker 1>converse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

26
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that claim form for a bit our</v>

27
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>trough European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your other European countries is</v>

28
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>natural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of the European solidarity.</v>

29
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.540
<v Speaker 1>And nobody can contest that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point of Germany is that in fact</v>

30
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>since the other white systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest country in Europe,</v>

31
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 1>there is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've accumulated so much support or</v>

32
00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>other European countries that are now</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it'll fit up.</v>

33
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>And so you can also understand their</v>
<v Speaker 1>point of views.</v>

34
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>There are countries like Greece or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor to manage their,</v>

35
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own province properly,</v>

36
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

37
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but it is also a rupture with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional,</v>

38
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:05.271
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm a common understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Germany that Germany was a support in</v>

40
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

41
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because of its particular history,</v>

42
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a political necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So also in Germany,</v>

43
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>there are some mixed feelings about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.400
<v Speaker 1>whether a high as a country should our</v>
<v Speaker 1>net react as Mrs Parker did.</v>

45
00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>So in your use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

46
00:02:22.291 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>we present or facets of a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>represented on screen.</v>

47
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>You can see people shouting the streets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of attendance.</v>

48
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>You can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 1>a German leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 1>saying that Greece should set,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set out the islands in order to recover</v>

51
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.620
<v Speaker 1>some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely a crazy idea,</v>

52
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>but we don't say it's a crazy idea which</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to report a story every present</v>

53
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 1>because we try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.080
<v Speaker 1>to treat the viewer as an adult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to present him facts as they are</v>

55
00:02:55.081 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>and to help him making his own</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessment of the situation,</v>

56
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.050
<v Speaker 1>his own judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what,</v>

57
00:03:01.051 --> 00:03:02.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think,</v>

58
00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:04.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our remit.</v>

59
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.150
<v Speaker 1>And now a guitar line</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the main challenge is to,</v>

60
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.710
<v Speaker 1>to be simpler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be simple and attractive for the</v>

61
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:18.510
<v Speaker 1>viewer because I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course a national union hasn't</v>

62
00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>disappeared in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are still very nationalist and</v>

63
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>say they care shiftly for their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic affairs.</v>

64
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.750
<v Speaker 1>So to make them to create a sense that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a neighbor or fs are interesting for</v>

65
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:34.820
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only intellectually,</v>

66
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>but also practically a if they want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make business with neighboring countries</v>

67
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:42.120
<v Speaker 1>and also European countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want to travel to,</v>

68
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

69
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.410
<v Speaker 1>to be altruistic reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

70
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>they need to understand that the better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we try to make it simple and</v>

71
00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:53.251
<v Speaker 1>attractive for every European watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>your used to have an eye on what to and,</v>

72
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.360
<v Speaker 1>and to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

73
00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to catch a with a better understanding</v>

74
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>of the situation abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not easy because people,</v>

75
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everywhere in the world I think.</v>

76
00:04:07.151 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.733
<v Speaker 1>in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>one could think that there is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity,</v>

79
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 1>feelings and is the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really the case.</v>

80
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's very nationalistic.</v>

81
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to create these feelings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that every,</v>

82
00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>some solidarity between people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not easy.</v>
