00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.903
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>the supreme court has a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent authority would just take</v>

5
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>this term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>it may be that the city council of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago,</v>

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>of New York of La wants to ban handguns</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their city.</v>

8
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as of this year,</v>

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>too bad supreme court says you can't do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

10
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 1>You know that that is real power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In one,</v>

11
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite quotes about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>supreme court comes from Robert Jackson</v>

12
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>who said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not justice Robert Jackson who</v>

13
00:00:41.301 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>said we are not final because we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>infallible.</v>

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.200
<v Speaker 1>We are infallible because we are final.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody has to have the last word and</v>

15
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>in our country it's the supreme court.</v>

16
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I have a judicial</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy to speak of.</v>

17
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>

18
00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess in my book,</v>

19
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.840
<v Speaker 1>in my analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am somewhat cynical,</v>

20
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:12.490
<v Speaker 1>realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call it,</v>

21
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:17.491
<v Speaker 1>about the political nature of judging</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the constitution.</v>

22
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>When you are addressing questions like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does the constitution protect a woman's</v>

23
00:01:24.221 --> 00:01:29.221
<v Speaker 1>right to choose abortion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the constitution allow a,</v>

24
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 1>a university to consider race in</v>
<v Speaker 1>admissions?</v>

25
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 1>I don't think those questions have right</v>
<v Speaker 1>or wrong answers when it comes to</v>

26
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>interpreting the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are reasonable views on</v>

27
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>both sides as a legal matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think is that there are</v>

28
00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

29
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

30
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.720
<v Speaker 1>it depends what you think in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your political philosophy.</v>

31
00:01:49.721 --> 00:01:54.721
<v Speaker 1>I think political philosophy means more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than legal competence or expertise in</v>

32
00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>deciding to big constitutional issues.</v>

33
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

34
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:05.763
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>

35
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:10.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

36
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.831
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

37
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:16.831
<v Speaker 1>I think there are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are terrific thinkers</v>

38
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>about the court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like reading Cass Sunstein.</v>

39
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:24.940
<v Speaker 1>I like reading Larry tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like reading a Richard Posner.</v>

40
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I liked reading a Ronald Dworkin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a moment where there are a</v>

42
00:02:34.151 --> 00:02:39.151
<v Speaker 1>lot of judges out there who are legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers in the way that there have</v>

43
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 1>been in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people with distinctive</v>

44
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:47.671
<v Speaker 1>philosophies that they apply in</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting and important ways,</v>

45
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think there are a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>geniuses in the way that there were.</v>

46
00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>There were when there was homes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn at hand.</v>
