1
00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.463
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I am Fred Wilson and I am the managing</v>
<v Speaker 2>partner of Union square ventures.</v>

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 2>It's been changing the way I work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past 15 years.</v>

4
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>I see it as an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an evolution,</v>

5
00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.450
<v Speaker 1>not really a revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

6
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think every year there are two or</v>

7
00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:32.131
<v Speaker 1>three new things that I use as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my daily life that I wasn't using the</v>

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>year before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:41.221
<v Speaker 1>I think social media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be blogging or I'm a social</v>

11
00:00:43.961 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>networking or things at the intersection</v>
<v Speaker 1>of blogging and social networking,</v>

12
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>like twittering and so on and so forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are becoming incredibly more</v>

13
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>valuable to me as business tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were two or three years ago,</v>

14
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've used the phone less and less</v>

15
00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to say that when I got into the</v>

16
00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.920
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.840
<v Speaker 1>in the mid eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phone was the way that I did 80</v>

18
00:01:07.841 --> 00:01:12.841
<v Speaker 1>percent of my work by the mid nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>email had become the dominant form of</v>

19
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the way I did most of my work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the phone had gone down</v>

20
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>substantially.</v>

21
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Now social media and blogging and</v>
<v Speaker 1>twittering and things like that have,</v>

22
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have become the highest form of the way</v>

23
00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>I do my work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Email has come down relatively speaking</v>

24
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>in value and the phone is almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely gone from the tool set that I</v>

25
00:01:36.131 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>use to get stuff done now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Face to face interaction has been a</v>

26
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:42.670
<v Speaker 1>constant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

27
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see,</v>

28
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that has changed one bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:47.021 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>going to a board meeting or having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>face to face meeting with an</v>

30
00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>in order to decide whether we want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make an investment is as valuable or</v>

32
00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 1>more valuable today than it was 20 or 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

33
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that hasn't lost any value,</v>

34
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but the phone has come way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way down and now I see email coming down</v>

35
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:04.714
<v Speaker 1>a lot too.</v>

36
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.020
<v Speaker 2>I think that several things going on,</v>

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this generation is going to be a,</v>

39
00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>a very different kind of workforce and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the workforce that businesses have known</v>

40
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they will be a lot less loyal to</v>

41
00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:30.990
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will be.</v>

42
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in maximizing the value</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their career as opposed to the value</v>

43
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.410
<v Speaker 1>of the stock of the company that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working for it,</v>

44
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>unless they control that stock or own a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big piece of it.</v>

45
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.810
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at,</v>

46
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm very much immersed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mercenary,</v>

47
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 1>mercenary workforce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>we've already seen that in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology business for the past 10</v>

49
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly among software developers</v>

50
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.020
<v Speaker 1>in Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

51
00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

52
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best software engineers are</v>

53
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>constantly getting poached from company</v>
<v Speaker 1>to company company and getting better</v>

54
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>and better deals along the way in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way that a,</v>

55
00:03:07.691 --> 00:03:12.691
<v Speaker 1>I'm a film star or a music recording</v>
<v Speaker 1>star would be constantly being offered a</v>

56
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>better and better contract to go work</v>
<v Speaker 1>for somebody new.</v>

57
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Same thing's happening with software</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineers and I think that that kind of</v>

58
00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:25.801
<v Speaker 1>mindset about talent is what this</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger generation's all about.</v>

59
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>And so they're all going to be about</v>
<v Speaker 1>building their own personal brand and</v>

60
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>their own personal career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own personal portfolio of what</v>

61
00:03:33.071 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they can make themselves</v>

62
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>available to the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the highest bidder.</v>

63
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for us,</v>

64
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.120
<v Speaker 1>the biggest impact and in the companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've backed is that,</v>

65
00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can hire somebody,</v>

66
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the best person for the job,</v>

67
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they are not necessarily willing to</v>

68
00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:57.440
<v Speaker 1>locate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking here in New York City.</v>

69
00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So we have companies in New York City</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have a software engineers all over</v>

70
00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:04.400
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have people in New York City that</v>

71
00:04:04.401 --> 00:04:09.401
<v Speaker 1>have product managers or whole customer</v>
<v Speaker 1>services organizations in another</v>

72
00:04:09.591 --> 00:04:10.850
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:13.520
<v Speaker 1>you can put</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

74
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>your high labor cost workforce somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else than where your headquarters is and</v>

75
00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:20.571
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

76
00:04:20.571 --> 00:04:21.660
<v Speaker 1>and make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

77
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and this has obviously been going on for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a long time,</v>

78
00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.650
<v Speaker 1>but this is a trend that will continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.800
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all forever probably,</v>

80
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have been profoundly affected by this.</v>

81
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:44.011
<v Speaker 1>I write a web log that is read by about</v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000 people a month.</v>

82
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.580
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.920
<v Speaker 1>within that group I'd say there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably about 20,000 people who are</v>

84
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:54.100
<v Speaker 1>sort of the most hardcore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:04:54.101 --> 00:04:56.680
<v Speaker 1>committed participants in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

86
00:04:56.681 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 1>And I really mean community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people do meet ups,</v>

87
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>they comment on my blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have offline conversations with</v>

88
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:04.450
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they meet each other,</v>

89
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 1>they go and do startups together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>says this community that exists,</v>

90
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I consider probably at least a thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these people friends,</v>

91
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>and yet I have met um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and advisors,</v>

92
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:20.640
<v Speaker 1>and I've maybe met 100 or 200 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

94
00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'll get emails from people who I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been communicating with and dialoguing</v>

95
00:05:26.561 --> 00:05:28.840
<v Speaker 1>with for three or four years saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>you need to go visit this company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw what they were doing yesterday and</v>

97
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely revolutionary and,</v>

98
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.290
<v Speaker 1>and I'll go do it even though I've never</v>
<v Speaker 1>met this person because I,</v>

99
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>I know who they are.</v>

100
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>I've been able to develop a relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them online.</v>

101
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I've had conversations with them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions and debates and uh,</v>

102
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's brand new that has never</v>
<v Speaker 1>existed in the world of business.</v>

103
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>And we are leveraging that in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

104
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think that lots of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>leveraging it in all different kinds of</v>

105
00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Businesses are starting to engage with</v>

106
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.180
<v Speaker 1>their customers using these tools in</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that they've never done before and</v>

107
00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.840
<v Speaker 1>they're starting to get feedback from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their customers in terms of what's</v>

108
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>working and what's not working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what products are good and what products</v>

109
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 1>are not good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what people in their organizations are</v>

110
00:06:17.391 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>good and what people in organizations</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not good.</v>

111
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are starting to develop a</v>

112
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:27.461
<v Speaker 1>level of trust around this kind of blind</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anonymous or semi anonymous kind of</v>

113
00:06:27.981 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>communication that they didn't trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or 10 years ago because it was so</v>

114
00:06:31.671 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now people are seeing,</v>

115
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can trust that kind of feedback even</v>

116
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>though I'm not getting it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a traditional way.</v>

117
00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's been going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time programmers have been using</v>

118
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>something called IRC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Internet relay chat.</v>

119
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:50.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're these sort of form your own</v>

120
00:06:50.751 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 1>chat rooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what programming teams have done</v>

121
00:06:54.021 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>for the better part of 10 or 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 20 years is they all come in in</v>

122
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 1>the morning and one person's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Vancouver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada and one person's in New York</v>

124
00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one person's in,</v>

125
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>in Buenos Aires and another person's in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bangalore,</v>

126
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>they all come into this IRC chat room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're writing code and talking to</v>

127
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:14.720
<v Speaker 1>each other at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're saying,</v>

128
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do I hit this database?</v>

129
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>

130
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 1>what's the query I need to use?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person who has the database guy</v>

131
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:21.621
<v Speaker 1>in Bangladesh has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

132
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>you write this query this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're collaborating using these</v>

133
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>online tools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's been going on for a long time</v>

134
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.350
<v Speaker 1>now for um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.360
<v Speaker 1>a marketing organization that's not as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geeky,</v>

136
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not a,</v>

137
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.250
<v Speaker 1>that's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good way for them to work,</v>

138
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>but they can use a Wiki,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is basically a website that exists</v>

139
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>inside the firewall and outside the</v>
<v Speaker 1>firewall they can post questions to it</v>

140
00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>that's happening.</v>

141
00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are,</v>

142
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are even companies that are using</v>

143
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>facebook groups I'm in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of a public group,</v>

144
00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:57.230
<v Speaker 1>but people are using that even for</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

145
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>So there are a hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not thousands of different tools that</v>

146
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.820
<v Speaker 1>exists for businesses to do these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things.</v>

147
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

148
00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 1>more being developed every day.</v>
