1
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.670
<v Speaker 1>What was it like growing up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Midwest in the 70?</v>

2
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:16.504
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably more like</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up in Hawaii or Washington state</v>

4
00:00:25.581 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>or Florida in the 70s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it was like growing up in the</v>

5
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Midwest and other decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if it was mostly the seventies</v>

6
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 1>and those were the same everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe we took it a little bit less</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironically.</v>

8
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that kind of personal growth and</v>

9
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:46.310
<v Speaker 1>self realization stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The seventies,</v>

10
00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:50.600
<v Speaker 1>we really bought it again maybe just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a critical year or 18 months longer.</v>

11
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.370
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.710
<v Speaker 1>that's enough to kind of set the hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about a prolongation of</v>

13
00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>innocence of it's a prolongation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

14
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

15
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.300
<v Speaker 1>that's how I would describe the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there you are just so far from a</v>

16
00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>border or a coast that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.840
<v Speaker 1>the possibility of cynicism takes just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little longer when it hits,</v>

18
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.710
<v Speaker 1>it hits full force cause you'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace that cynicism and that irony in</v>

19
00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 1>that rage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 1>because you've been duped because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have survived to a greater age with your</v>

21
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>innocence and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you feel so betrayed by the world</v>

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>then that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>the first reaction is to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably cynical and hard.</v>

24
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is that kind of soft caramel</v>

25
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>center that never goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's just,</v>

26
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:43.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm just generalizing for myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

27
00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that I was an unbelievably</v>

28
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:48.730
<v Speaker 1>innocent 18 year old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 1>in every way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not stupid and not unaware of the</v>

30
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Justin some I somehow still thought</v>

31
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 1>it was a nice world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>freshman year at college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically I went to Philadelphia,</v>

33
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.891
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

34
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it was not Philadelphia's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love Philly.</v>

35
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't those other kids fault.</v>

36
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>They come from somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>tougher east coast schools.</v>

37
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of private school kids.</v>

38
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

39
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voltage between their jadedness and</v>

40
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.821
<v Speaker 1>my innocence was bound to make one of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy and it wasn't going to be them.</v>

41
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.290
<v Speaker 1>In some respects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's never really been ruined.</v>

42
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.433
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.080
<v Speaker 1>there's something about this whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrative that makes me uncomfortable</v>

44
00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>because I really don't truly don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in the midwestern ness of the</v>

45
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.070
<v Speaker 1>midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I cannot get outside it and account for</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

47
00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I believe it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

48
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>but it sort of like the center of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

49
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.793
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually know for sure that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

51
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a molten core.</v>

52
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm told we do and there's no reason to</v>

53
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:04.161
<v Speaker 1>doubt it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they've been,</v>

54
00:03:04.161 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>they've been there must be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:07.840
<v Speaker 1>and the Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Midwest,</v>

56
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the molten core of the country.</v>

57
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:11.360
<v Speaker 1>That must exist too.</v>

58
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Whenever</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone asks me to generalize about the</v>

59
00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Midwest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could want to come back and say,</v>

60
00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:24.470
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing as the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And every once in a while someone says,</v>

61
00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as the Midwest.</v>

62
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.850
<v Speaker 1>And then I want to argue with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>person and say that that's not true.</v>

63
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.790
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever watched a bit western or</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on the subway in New York City?</v>

64
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It was certainly true in my high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fashion's got there a year or two</v>

65
00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:42.080
<v Speaker 1>later than they did on the coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 1>what we thought was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cutting edge had,</v>

67
00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.680
<v Speaker 1>was already passe and in California and</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>

68
00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.210
<v Speaker 1>as I bitterly discovered when I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>east to go to college.</v>

69
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>So what that time lag represents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I just a midwestern values</v>

70
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>midwestern values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is such a thing as</v>

71
00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>midwestern values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of the crank capital of North</v>

73
00:04:12.201 --> 00:04:14.330
<v Speaker 1>America right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was wonderful,</v>

74
00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:17.060
<v Speaker 1>midwestern plain states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

75
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

76
00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.530
<v Speaker 1>what do you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.200
<v Speaker 1>it's no different from anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 1>and yet we all feel that there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something there.</v>
