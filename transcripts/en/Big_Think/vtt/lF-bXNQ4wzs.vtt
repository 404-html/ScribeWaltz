1
00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.990
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have anything to look up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anything to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the meaning that people find in</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives is purpose driven.</v>

4
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>And in order to put effort into</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.230
<v Speaker 1>to work towards something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to assume axiomatically that</v>

6
00:00:24.231 --> 00:00:27.350
<v Speaker 1>what you're working towards is better</v>
<v Speaker 1>than what you have because why else</v>

7
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>would you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a relationship,</v>

8
00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>like if it's way better than what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

9
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.890
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously proportionally difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you try to balance difficulty with,</v>

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>with positivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say something like that.</v>

11
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>But you're always aiming up if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>aiming and if you're not aiming,</v>

12
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>then you don't really have any purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that deprives your life of meaning.</v>

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if your life is deprived of</v>

14
00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what you're left with is the</v>

15
00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not neutral,</v>

16
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's negative.</v>

17
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>So now the problem with having to a mop</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that that produces a hierarchy,</v>

18
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Because if you pause it an aim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everyone a raise themselves along a</v>

20
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of better at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to worse at it,</v>

21
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't matter.</v>

22
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

23
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>if you create basketball as a game a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years later,</v>

24
00:01:18.741 --> 00:01:21.410
<v Speaker 1>you create people who are hyper</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized at basketball and they're</v>

25
00:01:21.411 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>great at it and virtually everyone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bad.</v>

26
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as you produced a value,</v>

27
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>a value proposition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you produce a hierarchy.</v>

28
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>The problem with the hierarchy is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces inequality.</v>

29
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.440
<v Speaker 1>The problem with inequality is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>produces resentment,</v>

30
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you can't get rid of the damn</v>

31
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy because they produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality and resentment because then</v>

32
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>you don't have anywhere to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's not an answer.</v>

33
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you're trying to deal with</v>

34
00:01:49.281 --> 00:01:51.380
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you have to put up with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

35
00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to have any values,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>how do you escape from the resentment</v>
<v Speaker 1>trap?</v>

37
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is you do an intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 1>multidimensional analysis of your life.</v>

38
00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.680
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time you're 30 I would say you're</v>

39
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>a pretty singular person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.103
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

41
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>you're unique in particular and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life has multiple dimensions and you're</v>

42
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>more or less successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not along many of those dimensions,</v>

43
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's completely ridiculous game to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick someone else arbitrarily who's</v>

44
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>doing much better than you on one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those dimensions,</v>

45
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>to assume that you're a failure because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that or that the world is unfair</v>

46
00:02:27.921 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without knowing in full detail all of</v>

47
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.890
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the elements of their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:33.891 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're absolutely the awash in stories of</v>

49
00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>unhappy celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] an interminable divorces or</v>
<v Speaker 1>an in affairs or in addictions or,</v>

51
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>and that's par for the course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful.</v>

52
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>It's helpful to have a goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary to have a hierarchy.</v>

53
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>It's not particularly useful to compare</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself to other people,</v>

54
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>but it is useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compare yourself to yourself.</v>

55
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>That's the right baseline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.490
<v Speaker 1>That's takes everything else into</v>
<v Speaker 1>account and,</v>

57
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's really practically useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

58
00:03:07.741 --> 00:03:10.000
<v Speaker 1>I've done this in my clinical practice</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frequently.</v>

59
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:10.511
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

60
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 1>let's take stock of where you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

61
00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>And then let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's hypothesize about where you would</v>

62
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>like to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a complex conversation,</v>

63
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because we want to figure out what's not</v>

64
00:03:20.051 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>so good about your present situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

65
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then come up with a hypothesis about</v>

66
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.090
<v Speaker 1>what your life would look like if it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

67
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And then we can work on incremental</v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

68
00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.170
<v Speaker 1>No idea would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some step you could take that</v>

69
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:40.171
<v Speaker 1>you would take that would make today or</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow fractionally better than</v>

70
00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

71
00:03:43.781 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And then you can iterate that and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually unbelievably powerful.</v>

72
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.840
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

73
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you hit the effect of compounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

74
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly if you do that.</v>

75
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 1>so there's real utility and incremental</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress and you don't have to improve</v>

77
00:03:57.701 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>your life much in increments to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting the effect of compounding</v>

78
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.820
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>you make one thing slightly better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that increases the probability that</v>

80
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you'll make the next things slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>better as well as having its positive</v>

81
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:13.000
<v Speaker 1>side effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>

82
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>even if you make small steps forward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do that regularly,</v>

83
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>that can turn your life around very</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly over like a one to two year</v>

84
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:20.980
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

85
00:04:20.981 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 1>that's a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one to two years.</v>

86
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 1>But it's not a lifetime and it certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>beats the hell out of going downhill</v>

87
00:04:26.171 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>precipitously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tends to be the alternative.</v>

88
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's better and it keeps you out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resentment,</v>

89
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

90
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>And it's also more realistic because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

91
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>it's not like everyone else doesn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their problems.</v>

92
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:42.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

93
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:47.441
<v Speaker 1>we have these fictitious successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that it's easy for us to compare</v>

94
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:51.580
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to detrimentally and to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>jealous and bitter about that,</v>

95
00:04:51.581 --> 00:04:54.520
<v Speaker 1>but also to be very hard on ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're not successful.</v>

96
00:04:54.521 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you talk to successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

97
00:04:58.391 --> 00:05:00.740
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to say that there's</v>

98
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.700
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as genuine accomplishment</v>
<v Speaker 1>because obviously there is,</v>

99
00:05:03.701 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>but people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even people who are successful have</v>

100
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.090
<v Speaker 1>lives that are very difficult and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

101
00:05:10.091 --> 00:05:10.924
<v Speaker 1>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 1>an ill family member or aged parents or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they're suffering from some serious</v>

103
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>illness themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

104
00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they have a psychological problem</v>

105
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>that's not trivial or they have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic past.</v>

106
00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like life is brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

107
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and becoming resentful about your</v>
<v Speaker 1>relative position is a way to make it</v>

108
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 1>more brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not helpful to you and it's not</v>

109
00:05:31.961 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 1>helpful to anyone else.</v>

110
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
