1
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.323
<v Speaker 1>When we look at the world's skills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest sources of it is us </v>

2
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>failing to do the right thing when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>the harder thing to do,</v>

3
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>giving into temptation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving into impulse,</v>

4
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.634
<v Speaker 1>giving into emotional sort of immediacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the part of the brain that's most </v>

5
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:25.254
<v Speaker 1>central to whether or not that happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the frontal cortex most recently </v>

6
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:30.324
<v Speaker 1>evolved part of the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got more of it proportionately or </v>

7
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>more complexly than any other primate </v>
<v Speaker 1>species out there.</v>

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the part of the brain that does </v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse control,</v>

9
00:00:38.971 --> 00:00:39.804
<v Speaker 1>longterm planning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emotional regulation does all the stuff </v>

10
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>where it's the frontal cortex that </v>
<v Speaker 1>whispers in your ear saying,</v>

11
00:00:46.951 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>do you really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really want to do that right now?</v>

12
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to regret it.</v>

13
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.240
<v Speaker 1>It seems like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frontal cortex about that.</v>

14
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.703
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when we look at our moments of life </v>

15
00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.703
<v Speaker 1>where there's that enormous temptation </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the impulsive thing and what's </v>

16
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:07.980
<v Speaker 1>going to determine whether the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be freed of impulsive horrors.</v>

17
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>If only we can all get stronger frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortices trained in childhood to be able</v>

18
00:01:13.711 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>to hold out where you can have one </v>
<v Speaker 1>marshmallow right now,</v>

19
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:17.994
<v Speaker 1>but if you wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get to later and training from </v>

20
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 1>early age so that your frontal cortex </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the most fabulous aerobic metabolism</v>

21
00:01:25.831 --> 00:01:26.664
<v Speaker 1>ever and it could just make you and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the studies suggest is at all sorts of </v>

22
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.530
<v Speaker 1>junctures of doing the harder thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

23
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>having a really robust studly frontal </v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex may do you a lot of good there,</v>

24
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>but when you do sort of the truly </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult thing,</v>

25
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:42.804
<v Speaker 1>when you see people who are the ones who</v>
<v Speaker 1>run into the burning building to save </v>

26
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.324
<v Speaker 1>the child in their leap into the river </v>
<v Speaker 1>when everybody else was standing there </v>

27
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>like headless chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at those people,</v>

28
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.583
<v Speaker 1>they're not doing it because they've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most amazing frontal cortex is on </v>

29
00:01:58.501 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

30
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>That could reason through the longterm </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of,</v>

31
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.603
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if nobody in society came to the </v>

32
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:04.794
<v Speaker 1>aid of strangers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they do is they do it </v>

33
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:07.794
<v Speaker 1>automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ask you ask anybody who does one of </v>

34
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:11.604
<v Speaker 1>these heroic acts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were you thinking when you jumped </v>

35
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.570
<v Speaker 1>in the river and the answer's always the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

36
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't thinking before I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had jumped in.</v>

37
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>When we do our most amazingly like </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondrous altruistic acts,</v>

38
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>it's not because we've got the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible frontal cortex is on earth.</v>

39
00:02:28.201 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>That could like reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's out of the realm where</v>

40
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:36.501
<v Speaker 1>the frontal cortex and it's out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realm of temptation and limbic stuff.</v>

41
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.673
<v Speaker 1>We do the harder thing in a case like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that because for us it's not the harder </v>

42
00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:41.574
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become automatic and that's where </v>

43
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the best success with temptation</v>

44
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:49.710
<v Speaker 1>when it isn't attempting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's automatic,</v>

45
00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.420
<v Speaker 1>when we've distracted ourselves.</v>

46
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>All of that frontal like work your way </v>
<v Speaker 1>through to the right decision gets you </v>

47
00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>only so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fabulous.</v>

48
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.544
<v Speaker 1>Study this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was work by a guy at Harvard named </v>

49
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.434
<v Speaker 1>Josh Green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who put people in a study in a brain </v>

50
00:03:04.991 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>scanner of some task where if they got </v>
<v Speaker 1>it right,</v>

51
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:09.874
<v Speaker 1>they get a reward afterward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so there's an incentive to get it </v>

52
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:13.504
<v Speaker 1>right and this wonderful manipulative </v>
<v Speaker 1>setup where at various points people </v>

53
00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.534
<v Speaker 1>were under the impression that there was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a glitch in the system and the computer </v>

54
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.564
<v Speaker 1>wasn't registering their answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all they had to do was think what </v>

55
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.744
<v Speaker 1>their answer was and then tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterward when they heard that the </v>

56
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>correct answer had they had the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer or not.</v>

57
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could cheat.</v>

58
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.713
<v Speaker 1>And what you would see is it was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>random task and most of the time people </v>

59
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:43.690
<v Speaker 1>were having about a 50 slash 50 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>success rate.</v>

60
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>And along comes the opportunities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheat.</v>

61
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>And if people's accuracy suddenly jumps </v>
<v Speaker 1>up at that point,</v>

62
00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.240
<v Speaker 1>uh Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how you detect a cheat or someone</v>

63
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.083
<v Speaker 1>who's long at that point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question becomes what's going on </v>

64
00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>with the brains of people who cheated at</v>
<v Speaker 1>those opportunities?</v>

65
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And what you saw was as soon as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>active came up,</v>

66
00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>their frontal cortex is activated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like mad.</v>

67
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:06.183
<v Speaker 1>They're wrestling with Satan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're wondering if they should do it </v>

68
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:09.754
<v Speaker 1>or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wondering if they should have </v>

69
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>done it the last time when they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

70
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:15.400
<v Speaker 1>They wondering if they're ever going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>their wrestling.</v>

71
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>All of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

72
00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:17.074
<v Speaker 1>so that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you look at the people who are </v>

73
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>cheating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity or otherwise never cheat.</v>

74
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on in them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've got the two models there.</v>

75
00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.790
<v Speaker 1>One of willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they've got frontal cortex,</v>

76
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.624
<v Speaker 1>is that could chest like be be stoic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>calvinist and gumption out the Wazoo </v>

77
00:04:36.701 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>

78
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.163
<v Speaker 1>Or is it a state of grace?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't cheat because you don't </v>

79
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.884
<v Speaker 1>cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the prediction there is if it's all </v>

80
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:45.154
<v Speaker 1>about willpower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as the opportunity to cheat </v>

81
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:47.794
<v Speaker 1>comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their frontal cortices are going to go </v>

82
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 1>through the roof in terms of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's a matter of grace,</v>

83
00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a matter of grace.</v>

84
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>The people who never cheated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't because they had the strong,</v>

85
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>strongest frontal cortex is it's because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't do that.</v>

86
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 1>It was that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a temptation,</v>

87
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.323
<v Speaker 1>and that's much more of a model of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a realm of just having to work </v>

88
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard to feel for somebody else or not</v>

89
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>pocket that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though nobody's looking,</v>

90
00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.410
<v Speaker 1>you just don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's automatic.</v>
