00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that is being overly</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic or if it is,</v>

2
00:00:15.941 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm right there.</v>

3
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of other people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about creativity,</v>

4
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.280
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just for the sake of art itself,</v>

5
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:27.190
<v Speaker 1>but creativity as a way of looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

6
00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:30.730
<v Speaker 1>looking at human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the world from a number of</v>

7
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 1>different angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

8
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we've seen from a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Obama's political utterances that I</v>

9
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:41.230
<v Speaker 1>think is very resonant with people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have sort of chosen the creative life</v>

10
00:00:41.231 --> 00:00:44.950
<v Speaker 1>and who find inspiration for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative life is that there's not one</v>

11
00:00:44.951 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many things are sometimes true at once.</v>

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>You can be in the midst of contradiction</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not have that be a stopping point,</v>

13
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>but rather be a weigh station on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>road forward.</v>

14
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>We've heard a lot of that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>language from him and I think that</v>

15
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>that's something certainly that great</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature tries to show us as well.</v>

16
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:05.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

17
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

18
00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:11.701
<v Speaker 1>to be American is not one thing to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>American is multi experiential,</v>

19
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>multilingual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is many,</v>

21
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:17.470
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many different aspects of the human</v>

22
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really part of what makes</v>

23
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.230
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion and incredibly interesting</v>

24
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>country with a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very vibrant arts scene.</v>

25
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is that essence that is not one</v>

26
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

27
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:32.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that,</v>

28
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comfort with contradiction is</v>

29
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 1>something that we've seen from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president as well.</v>

30
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>So I see that as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.810
<v Speaker 1>fertile ground for the area.</v>
