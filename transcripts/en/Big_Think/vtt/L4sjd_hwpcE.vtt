00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.060
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the funny thing is at one point</v>

2
00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>in time I would have really sought and</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>

3
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:14.270
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have really sought to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I identify with these set of people</v>

4
00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:19.100
<v Speaker 1>more that identity and what has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened when I've tried to do that has</v>

5
00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:20.450
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>being essentially slapped in the face</v>
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>

7
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>it's not that simple and it shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

8
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>that's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do try to simplify it,</v>

9
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>you're doing great harm to yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your understanding of the world.</v>

10
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>at this point in time I sort of put that</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the side and said,</v>

12
00:00:33.801 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the characterizations,</v>

13
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>the definitions are going to come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever it is that's going to,</v>

14
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want you to fall into particular</v>

15
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:44.420
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it for whatever purpose is going</v>

16
00:00:44.421 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to do that regardless of</v>

17
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:46.610
<v Speaker 1>what you say.</v>

18
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>So for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to create that open space for</v>

19
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.730
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that space is not one or the other.</v>

20
00:00:51.731 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>It will never be one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

21
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

22
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a space that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's infused with so many things.</v>

23
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>But I think what's great about that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well is that,</v>

24
00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

25
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 1>being Nigerian and being American rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you understand,</v>

26
00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you begin to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

27
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.491
<v Speaker 1>that it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

28
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:08.720
<v Speaker 1>it gets really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really absurd because of being American,</v>

29
00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:11.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is being influenced by so many different</v>

30
00:01:11.541 --> 00:01:13.880
<v Speaker 1>cultures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many different traditions that have</v>

31
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:15.550
<v Speaker 1>come into this country from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:15.551 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>whether they were here to start with or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they have come in through</v>

33
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:20.300
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

34
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being Nigerian is very much the same</v>

35
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:26.300
<v Speaker 1>because the idea of being Nigerian is</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenced by all the different groups</v>

36
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and cultures and subcultures that go on.</v>

37
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 1>And then you add to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a whole relation between Nigeria</v>

38
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK,</v>

39
00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:38.840
<v Speaker 1>which colonized in Nigeria and then now</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing connections between Nigeria and</v>

40
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>And American culture through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through hip hop music or</v>

42
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>films,</v>

43
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have come in and are now starting to</v>

44
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 1>influence the way that people think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea of what it means to be</v>

45
00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Nigerian is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

46
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>it's a very fractured thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

47
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:53.960
<v Speaker 1>it's a Malandra things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just,</v>

48
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.040
<v Speaker 1>it seems different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Because everybody in Nigeria tends to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have brown skin,</v>

50
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.220
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't necessarily mean everyone's</v>

51
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you see the differences more,</v>

52
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>

53
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>people like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

54
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.610
<v Speaker 1>to sort of smooth over that with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

55
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:08.930
<v Speaker 1>we're American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

56
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:10.580
<v Speaker 1>American again is so many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

57
00:02:10.581 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>

58
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>if I say I'm American,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean that I am,</v>

59
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 1>that means I've taken bits and pieces</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this.</v>

60
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I've taken bits and pieces from that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it into this identity.</v>

61
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.061
<v Speaker 1>So I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I'd say like for purposes of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of travel and characterization,</v>

63
00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have to show a passport,</v>

64
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I'll show which passport is most</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>

65
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes down to what I think I</v>
<v Speaker 1>am and how I perceive myself,</v>

66
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>acknowledging that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole,</v>

68
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 1>like a multiplicity of things allows me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to better relate to myself and to other</v>

69
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:44.240
<v Speaker 1>people and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to better deal with the world as a</v>

70
00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
