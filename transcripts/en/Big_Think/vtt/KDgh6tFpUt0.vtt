1
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.940
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that philosophy of science is at</v>

2
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.721
<v Speaker 1>its best and edits most exciting at</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical moments when it's not so easy</v>

3
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>to distinguish between,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>the activities of certain kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretical physicists and the</v>

5
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>activities of certain kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers.</v>

6
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

8
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>or at least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>let me back up a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's philosophy of science can be</v>

11
00:00:41.911 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>divided roughly into two different kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of activities.</v>

12
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>One is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>one is an activity of raising and</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigating general philosophical</v>

14
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:58.491
<v Speaker 1>questions about what science is about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether the claims of science to have</v>

15
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>some kind of privileged epistemic access</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world can be justified.</v>

16
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to systematize how science</v>

17
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to raise questions about</v>

19
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>whether we should trust the conclusions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of science.</v>

20
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>So on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are very broad,</v>

21
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 1>very traditionally philosophical kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of issues.</v>

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>There's another branch of philosophy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

23
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

24
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes up questions that arise within</v>

25
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>particular scientific theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theory of evolution,</v>

26
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>the theory of relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics and so on and so</v>

27
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:42.720
<v Speaker 1>forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually gets his hands dirty in the</v>

28
00:01:42.721 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>details of the structure of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific theories in order to try to</v>

29
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>help with problems that are often</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially scientific problems,</v>

30
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>but where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

31
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>but whose solution calls for an unusual</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree of sensitivity to philosophical</v>

32
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the second kind of work that,</v>

33
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 1>that my own work has mostly been in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the second kind of work that one</v>

34
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:10.440
<v Speaker 1>refers to when one refers to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>foundations of physics.</v>

35
00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:15.650
<v Speaker 1>There are problems about the logical</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure of physics,</v>

36
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>about the foundational assumptions that</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics makes,</v>

37
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>whether these problems properly belong</v>
<v Speaker 1>to physics,</v>

38
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>are they properly belong to philosophy</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the field is healthy?</v>

39
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>Isn't much of an issue.</v>

40
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 1>In my own case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my phd was in theoretical physics.</v>

41
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

42
00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I was a professor in physics departments</v>
<v Speaker 1>before being a professor in philosophy</v>

43
00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>departments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 1>when I write a paper now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my rule is that if at the end it has</v>

45
00:02:46.441 --> 00:02:49.950
<v Speaker 1>more than two equations in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I send it to a physics journal and if it</v>

46
00:02:49.951 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>has less than two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.560
<v Speaker 1>I send it to a philosophy journal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much more of a distinction</v>

48
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>than that when I attend conferences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are discussing the kinds of</v>

50
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>questions that I'm interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about half of the people speaking at</v>

51
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>these conferences are employed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics departments and half are</v>

52
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>employed in philosophy departments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not particularly easy to tell</v>

53
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>by listening to their talks what sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>department they're employed.</v>

54
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>And so philosophy of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I say,</v>

55
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>when it's healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a matter of focusing with a certain</v>

56
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:28.591
<v Speaker 1>level of philosophical sensitivity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication on questions at the</v>

57
00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>foundations of physics.</v>
