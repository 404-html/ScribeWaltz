1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Paul Haggis is a wonderful writer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Akiva Goldsman is another one,</v>

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a doctorate at Pixar,</v>

5
00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really have favorites and</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like rock and roll,</v>

7
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 2>it just isn't where you can pick a</v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite and,</v>

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see that they're doing something</v>

9
00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>really innovative in music and it comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every six months there's a song or album</v>

11
00:00:39.941 --> 00:00:44.941
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like that because the time</v>

12
00:00:45.131 --> 00:00:50.131
<v Speaker 2>between starting up a screenplay or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>novel or a play and actually seeing it</v>

13
00:00:50.981 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>on stage page or screen is years of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of uh,</v>

14
00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 2>of development and work and it goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm over long periods of time.</v>

15
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 2>And so it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>

16
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 2>there was a time back when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50,</v>

17
00:01:07.301 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 2>60 years ago when screenwriters were</v>
<v Speaker 2>under contract to studios and they were</v>

18
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 2>turning out three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

19
00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 2>five screenplays a year</v>
<v Speaker 2>and directors redirecting a two and</v>

20
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four films a year.</v>

21
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Michael Critias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who directed Casa Blanca by the time he</v>

22
00:01:24.041 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had directed a hundred and 20 films.</v>

23
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those days are gone.</v>

24
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.710
<v Speaker 2>If a director gets to direct 12 films in</v>
<v Speaker 2>his lifetime,</v>

25
00:01:32.711 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 2>you'd be a success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't,</v>

26
00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 2>you can't trace development and who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the cutting edge thing or whatever</v>

27
00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.240
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in it quite in those,</v>

28
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.170
<v Speaker 2>in those ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the three guys who write produce</v>

29
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 2>and often direct damages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

30
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.981
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

31
00:01:50.981 --> 00:01:53.380
<v Speaker 2>the two brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>allman brothers and Kessler,</v>

32
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 2>those three guys are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as doing as exciting,</v>

33
00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.890
<v Speaker 2>work as writers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as anybody in film.</v>

35
00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Film is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would film,</v>

36
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.270
<v Speaker 2>is very conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do not take risks.</v>

37
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.190
<v Speaker 2>Television is experimental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean watching the Sopranos,</v>

38
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:18.670
<v Speaker 2>whatever you and we're six feet under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

39
00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.650
<v Speaker 2>an example of applying to television,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the principle of the novel known as the</v>

41
00:02:23.651 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 2>unreliable narrator.</v>

42
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 2>You can never be sure when you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching the sopranos and six feet</v>

43
00:02:28.451 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 2>under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this a dream sequence?</v>

44
00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.400
<v Speaker 2>Is Somebody hallucinating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This just actually happened or they just</v>

45
00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 2>having fun with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's whatever.</v>

46
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>until you saw enough of the episode,</v>

47
00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 2>realize that the whole damned episode</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a dream.</v>

48
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does that film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that in the movies.</v>

49
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

50
00:02:48.481 --> 00:02:51.940
<v Speaker 2>it costs 30 slash 5,000 million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make a film.</v>

51
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 2>You can't have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have that kind of an</v>

52
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 2>experimentation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when it comes along,</v>

53
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 2>it went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When such experiments happen,</v>

54
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.724
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

55
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the usual suspects when somebody pulls</v>

56
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 2>the plug at the end and you realize</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Spacey made the whole damn thing</v>

57
00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

58
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.870
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

59
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.290
<v Speaker 2>a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a form of cheap surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big,</v>

62
00:03:17.741 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 2>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cheap surprise.</v>

63
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>It's not as if it was being done like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis Barnwell would have done in the</v>

64
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.921
<v Speaker 2>sixties to really express the absurdity</v>
<v Speaker 2>of life when,</v>

65
00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.650
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when film does tricky storytelling,</v>

66
00:03:32.651 --> 00:03:35.040
<v Speaker 2>things like that on occasion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

67
00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as if it's driven by a theme.</v>

68
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

69
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

70
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.960
<v Speaker 2>the six ads for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the mind fuck ending is just cheap</v>

71
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:51.721
<v Speaker 2>surprise is what film students do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not as if that filmmaker has a</v>

72
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.821
<v Speaker 2>deep philosophical understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a that runs against the grain of,</v>

73
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.620
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of contemporary,</v>

74
00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.950
<v Speaker 2>a sense of reality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

75
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.951
<v Speaker 2>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just having fun and I'm so he just</v>

76
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:12.590
<v Speaker 2>does this film school thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind fuck or whatever.</v>

77
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so and so film is very conservative in</v>

78
00:04:16.541 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

79
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 2>can't experiment like that or if it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent film,</v>

80
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 2>you could do films like Pie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no Aronofsky film,</v>

81
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which is extremely experimental for the</v>

82
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 2>sake of experimental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And these guys all went to film school</v>

83
00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:38.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

84
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 2>they were taught barnwell and truffaut</v>
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

85
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.250
<v Speaker 2>and the wash and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

86
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bergman and they went,</v>

87
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.330
<v Speaker 2>they were taught the classics of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Avant Garde.</v>

88
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.510
<v Speaker 2>And so they imitate what used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dangerous stuff in the sixties.</v>

89
00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

90
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

91
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

92
00:05:00.311 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

93
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>avant garde today.</v>

94
00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 2>It's a retro God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today we have people going back to</v>

95
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 2>imitating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

96
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eccentric forms of the past,</v>

97
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they went to film school and</v>

98
00:05:16.601 --> 00:05:18.610
<v Speaker 2>they think they should do that and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes them an artist.</v>

99
00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.280
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say that as a storytelling</v>

100
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>medium film in particular has had a dead</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

101
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.520
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

102
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very expensive.</v>

103
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 2>It's very conservative and</v>
<v Speaker 2>experimentation is,</v>

104
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there,</v>

105
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have more show off than meaningful</v>

106
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 2>gimmickry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

107
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.843
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

108
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 2>it's something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's got to give on what the hell</v>

109
00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 2>that will be a in order for film to</v>
<v Speaker 2>revive itself as an art form,</v>

110
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>as a form of entertainment in the form</v>
<v Speaker 2>of commerce,</v>

111
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>films doing than ever.</v>

112
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's such an,</v>

113
00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:03.800

114
00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:08.801
<v Speaker 2>generally unhappy topic</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've sold or optioned or been our role</v>

115
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>written for hire a 12 screenplays in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood.</v>

116
00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them I have option to four times</v>

117
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 2>over.</v>

120
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 2>none of them ever get produced a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all floundered for various</v>

121
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:35.201
<v Speaker 2>reasons to no less than three times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had studios change administrations</v>

122
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 2>in the middle of the development of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine.</v>

123
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

124
00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when a new a new presidents come in,</v>

125
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 2>they throw out everything that's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>development from the previous</v>

126
00:06:43.641 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 2>administration and the egos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

127
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 2>so one of those sad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a development hell stories,</v>

128
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>

129
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make money.</v>

130
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.733
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make,</v>

131
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 2>I made a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

132
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:58.070
<v Speaker 2>but you don't see it on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

133
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 2>everything I've written for television</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets made and shoveled a lot of episodic</v>

134
00:07:02.361 --> 00:07:03.194
<v Speaker 2>cop shows.</v>

135
00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 2>I watched the pilot for the Turner Bible</v>
<v Speaker 2>mini series.</v>

136
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:10.610
<v Speaker 2>I wrote to Abraham with the director by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joseph Sergeant,</v>

137
00:07:10.611 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 2>who's a wonderful Emmy award winning</v>
<v Speaker 2>director.</v>

138
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 2>It started Richard Harrison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barbara Hershey and Maximilian Shell.</v>

139
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.760
<v Speaker 2>find production.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when you write,</v>

141
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 2>when I've written for TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get made and uh,</v>

142
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 2>and they hold up there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good writing.</v>

143
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

144
00:07:28.011 --> 00:07:33.011
<v Speaker 2>screenplays a is the guild wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a study of how many of all these</v>

145
00:07:35.561 --> 00:07:40.070
<v Speaker 2>screenplays that get optioned a how many</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually see it to the screen.</v>

146
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 2>A four out of every 20 scripts for which</v>
<v Speaker 2>serious money is paid,</v>

147
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 2>one gets made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the age of 20 to one.</v>

148
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 2>So I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

149
00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 2>I've only right now it's only 12 to one</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me.</v>

150
00:07:52.611 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

151
00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

152
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's neither here nor there.</v>

153
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way it is.</v>

154
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.010
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.140
<v Speaker 2>just bad luck.</v>

156
00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.330
<v Speaker 2>But in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I was going through that period,</v>

157
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started to teach a writing about</v>

158
00:08:11.121 --> 00:08:16.121
<v Speaker 2>writing and writing about writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of them every time one of my</v>

159
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 2>writers wins an Oscar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a booker prize,</v>

160
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Apulia surprise and Emmy and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

161
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.730
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when or they call me and um,</v>

162
00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they tell me that,</v>

163
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.090
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>

164
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.080
<v Speaker 2>they got something published that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>unpublishable and then they came to my</v>

165
00:08:39.081 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 2>class,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did a rewrite and now it's,</v>

166
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in the world whether they win</v>

167
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 2>awards or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when,</v>

168
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:47.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people take what I teach them,</v>

169
00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:53.180
<v Speaker 2>think it through it all I try to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot teach people how to write.</v>

170
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Nobody can teach how to do anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

171
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:01.010
<v Speaker 2>I just give them things to think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want them to think the,</v>

172
00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.950
<v Speaker 2>I am categorically opposed to what I</v>
<v Speaker 2>call the Vesuvius School of writing</v>

173
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 2>where it's all magma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the writer just sits there and it</v>

174
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:13.800
<v Speaker 2>just explodes out of them.</v>

175
00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's sort of like automatic writing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just know.</v>

176
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

177
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 2>there are subconscious mind just</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that,</v>

178
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 2>that this ridiculous way of teaching</v>
<v Speaker 2>creative writing that there's no craft,</v>

179
00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 2>that there's no thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that there's no rewriting,</v>

180
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:29.010
<v Speaker 2>that there's no understanding by the</v>
<v Speaker 2>writer that it's all,</v>

181
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 2>some sort of innocent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spontaneous that is such idiocy.</v>

182
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

183
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't teach people how to write,</v>

184
00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.560
<v Speaker 2>but if I can give them things to think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about things to consider,</v>

185
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>elements of craft and um,</v>

186
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:46.590
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

187
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.700
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the process so that their work</v>

188
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:55.701
<v Speaker 2>improves and talented people think about</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing at some point in a</v>

189
00:09:56.491 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 2>way that is very useful to them as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>result of that.</v>

190
00:09:59.971 --> 00:10:03.750
<v Speaker 2>I put the idea in their head that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>are things that can be thought about.</v>

191
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.700
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

192
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.720
<v Speaker 2>and here's a way to think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't give you the answers.</v>

193
00:10:09.721 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 2>It just raises the right questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can get writers to ask the right</v>

194
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:18.651
<v Speaker 2>questions of their own work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>financers based upon insights that</v>

195
00:10:18.901 --> 00:10:20.910
<v Speaker 2>they've gained from my writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my lecturing,</v>

196
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

197
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.690
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my day is made.</v>

198
00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
