1
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 1>It is argued,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to like younger women tend to like</v>

2
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:19.460
<v Speaker 1>particular figures like large hips</v>
<v Speaker 1>visits that are good for childbearing</v>

3
00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>and large breasts that are good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>breastfeeding.</v>

4
00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and women tend to like strong,</v>

5
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>masculine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big shouldered men who can take care of</v>

6
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>their child and them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and there may be some truth to that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing.</v>

8
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

9
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.820
<v Speaker 1>it's too neat of a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of popular books written</v>

10
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lots of,</v>

11
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I teach undergraduates,</v>

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>they love those socio biological notions</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just a nice,</v>

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>neat little system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's too neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

15
00:00:50.491 --> 00:00:53.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it varies from culture to culture at</v>

16
00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>different points in our own culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:55.441 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 1>we've put on a pedestal more corpulent</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

19
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>n and D and cultures.</v>

20
00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect body style for a woman a is</v>

21
00:01:06.871 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>not the hourglass figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more of a,</v>

22
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>of a squat square figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

24
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 1>it's too easy for us to extrapolate from</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural,</v>

25
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>current cultural norms and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is some sort of evolutionary</v>

26
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>propensity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>there do seem to be more pairings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

28
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.340
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy men and younger,</v>

29
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.203
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

30
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which evolutionary theory would lead us</v>

31
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>to believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you also am always struck by a</v>

32
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>newspaper reports of older women going</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with younger men.</v>

33
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 1>And you see more and more of that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

34
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not at all what evolution would,</v>

35
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>would have his thing.</v>
