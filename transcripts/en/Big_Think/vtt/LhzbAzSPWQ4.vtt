1
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>Why superiors is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

2
00:00:10.951 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little like the waves of grief.</v>

3
00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>I think you have waves of awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.340
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things that I found with</v>
<v Speaker 1>grief was actually I was well,</v>

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.900
<v Speaker 1>well prepared for it by the cyclicity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my manic depressive illness and because</v>

6
00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>I was used to things coming and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that my awareness of having a</v>

8
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>bipolar is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.680
<v Speaker 1>have 17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got very,</v>

10
00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>very depressed and I was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I didn't have any energy and</v>

11
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:46.010
<v Speaker 1>it was totally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't have the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't talk about it at that</v>

13
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:51.210
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And people that certainly didn't have</v>

14
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>the words bipolar Ellis or manic</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressive poles.</v>

15
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>So I just was terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>I had no idea what had happened to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was very frightened and I was</v>

17
00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>frightened it would come back.</v>

18
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>But I got well and then I did what</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody or most people do when they</v>

19
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>get well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sort of put it behind me again and</v>

20
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>then it would come and hit me again and</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

21
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 1>And so I knew there was something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I started to see a psychiatrist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to see a psychiatrist when I was</v>

23
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:24.161
<v Speaker 1>in college and I ended up just running</v>
<v Speaker 1>away and I couldn't tolerate the idea of</v>

24
00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>but then when I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually got my degree and I,</v>

26
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.720
<v Speaker 1>I joined the medical school faculty at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ucla.</v>

27
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I became raving Lee Manic and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychotic and hallucinating,</v>

28
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 1>delusional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have any choice.</v>

29
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>And it was the gray.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the great advantage of having an</v>

30
00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>illness as severe as mine is that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>are automatically brought into the</v>

31
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>medical care system if you have until as</v>
<v Speaker 1>long as it was milder,</v>

32
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>I could kind of get by with actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to face what was the severity of</v>

33
00:01:59.031 --> 00:01:59.864
<v Speaker 1>my problem.</v>

34
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew the person I wanted to see.</v>

35
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.850
<v Speaker 1>It was somebody I had trained with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was my clinical supervisor and I had</v>

36
00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>seen him with patients and I had seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was tough and smart and</v>

37
00:02:11.481 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>compassionate and humanists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also new science and in medicine.</v>

38
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And so I went to him terrified and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just absolutely ferman his</v>

39
00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:22.940
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just never wavered.</v>

40
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just said that's the way it is.</v>

41
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>But he was kind about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't back off from it.</v>

42
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And he was a great psychotherapist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I've tried to</v>

43
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>do in my professional life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of my colleagues,</v>

44
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>is to emphasize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 1>medications just aren't enough for many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have these illnesses because</v>

46
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.460
<v Speaker 1>exactly what you're saying is how do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>become aware of an illness?</v>

47
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.670
<v Speaker 1>You become aware of an illness by</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding yourself and understanding</v>

48
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that that illness has in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own life symbolically and more</v>

49
00:02:57.591 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite literally.</v>

50
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.040
<v Speaker 1>I've primarily been in the psychotic</v>
<v Speaker 1>when manic,</v>

51
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not uncommon with mania.</v>

52
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>it's been mostly when I've been manic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a very exhilarating sort of</v>

54
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.210
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the hallucinations.</v>

55
00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went around the solar system,</v>

56
00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:24.920
<v Speaker 1>I went to Saturn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

57
00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:27.680
<v Speaker 1>in my mind's eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went through the star fields.</v>

58
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:29.060
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a glorious,</v>

59
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.660
<v Speaker 1>are ecstatic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is frequently the case with mania.</v>

60
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.370
<v Speaker 1>When you think about a lot of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious ecstasies is a very manic</v>

61
00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.380
<v Speaker 1>quality to that and a very grandiose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be very universal,</v>

62
00:03:42.381 --> 00:03:46.130
<v Speaker 1>cosmic related to everything's related</v>
<v Speaker 1>to everything.</v>

63
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also had some very bad ones.</v>

64
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.213
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm hallucinating myself is dead or as</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just covered with blood,</v>

66
00:03:56.751 --> 00:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean mania is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be as terrifying as it gets.</v>

67
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:04.130
<v Speaker 1>It is certainly as insane as one gas.</v>

68
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.190
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's frightening when it gets out of</v>

69
00:04:07.191 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are periods of mania where it</v>

70
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.230
<v Speaker 1>can be extremely attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

71
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:17.231
<v Speaker 1>probably true</v>
<v Speaker 1>in depression.</v>

72
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Your capacities you feel just flattens</v>
<v Speaker 1>and disappears and what you feel is</v>

73
00:04:23.821 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it kind of paint that you can't</v>

75
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 1>describe to anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he is,</v>

76
00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.960
<v Speaker 1>so it's an isolating pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can put the isolating pain.</v>

77
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's for people with bipolar roles in</v>

78
00:04:34.951 --> 00:04:36.360
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.340
<v Speaker 1>it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deadening,</v>

80
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lethargy in a coupled with an agitation</v>

81
00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>and restlessness at times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a sense of having no energy,</v>

82
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 1>no interest on no passion in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so for me,</v>

83
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 1>like everybody else who gets to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressing,</v>

84
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there comes a point when you say,</v>

85
00:04:58.591 --> 00:04:59.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

86
00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.890
<v Speaker 1>if I can't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I can't care,</v>

87
00:05:01.891 --> 00:05:03.630
<v Speaker 1>if I can't think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't concentrate,</v>

88
00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

89
00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>I can't read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

90
00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.620
<v Speaker 1>if I can't love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where am I?</v>

91
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Who is in there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the humanity?</v>

92
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.530
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

93
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:21.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain is agonal adjust is</v>

94
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 1>unrelenting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my case,</v>

95
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.910
<v Speaker 1>I had stopped my medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my looked at him and I gotten a wildly</v>

96
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 1>manic and then I got paralytics be</v>
<v Speaker 1>depressed for 18 months and there was</v>

97
00:05:31.501 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 1>not a time during those 18 months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember feeling okay.</v>

98
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>And at some point I tried to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

99
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>And I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to describe the kind of</v>

100
00:05:42.871 --> 00:05:45.600
<v Speaker 1>pain that goes on in severe depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's just,</v>

101
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 1>the words are not there.</v>
