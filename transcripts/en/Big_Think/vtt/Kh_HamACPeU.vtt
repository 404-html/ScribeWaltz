00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.543
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:08.803
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

3
00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.270
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

6
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

7
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>maybe because I don't think about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about it enough.</v>

8
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny because I now live in New</v>

9
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Jersey and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>I've just start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've just moved out there and I'm</v>

12
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.170
<v Speaker 1>experimenting with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

13
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>with the great commute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm taking a train from the outer</v>

14
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>still somewhat pastoral suburbs into</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan and on that train ride,</v>

15
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the towns of [inaudible] and far</v>

16
00:00:47.321 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking out the window the other</v>

17
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>day and I looked out the window and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're on the tops of this abandoned</v>

18
00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>line of telephone poles that were in</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the fields and,</v>

19
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>and the kind of no man's land of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>track on these abandoned telephone</v>

20
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>poles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which dated to probably around 1900</v>

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>where these gorgeous turquoise and jade</v>
<v Speaker 1>green colored glass insulators on the</v>

22
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Poles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these were what they used to,</v>

23
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect the wiring.</v>

24
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>Now these glass insulators stopped being</v>
<v Speaker 1>used in 1915,</v>

25
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:33.040
<v Speaker 1>1920 being actively made and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>switched into more one more modern</v>

26
00:01:33.041 --> 00:01:38.041
<v Speaker 1>materials to protect these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at this absolute,</v>

27
00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost,</v>

28
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it predates the machine age.</v>

29
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:44.560
<v Speaker 1>I looked at this glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these glass insulators,</v>

30
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 1>and I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been collecting them for years.</v>

31
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.370
<v Speaker 1>So to see them out the window still in c</v>
<v Speaker 1>two as they would say,</v>

32
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm still in their original,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:53.831 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>moment was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just so gratifying.</v>

34
00:01:57.281 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>And so it was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like the best moment of the week</v>

35
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>for me because although part of me wants</v>
<v Speaker 1>to now go out there and climb up the</v>

36
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.180
<v Speaker 1>telephone poles and like try and extract</v>
<v Speaker 1>them because I'm like,</v>

37
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one's using them.</v>

38
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>This is just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's no different than hunting for old</v>

39
00:02:10.031 --> 00:02:10.864
<v Speaker 1>bottles.</v>

40
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 1>I could be arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

41
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I've got to check with the local Amtrak</v>
<v Speaker 1>police there.</v>

42
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:24.410
<v Speaker 1>But I think the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that if you look at those insulators</v>

43
00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:29.411
<v Speaker 1>on those poles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you see how folks designed something</v>

44
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>truly beautiful to protect the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology of the time,</v>

45
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>there was this glass case that went over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones and it was a very about the</v>

46
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>function because they had to keep the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water out to stop the,</v>

47
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:43.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wires from corroding.</v>

48
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 1>But these are gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know folks out there who have</v>

49
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different examples of these glass,</v>

50
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>glass pieces.</v>

51
00:02:53.031 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 1>And so seeing something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an artifact from the early era,</v>

52
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>seeing that out in that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I love looking at a train because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>always looking at people's backyards.</v>

54
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And when you look out there and you see</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

55
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.270
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ornaments that served a function</v>

56
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>made me think about design again in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh way.</v>

57
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.070
<v Speaker 1>But maybe it made me want to just go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get them.</v>

58
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

59
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.750
<v Speaker 2>That's my style.</v>
