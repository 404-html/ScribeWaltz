00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been interested in writing online</v>

2
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>for some time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was</v>

3
00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:14.840
<v Speaker 1>an early participant in salons table</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk,</v>

4
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:19.841
<v Speaker 1>which was their forum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the section in 96 97 um,</v>

5
00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>because I just thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting that the readers could be</v>

6
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:28.700
<v Speaker 1>published in the same space as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers.</v>

7
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>That idea was intoxicating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I spent some time at Howard</v>

8
00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 1>Rheingold site mindstorms cause I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to check out a different environment for</v>

9
00:00:40.011 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>writing online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I didn't know anything about</v>

10
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 1>blogging because both those sites were</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced by people who kind of new code.</v>

11
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.810
<v Speaker 1>I didn't really know about blogging</v>
<v Speaker 1>until a student in one of my classes in</v>

12
00:00:55.251 --> 00:01:00.251
<v Speaker 1>2002 told me about it and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor rose and this is really up</v>

13
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:03.740
<v Speaker 1>your alley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he described his blog,</v>

14
00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:08.741
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't opinion block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a conservative undergraduate at</v>

15
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Nyu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously I minority,</v>

16
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 1>but he found in his opinion blog away to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make connections and the and have a</v>

17
00:01:15.951 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

18
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started telling me sort of how</v>

19
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>the blogging system worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember he said,</v>

20
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>if you get a link from a big blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get lots of readers.</v>

21
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:25.281
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:25.281 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>how many?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said five 10,000 and I found this</v>

23
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:34.631
<v Speaker 1>staggering because the leading quarterly</v>
<v Speaker 1>journals in my scholarly field,</v>

24
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:40.061
<v Speaker 1>if that wasn't the kind of writer I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be our like three thousand</v>

25
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.383
<v Speaker 1>four thousand readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

26
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And He's already telling me that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion blog can get five or 10</v>

27
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.430
<v Speaker 1>overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I didn't really understand what a</v>

28
00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>blog was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very interesting what he was</v>

29
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>telling me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he told me to go check out his blog</v>

30
00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.760
<v Speaker 1>and insta pundit.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was very intrigued by what he had</v>

31
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 1>told me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started walking back to my office.</v>

32
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:07.670
<v Speaker 1>By the time I got close to my office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was closer to a running because I</v>

33
00:02:07.671 --> 00:02:11.870
<v Speaker 1>just had this sense that I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what it was.</v>

34
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>And I remember logging in and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>instant money and I didn't understand</v>

35
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>what it was because I was looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface of the blog without</v>

36
00:02:22.401 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>understanding the blog is fear behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

37
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>But once I did everything that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been kind of wrestling with since table</v>

38
00:02:31.731 --> 00:02:36.731
<v Speaker 1>talk and mindstorms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized it's here.</v>

39
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self publishing is here.</v>

40
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>That's a long revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Self publishing,</v>

41
00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.550
<v Speaker 1>that's a 300 year event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 1>It's to the point where the capital</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to be a publisher has gone down</v>

43
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>almost to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a 300 year event,</v>

44
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a 500 year flood,</v>

45
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>so media time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like a thousand year flood.</v>

46
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.970
<v Speaker 1>So I took a year to study blogging from</v>
<v Speaker 1>2002 to 2003 and the reasons I wanted to</v>

47
00:03:12.911 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're about five.</v>

48
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.710
<v Speaker 1>The main one was I wanted to have my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine with no editor to tell me what</v>

49
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>a valid idea about the press and media</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

50
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to completely evade the</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing editorial system because</v>

51
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>frankly it had kept me in a very limited</v>
<v Speaker 1>state of expression for a long time.</v>

52
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>There's only so much that I could say if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to publish a Columbia</v>

53
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 1>journalism review article,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I wanted to write in a hot bed for</v>

54
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>the Los Angeles Times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I did.</v>

55
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And it was just the frustration with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>limited range of,</v>

56
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 1>of terms and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very stunted imaginary of the press</v>

57
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>about itself was the main reason I</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to have a blog,</v>

58
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>which I conceived of as my own one</v>
<v Speaker 1>person magazine,</v>

59
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>which is still my description of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>press thing is.</v>

60
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to go around the gatekeepers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted to know what was happening</v>

61
00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.120
<v Speaker 1>in this field because I was pretty sure</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as I understood the self</v>

62
00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>publishing is here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was going to have major</v>

63
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>consequences for professional</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalism.</v>

64
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>So I wanted to know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also wanted to catch up to,</v>

65
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.290
<v Speaker 1>as it were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where my students were,</v>

66
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this student was a little bit ahead</v>

67
00:04:23.231 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the crowd,</v>

68
00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>but he was definitely pointing me</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards something that would connect me</v>

69
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>to my students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

70
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.630
<v Speaker 1>and I wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>a platform to address both professional</v>

71
00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I've been talking to for a while and</v>

72
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:45.931
<v Speaker 1>my earlier work and this new class of</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential journalist that I saw a rising</v>

73
00:04:47.561 --> 00:04:50.490
<v Speaker 1>up also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

74
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 1>I have a phd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did my dissertation on the whole idea</v>

75
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:59.641
<v Speaker 1>of the public as this thing on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>receiving and of the press.</v>

76
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>That was what my research was about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I say this is a 300 year of men,</v>

77
00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.840
<v Speaker 1>it comes out of that because what</v>
<v Speaker 1>blogging means is that the self</v>

78
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.820
<v Speaker 1>publishing public is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>a lead and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of the press belongs to those</v>

80
00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 1>who own one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>what I said was blogging means anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>can own one.</v>

82
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>That was exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was something I had to be in on.</v>

83
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And I knew by the end of that afternoon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to have a blog.</v>
