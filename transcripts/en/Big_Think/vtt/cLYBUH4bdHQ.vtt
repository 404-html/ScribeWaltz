00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.590
<v Speaker 1>In respect of many of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological projects of mortality,</v>

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.430
<v Speaker 1>what survives is not the person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants lived</v>

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.013
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.540
<v Speaker 1>a coach wiles version as I understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

5
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is proposed is that elements of the</v>

6
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious self of the people</v>

7
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:26.121
<v Speaker 1>concerned are somehow a programmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>computed and then projected into</v>

8
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:32.390
<v Speaker 1>cyberspace where that self aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>mind can create a variety of bodies for</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself in a virtual environment.</v>

10
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>So rather than having the one frail</v>
<v Speaker 1>aging vulnerable,</v>

11
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>a body that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of us have to start with,</v>

12
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people can have a whole variety of</v>

13
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>different bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different genders when they get bored</v>

14
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>with them or want to change them for</v>
<v Speaker 1>other reasons,</v>

15
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>they can have as many as they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My objection is that what would have,</v>

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I would not be the person because first</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all,</v>

17
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>it would only be the parts of the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are conscious and can be</v>

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.824
<v Speaker 1>programmed.</v>

19
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.920
<v Speaker 1>And my view is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>the larger part of each of us and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>large part of where our creativity,</v>

21
00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>in our lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from both artistic and</v>

23
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.640
<v Speaker 1>intellectual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creativity is not conscious.</v>

24
00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

25
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>it's in part of ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not accessible to conscious</v>

26
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I'm a,</v>

27
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my conscious life,</v>

28
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>my conscious intellectual life is</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow had coded and encrypted and then</v>

29
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:42.081
<v Speaker 1>projected into a virtual afterlife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the will be out there will be a</v>

30
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>sort of thinned out cartoon of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>

31
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>a thinned out image of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the whole person I once was,</v>

32
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not interested in that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality.</v>

33
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't accept it if I were offered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>offered it.</v>

34
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might very well except an extension of</v>

35
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:04.260
<v Speaker 1>long get of healthy longevity of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind that Aubrey degrade talks about.</v>

36
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're already living longer and</v>

37
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>healthier than many previous human</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations did.</v>

38
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I see nothing inherently wrong with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

39
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>but indefinite longevity is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>immortality and it's not the kind of</v>

40
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:21.951
<v Speaker 1>radical freedom from bodily frailty that</v>
<v Speaker 1>future as such as Kurtzweil want.</v>
