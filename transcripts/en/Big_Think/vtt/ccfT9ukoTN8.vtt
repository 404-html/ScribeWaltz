00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Every retail sales person in America</v>
<v Speaker 1>just secretly wants to get through life</v>

2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>without ever being accused of being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushy salesperson.</v>

3
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the man in the desert story,</v>

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

6
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>there's a silly a story in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>until I made it up because it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>silly,</v>

8
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>but the guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy lives on an oasis in the desert</v>

9
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:26.691
<v Speaker 1>and he looks out one day and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man that's been obviously stranded in</v>

10
00:00:27.331 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>the desert for days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

12
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.750
<v Speaker 1>kind of approaching a serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approaching death or something.</v>

14
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.773
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens in retail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the retail industry is people rush up</v>

16
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>to him and give him a glass of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

17
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he drinks the water and they pat</v>

18
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves on the back and the man of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert wanders off some more and</v>

19
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they're feeling great about themselves.</v>

20
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

21
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>I got the guy a glass of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we,</v>

22
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>there's so much more that you can do for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

23
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>You need to intuit his needs and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

24
00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needs more than water.</v>

25
00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>He's been out there for days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs food.</v>

26
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might need electrolytes,</v>

27
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.540
<v Speaker 1>not just a water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's give him some gatorade or you</v>

28
00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs to call his family and let them</v>

29
00:01:12.961 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>know that he's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not to mention Aloe Vera and all of</v>

31
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're really the man in the desert.</v>

32
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>You're fulfilling his needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intuiting is nice and filling them,</v>

33
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through conversation and through it's</v>

34
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:27.420
<v Speaker 1>hard work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:28.191
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

36
00:01:28.191 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing all of that.</v>

37
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Then you can feel good about yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man and desert puts the moral imperative</v>

38
00:01:33.931 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on selling rather than not selling</v>

39
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>somebody that really understands the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain desert.</v>

40
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.990
<v Speaker 1>A story will understand that I'm selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>and service for the same thing.</v>

41
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>We're not training people to sell up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell this.</v>

42
00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Just help them in the true sense of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>word.</v>

43
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Just help the customer and the true</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of the word.</v>

44
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only help the customer and help</v>

45
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>the company or you can hurt the customer</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hurt the company if you went out and</v>

46
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>give them a glass of water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're just kind of wimping out</v>

47
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>because you're afraid of being seen as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushy salesperson.</v>

48
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You're hurting the customer and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hurting the company.</v>

49
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>So if there's a woman in the container</v>
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>

50
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>closet section and she's got a tie rack</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one hand in a shoe rack and the other</v>

51
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean she obviously has a closet</v>

52
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that's driving her crazy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can conclude that fairly safely</v>

53
00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>and if you let her get out of there with</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two items,</v>

54
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>she's still got to have a closet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was driving her crazy,</v>

55
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.290
<v Speaker 1>but the ties and the shoes will be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit better off,</v>

56
00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>which you can do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.910
<v Speaker 1>causing interaction with her to find it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

58
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 1>and take a complete closet approach to</v>
<v Speaker 1>really kind of redoing her whole closet.</v>

59
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And what that will usually lead up to is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a customer that's vastly happier because</v>

60
00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>she got a problem solved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She got her car and she's dancing in the</v>

61
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>closet because it's so perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're trying to get.</v>

62
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to get what we call the</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer dance.</v>

63
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Then you have a really delighted</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer who's coming back quickly who's</v>

64
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>so delighted with her closet that she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing,</v>

65
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her sister in law and her next door</v>

66
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>neighbor that closet and then they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in because they want,</v>

67
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>they want that feeling too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like emotionally thrilled</v>

68
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>with this closet or pantry or toys</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards solution or whatever.</v>

69
00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we build our business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old market or a new market.</v>

70
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.690
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately what people want is they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to feel emotional about the brands,</v>

71
00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.630
<v Speaker 1>about the prototype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this stuff home.</v>

72
00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>And they live with it for a very long</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and they either cus you every time</v>

73
00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>they see it or they smile and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

74
00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 1>very happy about it.</v>

75
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>So we talk about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get people to be emotional even</v>

76
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>about something as pedestrian as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trashcan.</v>

77
00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.190
<v Speaker 1>We probably have the world's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have the world's best</v>

78
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>selection of trash cans and even a trash</v>
<v Speaker 1>can can make you smile if you have this</v>

79
00:03:56.411 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>man in the desert interaction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer and salesperson.</v>

80
00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 1>She's got a lacquer trash cans so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it fits in that corner perfectly.</v>

81
00:04:03.641 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>You love the way the pedal opens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>closes,</v>

82
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.760
<v Speaker 1>closes you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually kind of proud of your</v>

83
00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:10.600
<v Speaker 1>trash can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

84
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.890
<v Speaker 1>you've considered showing it off to</v>
<v Speaker 1>house gifts that you have over it stuff</v>

85
00:04:14.891 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>and proudly saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

86
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that's my trash can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about,</v>

87
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my trashcan,</v>

88
00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.850
<v Speaker 1>and that's man in the desert selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just trying to help her figure</v>

89
00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>out what she needs to feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

90
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 1>people want emotion.</v>
