00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.920
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting because I have</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with both chimpanzees and</v>

2
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>dolphins and they're both incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent,</v>

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.510
<v Speaker 1>complex beings and it is difficult to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say who is more intelligent.</v>

4
00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get to the level of working</v>

5
00:00:24.801 --> 00:00:29.560
<v Speaker 1>with an animal of that complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to,</v>

6
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>to rank them or to say who is more</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent than who,</v>

7
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to read chimpanzees because</v>

8
00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:40.880
<v Speaker 1>they look like us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're our closest living relatives and</v>

9
00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.480
<v Speaker 1>their body language and facial</v>
<v Speaker 1>expressions are very much like ours.</v>

10
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>It's more difficult to read dolphins</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have facial</v>

11
00:00:49.011 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>expressions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't look like us.</v>

12
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.251
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

13
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:57.251
<v Speaker 1>so there is a difference in how we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceive their intelligence.</v>

14
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>But I would have to say that having</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with both,</v>

15
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they are a strikingly a bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both of them.</v>
