<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>management is focused on efficiency and</v>

2
00:00:14.691 --> 00:00:19.691
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leadership is focused on adjusting the</v>

3
00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long term goals,</v>

4
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what are the B I and they were both,</v>

5
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really are three categories.</v>

6
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>They are both distinguished dramatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>from administration.</v>

7
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>So there's really administer</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration,</v>

8
00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:40.400
<v Speaker 1>management and leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just leadership and management.</v>

9
00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And an awful lot of our people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including many of our people in top</v>

10
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 1>offices are extremely confused about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and have administration all</v>

11
00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>confused with management and leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a big problem that we have</v>

12
00:00:55.251 --> 00:00:56.084
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

13
00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
