1
00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to disentangle,</v>

3
00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>but you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think about it,</v>

4
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.510
<v Speaker 1>think about it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two ways.</v>

5
00:00:16.511 --> 00:00:21.511
<v Speaker 1>One is there's almost nothing done in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington d C or on the campaign trail</v>

6
00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>without the media involved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 1>so that the media is constantly on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind of every politician and</v>

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.060
<v Speaker 1>policymaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second way to think about it is that</v>

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.560
<v Speaker 1>the media both reflects and shapes any</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy debate.</v>

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.250
<v Speaker 1>So in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some cases that the framing,</v>

11
00:00:39.251 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>the presentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an issue with in the news,</v>

13
00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflects how strategists are pushing</v>

14
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:50.710
<v Speaker 1>certain packages or a strategic</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations into the media coverage</v>

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 1>or the nature of the debate that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in Congress.</v>

16
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>At other times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something will appear in the media</v>

17
00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>around a focusing event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say a natural disaster or a new</v>

18
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:02.170
<v Speaker 1>scientific moment or a will come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new interpretation.</v>

19
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes journalists are kind of issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs onto themselves.</v>

20
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>They're actually pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>a certain direction or a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>re-interpretation on policies.</v>

22
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>And Your Times magazine article is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good example.</v>

23
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so in some cases the media can then</v>

24
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.120
<v Speaker 1>start a new narrative in the policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>

25
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.560
<v Speaker 1>a new frame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but really you can think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling media,</v>

27
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes on in an election,</v>

28
00:01:26.891 --> 00:01:28.390
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes on in Washington</v>
<v Speaker 1>DC.</v>

29
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally it comes down to first</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlling an attention,</v>

30
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>how much attention in issue receives in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the press and then when it does receive</v>

31
00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:39.790
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's it defined or how is it framed?</v>

32
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

33
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest challenge facing</v>
<v Speaker 1>science institutions today is the</v>

34
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.590
<v Speaker 1>problem of choice in the media system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>so you can pray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can produce great scientific content</v>

36
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.850
<v Speaker 1>and produce really great science media</v>
<v Speaker 1>coverage of the New York Times coverage</v>

37
00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.970
<v Speaker 1>on pbs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in most parts in those outlets,</v>

38
00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:05.120
<v Speaker 1>you're probably only reaching an</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience who already agrees with you and</v>

39
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>is already well informed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the American public,</v>

40
00:02:08.421 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>they have so many media choices that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lack of preference or interest in</v>

41
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>science content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can completely avoid that really</v>

42
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:17.960
<v Speaker 1>good coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the challenge then is to try to</v>

43
00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:19.460
<v Speaker 1>figure out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

44
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>ways to what I call incidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expose that wider public,</v>

45
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>the science content to get them science</v>
<v Speaker 1>information and places in the media</v>

46
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>where they're not looking for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes that's in celebrity news</v>

47
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>coverage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that that's at a religious new</v>
<v Speaker 1>site.</v>

49
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's in late night comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the daily show,</v>

50
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infotainment entertainment,</v>

51
00:02:42.531 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>sometimes that's on the business beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>because many people that read the</v>

52
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:48.530
<v Speaker 1>business pages are not interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>science or not also recent reading the</v>

53
00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>pages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.400
<v Speaker 1>but if you can get coverage of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business beat,</v>

56
00:02:52.401 --> 00:02:53.900
<v Speaker 1>now you're reaching an important</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>

57
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you have to figure out a way that,</v>

58
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where can you accidentally reach your</v>

59
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incidentally reached the intended</v>

60
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>audience that you're trying to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then second,</v>

61
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>that's the channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to figure out,</v>

62
00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the message that fits with that</v>

63
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that area of the media and also the</v>

64
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>audience that's consuming that media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

65
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where you,</v>

66
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.740
<v Speaker 1>that's where you do the research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>on how to frame a present that complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>information in a way that's</v>

68
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>understandable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assessable and connects to something</v>

69
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>that people already know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
