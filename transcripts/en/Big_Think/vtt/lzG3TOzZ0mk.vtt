1
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>And I don't really worry about to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what they think,</v>

2
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to make a living.</v>

3
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Transcendental meditation is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular</v>

4
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>form of mantra meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are many that allows your mind</v>

5
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:35.991
<v Speaker 1>to experience progressively abstract</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields of awareness and ultimately just</v>

6
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>settled out in the space between your</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts.</v>

7
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.230
<v Speaker 1>The space between your thoughts is pure</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

8
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a field of possibilities is a field</v>

9
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>of creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a field of correlation.</v>

10
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It's also feel the one certainty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a field where intention</v>

11
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>actualizes it's own fulfillment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that meditation allows you to contact</v>

12
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 1>this field which is very primordial the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground state of our existence</v>

13
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>according to our current understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

14
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 2>king</v>

15
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physical universe is actually made</v>

16
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>up of energy and information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wherever there are objects,</v>

17
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>there are fields of energy and also have</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflammation.</v>

18
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you go to the very fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels of activity in nature,</v>

19
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.820
<v Speaker 1>you find that nature is a discontinuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which means even though our perceptual</v>

20
00:01:42.271 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>experience of the universe is that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuous,</v>

21
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.720
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going on and off at the speed of</v>

22
00:01:48.721 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know what's in the honor of the</v>

23
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:53.760
<v Speaker 1>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's energy and information and we use</v>

24
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>it in our technology when we use cell</v>
<v Speaker 1>phones yourself,</v>

25
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.370
<v Speaker 1>the information highway on the internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>or cell or send each other email,</v>

26
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>but the deeper question is what in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

27
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>what's between the two aunts in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>discontinuity and many people in quantum</v>

28
00:02:13.171 --> 00:02:18.171
<v Speaker 1>physics in the world of quantum physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>or realizing or thinking or</v>

29
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 1>hypothesizing that the discontinuity is</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness itself.</v>

30
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Speaker 1>That consciousness is not a byproduct of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution as has been suggested or for</v>

31
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An expression of our brains or the itch</v>

32
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:42.171
<v Speaker 1>expresses itself through our brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That consciousness is the common ground</v>

33
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>of existence that ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiate into space,</v>

34
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

35
00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>information and matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same consciousness is</v>

36
00:02:51.811 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>responsible for our thoughts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our emotions and feelings,</v>

37
00:02:56.131 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>for our behaviors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our personal relationships,</v>

38
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:04.930
<v Speaker 1>for a social interactions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the environments that we find</v>

39
00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>ourselves in and for our biology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

40
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is the ground of being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>differentiates into everything that we</v>

41
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 1>call reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the observer and the objects</v>

42
00:03:16.901 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>of observation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a much deeper understanding</v>

43
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:26.611
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness that is coming about as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of some insights from the world</v>

44
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:33.511
<v Speaker 1>of quantum physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone agrees on this theory.</v>

45
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of scientists are still tied to</v>

46
00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>the old paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that matter is the essential</v>

47
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>reality and that consciousness is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>epi phenomenon.</v>

48
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.960
<v Speaker 1>But it turns out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>even to explain simple things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you perceive color?</v>

50
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>How do you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you see pictures in</v>

51
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>consciousness?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sounds in consciousness?</v>

52
00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to recognize that this can not</v>
<v Speaker 1>be explained by any reductionist model.</v>

53
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>When you experience a sound or a color</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a taste or a smell,</v>

54
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>the activity in your brain is just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of charges that goes on and off.</v>

55
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>How does that code of charges going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and off become physical reality?</v>

56
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 1>And where does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 1>if we understand this model of quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>

58
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.430
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes apparent that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>we're not in the physical world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physical world is in us.</v>

60
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>We create the physical world and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we perceive it,</v>

61
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>when we observe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also we create it's experienced in</v>

62
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:48.121
<v Speaker 1>our imagination and when I say we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mean the physical body or the</v>

63
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that deeper domain of consciousness</v>

64
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 1>which conceives governance constructs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and actually becomes everything that we</v>

65
00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.820
<v Speaker 1>call physical reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a model that is being explored</v>

66
00:05:00.821 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>by some cutting edge scientists both in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field of neuroscience and also in</v>

67
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the field of quantum physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it is also a model that was explored</v>

68
00:05:09.701 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 1>by the great sages and seers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whom were the authors of the</v>

69
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.243
<v Speaker 1>Bhagavad Gita itself.</v>

70
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>My medical training was in the field of</v>
<v Speaker 1>internal medicine and then in the field</v>

71
00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>of endocrinology and neuroendocrinology</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroendocrinology.</v>

72
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:32.011
<v Speaker 1>The study of brain chemicals and brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemicals are the mechanics through</v>

73
00:05:32.861 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>which our thoughts express ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a thought or feeling or</v>

74
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>an emotion or an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you make have a specific chemical.</v>

75
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>It's called neuropeptide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these neuropeptides are messenger</v>

76
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>molecules that then go to the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body and influence the activity of</v>

77
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually almost every biological</v>

78
00:05:55.241 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>activity in the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your body,</v>

79
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.540
<v Speaker 1>which is very physical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is under the influence of your thoughts,</v>

80
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 1>your feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your emotions,</v>

81
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 1>your dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your fantasies,</v>

82
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>your desires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your instincts,</v>

83
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 1>your drives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your imagination.</v>

84
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.460
<v Speaker 1>All these things orchestrate themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these internal activities that occur</v>

85
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.250
<v Speaker 1>in the invisible domain that we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness actually have very precise</v>

86
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.380
<v Speaker 1>physical effects both in our biology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they also influence our perception</v>

87
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:27.464
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

88
00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the years I've looked at the</v>

89
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.390
<v Speaker 1>biological markers of aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these include things like blood</v>

90
00:06:39.391 --> 00:06:40.800
<v Speaker 1>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bone density,</v>

91
00:06:40.801 --> 00:06:43.380
<v Speaker 1>body temperature regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

92
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 1>skin thickness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of wrinkles,</v>

93
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.680
<v Speaker 1>immune function,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex hormone levels.</v>

94
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm hearing vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a number of ways you can</v>

95
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:58.980
<v Speaker 1>measure what we call biological aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's something called</v>

96
00:06:58.981 --> 00:07:03.030
<v Speaker 1>chronological aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a direct reflection of when you</v>

97
00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:04.860
<v Speaker 1>were born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the date you were born,</v>

98
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.870
<v Speaker 1>and then there's psychological age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is how a young you feel</v>

99
00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 1>psychologically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is more and more data that the</v>

100
00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:19.800
<v Speaker 1>biological markers of aging are more</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the influence of psychological</v>

101
00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:24.750
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the chronological age that we</v>

102
00:07:24.751 --> 00:07:26.940
<v Speaker 1>usually associate with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

103
00:07:26.941 --> 00:07:29.730
<v Speaker 1>there are other things that influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>our aging process,</v>

104
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>including how we perceive time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're constantly running out of</v>

105
00:07:36.091 --> 00:07:38.250
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your biological clock speeds up</v>

106
00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:42.720
<v Speaker 1>when you do run out of time with a heart</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack or something like that.</v>

107
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of our self esteem</v>

108
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 1>determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we age our perception of our bodies,</v>

109
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fields of energy or as fields of</v>

110
00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:59.970
<v Speaker 1>matter influence how our body ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are many other things,</v>

111
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
<v Speaker 1>the quality of our rest as in sleep or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of our ability to manage</v>

112
00:08:07.981 --> 00:08:12.660
<v Speaker 1>stress as through meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical exercise,</v>

113
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.790
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>body coordination,</v>

114
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 1>through techniques such as yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 1>breathing and martial arts.</v>

115
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of our relationships,</v>

116
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:26.670
<v Speaker 1>whether we have toxic relationships or</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing relationships,</v>

117
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:32.210
<v Speaker 1>the quality of our emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toxic emotions or emotions that,</v>

118
00:08:32.281 --> 00:08:33.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.840
<v Speaker 1>foster connectivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these all influence how we age aging is</v>

120
00:08:41.011 --> 00:08:44.910
<v Speaker 1>subject to revision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to have somebody who's</v>

121
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:48.900
<v Speaker 1>chronologically 80 but could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologically 65.</v>

122
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.390
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have somebody who's</v>

123
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.560
<v Speaker 1>chronologically 25 and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically and mentally burned out of</v>

124
00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.620
<v Speaker 1>their biological age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe much older are the fastest growing</v>

125
00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:05.901
<v Speaker 1>segment of the population in the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now is over the age of 90 and in</v>

126
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:09.150
<v Speaker 1>some cases or the age of 100 and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

127
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:14.780
<v Speaker 1>so people are living longer and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though much of it as attribute it to</v>

128
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.310
<v Speaker 1>modern medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

129
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>It's lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's nutrition is the quality of</v>

130
00:09:21.961 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to manage stress and some of</v>

131
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the factors that have made</v>

132
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:27.763
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

133
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody has a role in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>own aging.</v>

134
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Some people accelerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people a slow it down,</v>

135
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:43.270
<v Speaker 1>some people manage to reverse it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on how much you are</v>

136
00:09:45.021 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 1>invested in the hypnosis of social</v>
<v Speaker 1>conditioning,</v>

137
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.450
<v Speaker 1>so if you believe that it's certain age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to retire and become</v>

138
00:09:53.451 --> 00:09:58.451
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional than you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I do is mostly creativity.</v>

139
00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:08.470
<v Speaker 1>I think a creativities and the static</v>
<v Speaker 1>impulse that we all have and there's</v>

140
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.960
<v Speaker 1>nothing more joyful than having a moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creative insight and then actually</v>

141
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:21.430
<v Speaker 1>creating a or rather manifesting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>incarnating your creative insight into</v>

142
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:28.630
<v Speaker 1>actual physical reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The struggle is part of the creative</v>

143
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>process and it's very enjoyable to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to struggle without the struggle.</v>

144
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:41.450
<v Speaker 1>There will be no joy and creativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that is not enjoyable is</v>

145
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:46.581
<v Speaker 1>that if you get attached to the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're constantly looking for</v>

146
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>approval and you are not immune to</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism,</v>

147
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:58.710
<v Speaker 1>then you are in trouble and you'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to be struggling and never find</v>

148
00:10:58.711 --> 00:10:59.544
<v Speaker 1>the creativity</v>

149
00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:09.390
<v Speaker 1>run through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my work are that consciousness is</v>

150
00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that by understanding consciousness,</v>

151
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>you understand everything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

152
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>about perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about creativity,</v>

153
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>about behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about relationships.</v>

154
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.870
<v Speaker 1>So by understanding God's justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the ability to create anything</v>

155
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 1>in your world and you have the ability</v>
<v Speaker 1>to influence also the collective</v>

156
00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:35.160
<v Speaker 1>consciousness to not only bring about</v>
<v Speaker 1>personal healing,</v>

157
00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 1>but social transformation and ultimately</v>
<v Speaker 1>healing our planet,</v>

158
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.820
<v Speaker 1>which happens to me extremely wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the upanishads,</v>

159
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 1>in which includes the Bhagavad Gita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say no,</v>

160
00:11:47.671 --> 00:11:50.280
<v Speaker 1>that one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by knowing which everything else is not,</v>

161
00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 1>and that one thing is fine.</v>
