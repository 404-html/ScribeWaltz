1
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>The public is of the view that we should</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of Iraq and be,</v>

2
00:00:11.281 --> 00:00:16.281
<v Speaker 1>we should be very careful about the use</v>
<v Speaker 1>of force or our resources are stressed,</v>

3
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>stretched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just have had a bad experience in</v>

4
00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:23.280
<v Speaker 1>though that always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that always tends to sour people and the</v>

5
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 1>use of force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the way Americans</v>

6
00:00:26.191 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>feel about the legitimacy of using</v>
<v Speaker 1>military force as a way of dealing with</v>

7
00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:34.140
<v Speaker 1>international problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's much stronger than it is in many</v>

8
00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 1>parts of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a,</v>

9
00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.400
<v Speaker 1>there's still more support in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States for preemptive war,</v>

10
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:46.401
<v Speaker 1>even given disillusionment with Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 1>than there is among our European allies.</v>

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.030
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that Americans are sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>down on war right now.</v>

13
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the public has a very Jacksonian</v>

14
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>of the use of military force generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>their los to do things but hurt us or</v>

18
00:01:07.831 --> 00:01:11.050
<v Speaker 1>threaten us and we'll go at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

19
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but the public is also very pragmatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>when things aren't working,</v>

20
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>they want out and they don't want to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>a American lives wasted.</v>

21
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not strictly,</v>

22
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:27.760
<v Speaker 1>but certainly the influence of public</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion on you can't conduct a war</v>

23
00:01:27.761 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>without public support in the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that was.</v>

24
00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>The message of Vietnam and the pressure</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get troops out of it,</v>

25
00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>get some sense that we're on our way</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

26
00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:38.360
<v Speaker 1>His very great and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it will be the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>factor,</v>

28
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 1>but it's one factor in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

29
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.160
<v Speaker 2>Iraq will play on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
