1
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we definitely will.</v>

2
00:00:08.691 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 1>I think they wouldn't be new collecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories that we don't even exist yet</v>

3
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>at this moment or that haven't come to</v>
<v Speaker 1>total fruition that are going to become</v>

4
00:00:17.151 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>more and more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

5
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 1>a old portable telephones or old</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these objects that we take for</v>

7
00:00:26.931 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>granted that we use in our daily lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we changed nearly every four to</v>

8
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.960
<v Speaker 1>those will become collecting categories</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their own right,</v>

10
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>or I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned earlier,</v>

11
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>Japanese toys and robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will become more and more valuable.</v>

12
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:47.681
<v Speaker 1>There will be a limited editions by</v>
<v Speaker 1>those artists who are great artists in</v>

13
00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>their own right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so these are markets that are going</v>

14
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>to develop and go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

15
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 2>it's this constantly evolving.</v>
