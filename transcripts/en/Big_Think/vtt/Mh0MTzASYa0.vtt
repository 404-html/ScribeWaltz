1
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Joseph stalin ran the Savi with as as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well known and iron grip.</v>

2
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't just his ruthlessness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>that was remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the way in which he's structured</v>

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>governance so that it was almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for any to Soviet citizens to</v>

5
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:34.660
<v Speaker 1>have a private relationship that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

6
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense,</v>

7
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>known to and subject to stolen.</v>

8
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So he was the node through which all</v>
<v Speaker 1>other nodes had to go to communicate.</v>

9
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>And Stalin who was famously paranoid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was suspicious about any interaction</v>

10
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.120
<v Speaker 1>between the Soviet citizens and</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially between the Soviet citizen</v>

11
00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and a foreigner that he didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

12
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting feature of hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't get understood,</v>

13
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>I think nearly well enough is that if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a hierarchical ruler,</v>

14
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>you are right to be paranoid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just the paranoid people</v>

15
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>tend to become a dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more that if you're a dictator,</v>

16
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>you need to be paranoid because the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat to a hierarchy is a success for</v>

17
00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:22.450
<v Speaker 1>the organized social network.</v>

18
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>A social network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>independence of the hierarchy of the big</v>

19
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>guy is the real threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once saw that,</v>

20
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:33.430
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Poland,</v>

21
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>why did Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all the communist regimes get into</v>

22
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:40.390
<v Speaker 1>trouble first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there was a really well</v>

23
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 1>organized civil society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all voluntary association,</v>

24
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>some religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some north that formed a network even</v>

25
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.410
<v Speaker 1>before the solidarity trade union came</v>
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

26
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's lethal to a hierarchical system,</v>

27
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.710
<v Speaker 1>which is why Stalin was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to put it this way,</v>

28
00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.050
<v Speaker 1>to be paranoid about social networking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he didn't control or didn't know</v>

29
00:02:05.051 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he understood that it doesn't take too</v>

30
00:02:09.251 --> 00:02:14.251
<v Speaker 1>many additional edges in the network to</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the dominance of that central</v>

31
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>node.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So one way of thinking about this is</v>

32
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 1>imagine a paramedic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old structure.</v>

33
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>Imagine something kind of like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas tree and there was the big guy</v>

34
00:02:24.851 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>like the ferry on top of the Christmas</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

35
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 1>But imagine that on this Christmas tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lights are just connected to the</v>

36
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>ferry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not connected to one another.</v>

37
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the theory decides if the</v>

38
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>lights go on or off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

39
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a peculiar kind of Christmas tree</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's essentially a hierarchical</v>

40
00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:46.450
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't take too many connections as</v>

41
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>it were lateral or horizontal</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections between the lights to reduce</v>

42
00:02:50.231 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>the centrality of the ferry on the tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.890
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately you could end up</v>
<v Speaker 1>illuminating the tree without needing,</v>

44
00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ferry altogether.</v>

45
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's why dictators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high rocks need to be paranoid.</v>

46
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Read the plays of Shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The suspicion that always seems to haunt</v>

47
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>any of Shakespeare's kings is that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>is some kind of plot,</v>

48
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>some cabal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some conspiracy going on.</v>

49
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you read the history of European</v>

50
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>monarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very often those suspicions were well</v>

51
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>founded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we call social networks look like</v>

52
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.950
<v Speaker 1>conspiracies to absolute rulers.</v>

53
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's why very often in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term seems to overlap what looks</v>

54
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>like a social network to you and me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're in,</v>

55
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a plot to the king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see the advantages of a</v>

56
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:48.100
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical system of government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a trip to China and,</v>

57
00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a system which is</v>

58
00:03:51.041 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high rock calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping is top man.</v>

59
00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>This system is good at doing engineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>

60
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.690
<v Speaker 1>If this system decides on building high</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed rail networks around China,</v>

61
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>it can do it with astonishing speed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the system decides that it's going</v>

62
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:12.184
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>build cities in the expectation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there will be a population to inhabit</v>

64
00:04:17.801 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can do that.</v>

65
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.230
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the most impressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspects of the last 30 years of human</v>

66
00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.420
<v Speaker 1>history has been the spectacular growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Chinese economy.</v>

67
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200
<v Speaker 1>And that has been in large measure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results of a highly effective</v>

68
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.310
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical system of planning.</v>

69
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would be naive if you went to</v>

70
00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>China's then didn't see some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with doing that.</v>

71
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems of pollution that have been</v>

72
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>a characteristic feature of modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese life.</v>

73
00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.690
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of the problem of</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

74
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.060
<v Speaker 1>This is an everyday topic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation in China.</v>

75
00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>At one party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical system of government isn't</v>

76
00:04:58.211 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's above the law.</v>

77
00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 1>And officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.030
<v Speaker 1>have routinely skimmed off a huge sums</v>
<v Speaker 1>of money to line their own pockets.</v>

79
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.500
<v Speaker 1>None of this comes as any news to people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who read hi,</v>

80
00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>a great book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The road to serfdom since the mid 20th</v>

81
00:05:15.851 --> 00:05:20.851
<v Speaker 1>century classical liberal scholars have</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that the planned economy is bound</v>

82
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>to be inefficient and it's bound to lead</v>
<v Speaker 1>to corruption and other abuses of power.</v>

83
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I think most people who think that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I include myself in that group,</v>

84
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:36.151
<v Speaker 1>were taken by surprise by the success of</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's economic growth strategy.</v>

85
00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Can this system endure through this 21st</v>
<v Speaker 1>century?</v>

86
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 1>That is a huge question for China's</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders and indeed for the world.</v>

87
00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.700
<v Speaker 1>If you are like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>skeptical about that of political</v>

88
00:05:59.061 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 1>centralization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll kind of sitting waiting for</v>

89
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 1>something to go wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because the defects of hierarchical</v>

90
00:06:07.251 --> 00:06:11.630
<v Speaker 1>system of government tends to be that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not responsive to,</v>

91
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 1>to signals from down below that top</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

92
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>Governance tends to be somewhat def.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

93
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.800
<v Speaker 1>not only does it not necessarily get</v>
<v Speaker 1>market signals,</v>

94
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:26.801
<v Speaker 1>it may miss out on political dissidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political discontent or to put it</v>

95
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>differently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've created through rapid</v>

96
00:06:30.021 --> 00:06:32.810
<v Speaker 1>industrialization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest middle class in all of</v>

97
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest bourgeoisie in history.</v>

98
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>And if Karl Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here sitting next to me,</v>

99
00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he'd agree that that was very</v>

100
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 1>hard to reconcile with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The system devised a bimalleolar Dong to</v>

101
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 1>centralize power in the hands of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single party marks would expect the</v>

102
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.940
<v Speaker 1>Borzois z in China to do what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>European bourgeoisie did in the 19th</v>

103
00:06:55.941 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Demand property rights,</v>

104
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>and therefore the rule of law to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>property rights and therefore some</v>

105
00:07:01.431 --> 00:07:03.170
<v Speaker 1>elements of representation in</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

106
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>So even from a Marxist perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something has to change.</v>

107
00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So hierarchical systems of government</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time tend at some point to suffer a</v>

108
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.870
<v Speaker 1>loss of legitimacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a challenge from below.</v>

109
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>And we've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw it in the history of the Soviet</v>

110
00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've seen it else were much less</v>

111
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:28.751
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated hierarchical systems like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military regimes of Latin America or</v>

112
00:07:29.691 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 1>the presidential regimes of the Middle</v>
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>

113
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to grief in some cases well before</v>

114
00:07:35.391 --> 00:07:36.440
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union did.</v>

115
00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
