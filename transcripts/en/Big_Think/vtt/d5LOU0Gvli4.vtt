00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I think that the United States should</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the power it has at its disposal to</v>

2
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.040
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect itself and protect its</v>

3
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then to the extent that we can try</v>

4
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>to create a more stable and more orderly</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

5
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 1>The problem is there's not very much we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do on that front in what separates</v>

6
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>me from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>many other people who work in the field</v>
<v Speaker 1>of American foreign policy is I think</v>

8
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:42.871
<v Speaker 1>there are real limits to our capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shape other societies that is not our</v>

9
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:48.241
<v Speaker 1>business or within our capacity to</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictate how other societies are going to</v>

10
00:00:49.241 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's their job and we're.</v>

11
00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>If we try to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to screw it up far more</v>

12
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:55.630
<v Speaker 1>often than we're going to succeed.</v>
