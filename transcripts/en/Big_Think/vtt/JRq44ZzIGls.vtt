1
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship with</v>

2
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 2>he hit a low in 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole cast of characters apart from</v>

3
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Bush himself has now changed or</v>
<v Speaker 2>different leaders in Britain,</v>

4
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 2>France and Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Italian moments come back again.</v>

5
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think,</v>

6
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the will in Europe is to make the</v>

8
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:41.751
<v Speaker 2>transatlantic relationship work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also I think the Putin now Medvedev</v>

9
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:47.961
<v Speaker 2>factor is making your opinions here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember why it's always quite useful to</v>

10
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:53.901
<v Speaker 2>have the merit to be with the Americans</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not feel scared or frightened were</v>

11
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 2>in the cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is preparing all these issues,</v>

12
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 2>a reason to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Atlantic countries are working</v>

13
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

14
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 2>it's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a partisan point that</v>

15
00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Europeans have been absolutely riveted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

16
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 2>by the election campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

17
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.410
<v Speaker 2>and it's free for all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

18
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 2>probably rooting for Obama just because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he represented something so different</v>

19
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from Bush that they can see the pr</v>

20
00:01:29.731 --> 00:01:33.990
<v Speaker 2>advantages at home and we just not say</v>
<v Speaker 2>there will be unhappy with Hillary.</v>

21
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I think they would be fine with hillary</v>
<v Speaker 2>to shoot because they got on okay with</v>

22
00:01:39.591 --> 00:01:42.180
<v Speaker 2>built towards the end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think people forget just how bad</v>

23
00:01:42.181 --> 00:01:44.850
<v Speaker 2>transatlantic relations were in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>first term of,</v>

24
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.840
<v Speaker 2>of Clinton over Bosnia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was actually very difficult time</v>

25
00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:50.640
<v Speaker 2>of need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the end he was fine.</v>

26
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.650
<v Speaker 2>A Boma represent a different sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

27
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so I think he would have an unusual</v>

28
00:01:58.831 --> 00:02:01.080
<v Speaker 2>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mccain would also,</v>

29
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.680
<v Speaker 2>we'll also have an opportunity to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's recognized to be a</v>

30
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 2>different emotion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it'd be a concern that he</v>

32
00:02:08.701 --> 00:02:13.701
<v Speaker 2>was carrying on the sort of a blustery</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of foreign policy.</v>

33
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Whereas I think Europeans would like</v>
<v Speaker 2>more diplomacy,</v>

34
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:24.921
<v Speaker 2>heavy American foreign policy rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>than one that just relies on sort of</v>

35
00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 2>threats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actual use of force.</v>

36
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 2>So a transplant integrations aren't</v>
<v Speaker 2>really that bad,</v>

37
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people are waiting as indeed</v>

38
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 2>Americans are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think 2009 will will be</v>

39
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 2>potentially quite a quite an interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>year in terms of whether you can see new</v>

40
00:02:50.371 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 2>directions in western foreign policy in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>
