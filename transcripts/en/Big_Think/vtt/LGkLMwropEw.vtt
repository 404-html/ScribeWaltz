1
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>My favorite job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>my purpose in life always has been to</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid work.</v>

3
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>And I hear these people saying I work</v>
<v Speaker 1>hard and I pay my taxes,</v>

4
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.490
<v Speaker 1>but you're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.360
<v Speaker 1>because in my readings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

6
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>if the Bible is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not a biblical scholar by any</v>

7
00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever,</v>

8
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it was,</v>

9
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>but they did something that apparently</v>
<v Speaker 1>and annoyed the guy that made them and</v>

10
00:00:44.921 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>they got booted and she was sentenced to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear children in pain in labor,</v>

11
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>which I didn't mention that we'll have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to grow up to be teenagers.</v>

12
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>And he was sentenced to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>work in the fields where the skin would</v>
<v Speaker 1>be pardoned by the sun and he's hands</v>

14
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:08.281
<v Speaker 1>will be torn by the thorns and thistles</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the field and we should earn his pred</v>

15
00:01:08.531 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>by the sweat of his brow.</v>

16
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.250
<v Speaker 1>So that to me is work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see.</v>

17
00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>So I always have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't do it.</v>

18
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:17.260
<v Speaker 1>He did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that him paid the price.</v>

19
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>All my sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's called original sin.</v>

20
00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 1>All mine are mine and all my sins are</v>
<v Speaker 1>original.</v>

21
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.180
<v Speaker 1>So I've avoided work all my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see?</v>

22
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I'd like it be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I call from flower to flower.</v>

24
00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 1>I go where the nectar is and then we</v>
<v Speaker 1>make life jus that a lot of money.</v>

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.370
<v Speaker 1>So whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm broadcasting,</v>

26
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.630
<v Speaker 1>I like it when I'm writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm broadcasting.</v>

27
00:01:49.631 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't wait to hear what I have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I'm writing.</v>

28
00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.810
<v Speaker 1>I thoroughly enjoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just goes off.</v>

29
00:01:55.811 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I write in Longhand and just goes on and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and on.</v>

30
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.160
<v Speaker 1>When I was in the saloon business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just would greet people and talk to</v>

31
00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>them and avoid taxes and getting behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bar.</v>

32
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>

33
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>I ran for governor of New York and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:02:10.841 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>I thoroughly enjoy campaigning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.440
<v Speaker 1>at all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mostly anything to do with the</v>

36
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>socializing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertaining,</v>

37
00:02:19.991 --> 00:02:22.690
<v Speaker 1>having a chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing like it.</v>

38
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>And I'm curious to know what's over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side there</v>

39
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 1>because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>people don't deal with thing is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't die here.</v>

41
00:02:37.211 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in America,</v>

42
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.630
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pass away,</v>

43
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.860
<v Speaker 1>they pass on the leavers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone no longer with us.</v>

44
00:02:44.861 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>Third piece there with the Lord,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the six feet hundred,</v>

45
00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 1>they've kicked the bucket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

46
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

47
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 1>and the other thing is they don't allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dying on the,</v>

48
00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever says that they don't evil on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the highway.</v>

49
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>They won't allow you to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am said,</v>

50
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 1>no passing to give you a ticket if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>die and die.</v>

51
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Speaker 1>I would say I'm more spiritual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

52
00:03:15.801 --> 00:03:20.801
<v Speaker 1>the way I look upon organized religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organized religion,</v>

53
00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a victim of that too.</v>

54
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.130
<v Speaker 1>mythology and of cruelty and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absurd stuff.</v>

57
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.410
<v Speaker 1>An organized religion has all the facets</v>
<v Speaker 1>of organized crime except the compassion</v>

58
00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.190
<v Speaker 1>of organized crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will only break your legs.</v>

59
00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.610
<v Speaker 1>What does organized religion we'll send</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to hell forever.</v>

60
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 1>We have to think about all that stuff of</v>
<v Speaker 1>snakes and paradise and even,</v>

61
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making the connection between why.</v>

62
00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guy,</v>

64
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:05.521
<v Speaker 1>whoever was made these Adam and eve and</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes all of these animals,</v>

65
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.980
<v Speaker 1>all the cows and sheep and pigs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>elephants and rhinoceros and rabbits and</v>

66
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:17.731
<v Speaker 1>the hare is and moles and octopuses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>salmon and trout</v>

67
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and snakes</v>

68
00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.410
<v Speaker 1>and of all the animals that he or she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever creative who brings one into</v>

69
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.010
<v Speaker 1>paradise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The snake.</v>

70
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.800
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd think you'd bring a a nice though</v>

71
00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:42.580
<v Speaker 1>to dog or her poodle or something at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise to keep Adam and Eve,</v>

72
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that company know a bloody snake and</v>

73
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>instead of a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we just take the cab would have</v>

74
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:54.931
<v Speaker 1>been no snake and not alone that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a talking snake who said,</v>

75
00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:56.500
<v Speaker 1>how are you eat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fine,</v>

76
00:04:56.501 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How bout this apple?</v>

77
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're all,</v>

78
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 1>let me try it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

79
00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Hey Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is great apple.</v>

80
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.910
<v Speaker 1>So she hands him the apple and they get</v>
<v Speaker 1>tossed out and he has to go on work.</v>

81
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>She has to bear children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the snake,</v>

82
00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 1>they say he has to crawl on his belly</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all eternity and eat dust.</v>

83
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 1>Now if he was a serpent before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did he get wrong?</v>

84
00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So the banished him and tossed him out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>center to Ireland and then the,</v>

85
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>say Saint Patrick came and vanished all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snakes from Ireland.</v>

86
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.380
<v Speaker 1>So he might have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think they all came here and</v>

87
00:05:38.381 --> 00:05:40.090
<v Speaker 1>took over the Saint Patrick's Day</v>
<v Speaker 1>parade.</v>

88
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.193
<v Speaker 1>That's my ideal.</v>

89
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

90
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am an alcoholic,</v>

91
00:05:49.091 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

92
00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 1>and it is a harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we caught a disease,</v>

93
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>an explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not an excuse.</v>

94
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So once I know I'm an alcoholic than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>is by a fountain obligation [inaudible]</v>

95
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 1>to see what I can do about healing</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

96
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no recovery from alcoholism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an incurable disease.</v>

97
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>And it also is a disease which tells you</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a disease.</v>

98
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>It tells you I am your friends and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need at any given time is that it'll</v>

99
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>drinky pool to make life good and all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

100
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.290
<v Speaker 1>So then you'd take the little drinky</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool and the next thing you know,</v>

101
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>you're consumed about 40 drinky pose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're acting like a complete ass or</v>

102
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.920
<v Speaker 1>that you were before you had the drink</v>
<v Speaker 1>depaul.</v>

103
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I discovered that and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never,</v>

105
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I would never become an alcoholic like</v>
<v Speaker 1>my father because my father deserted us,</v>

106
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 1>but diseases that don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no let up.</v>

107
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>They get you somewhere or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the alcoholism got me and I ruined my</v>

108
00:07:11.301 --> 00:07:16.010
<v Speaker 1>first marriage with drinking and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lying,</v>

109
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 1>the seat infidelity and all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole bloody thing there was,</v>

110
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>I was the complete one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alienated my first wife.</v>

111
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And although I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was not abusive in the physical sense</v>

112
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.020
<v Speaker 1>in that I did never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

113
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.150
<v Speaker 1>never a hillsborough hit or like manny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

114
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

115
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:42.961
<v Speaker 1>I'm not addicted to that kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I also alienated my children from</v>

116
00:07:43.371 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 1>that marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on good terms with them now.</v>

117
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
