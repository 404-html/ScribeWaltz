00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>People sometimes ask what does it all</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very hard question to</v>
<v Speaker 1>address because it's not clear what an</v>

3
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>answer would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A question that I found much more</v>

4
00:00:11.401 --> 00:00:16.401
<v Speaker 1>fruitful that I think one can address</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensitively is does the world and body</v>

5
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:21.651
<v Speaker 1>beautiful ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a question we can address on both</v>

6
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>sides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the world and what is beauty?</v>

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>What is the world of course is the kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of question that science addresses.</v>

8
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>What is beauty is something that art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and a human culture</v>

9
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 1>addresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we can look at the record of what</v>

10
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 1>people have found beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were hoping for in their</v>

11
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with what the remarkable understanding</v>

12
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>of the world we've achieved in recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>years looks like.</v>

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>And we can therefore a frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful discussion and a meaningful</v>

14
00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a meaningful meditation on the issue of</v>

15
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>does the world embodied beautiful ideas.</v>

16
00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>Some of the things that people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of this adventure we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping for and uh,</v>

18
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>had in their visions was in [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the world embodies</v>

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>harmonies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he talked about a music of the</v>

20
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>spheres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plato,</v>

21
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a theory of Adam's based on the so</v>

22
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>called Platonic solids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are very symmetric objects.</v>

23
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>They were hoping that our sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony,</v>

24
00:01:39.871 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>so somehow agreed with what nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>likes to use and her construction of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

26
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.210
<v Speaker 1>And more specifically with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:55.211
<v Speaker 1>with Plato and the platonic solids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that ideas that symmetry and</v>

28
00:01:55.891 --> 00:01:58.410
<v Speaker 1>mathematical perfection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

29
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>provide the building principals that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world embodies</v>

30
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.130
<v Speaker 1>those themes which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>Pythagoras and Plato articulated very</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in the early days,</v>

32
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have inspired people for centuries,</v>

33
00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior to the modern times when we found</v>

34
00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>that nature does in fact use those</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

35
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Visual imagery is very important to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of the world because</v>

36
00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>humans are intensely visual creatures.</v>

37
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you do the accounting</v>

38
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>between 20 and 50% of our brain is</v>
<v Speaker 1>devoted to processing visual information</v>

39
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>and we have some very impressive</v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities in that direction we face</v>

40
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 1>in interpreting the world a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging problem that we're good at</v>

41
00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:58.530
<v Speaker 1>solving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so good at it.</v>

42
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>With that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't consciously realize how</v>

43
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>difficult it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem of taking the</v>

44
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>electromagnetic radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light that impinges on our retina,</v>

45
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>giving a two dimensional image that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>all scrambled and interpreting that as a</v>

46
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>three worlds of three dimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects moving around in three</v>

47
00:03:21.071 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>dimensional space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very difficult,</v>

48
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible mathematical problem.</v>

49
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.050
<v Speaker 1>But we have many sophisticated tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 1>and rules of thumb plus a systematic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>although unconscious knowledge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>projective geometry so that we can</v>

52
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>recognize that the same thing seen from</v>
<v Speaker 1>different positions is,</v>

53
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.160
<v Speaker 1>is this represents the same object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were,</v>

54
00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were made conscious as a</v>

55
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.670
<v Speaker 1>geometric theorems and discoveries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>astonishing achievements that,</v>

56
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Brunelleschi discovered the science</v>

57
00:04:04.031 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>of perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in 1420 help kicked off kickoff the</v>

58
00:04:08.261 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>glorious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>episode of the Italian Renaissance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

60
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a foundation of art ever since.</v>
