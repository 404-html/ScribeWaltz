1
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.660
<v Speaker 1>That's a very interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that one can say as a</v>

2
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>blanket statement that America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm an American.</v>

3
00:00:15.451 --> 00:00:17.740
<v Speaker 1>I think there are parallels in both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are parallels in too much trust in</v>

5
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:26.550
<v Speaker 1>government and I think you saw that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>some degree in the 19 sixties with</v>

6
00:00:26.551 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>America's legacy in entry intervention</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Vietnam and even to I think to a</v>

7
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:32.880
<v Speaker 1>slightly lesser degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you saw that with the wake of Iraq after</v>

8
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:36.390
<v Speaker 1>a period after nine slash 11 when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans were more trusting of their</v>

9
00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 1>leaders and wanting to believe and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>follow their leaders.</v>

10
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>so they're excessive trust can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>dangerous,</v>

12
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:48.381
<v Speaker 1>particularly when it leads to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress and the judiciary and the press</v>

13
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.790
<v Speaker 1>being complacent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their acceptance of the official</v>

15
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.490
<v Speaker 1>version of events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

16
00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too radical a distrust,</v>

17
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can prevent government from being able</v>

18
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:08.121
<v Speaker 1>to function a effectively that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that public leaders publicly,</v>

19
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>you want public leaders to earn people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust by being honest with them,</v>

20
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>by being effective in what they do.</v>

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>Because unless the government is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>government is able to earn some degree</v>

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>of public trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not able to bring Americans along</v>

23
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>the hard decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was very important in Franklin</v>

24
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt taking American to World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two that he was able to bring to develop</v>

25
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>the trust of the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>obviously Pearl Harbor made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a,</v>

27
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>made a big difference in our entrance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world of throughput that the</v>

28
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Franklin Roosevelt was very shrewd about</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the degree that he had to</v>

29
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>build trust in the American amongst the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American people,</v>

30
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>and a mix even amongst people of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposing party,</v>

31
00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>which is why he systematically brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans and political opponents in</v>

32
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>to work with him on foreign policy in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order that he could maintain the trust</v>

33
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>to bring Americans to do something which</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very difficult.</v>

34
00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Which to send our troops again into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>European war.</v>
