1
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Every technology I look at is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>entering this expedites will go.</v>

2
00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Ray Kurzweil says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is any technology.</v>

3
00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:07.870
<v Speaker 1>It becomes</v>

4
00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 2>the information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It starts advancing exponentially.</v>

5
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.380
<v Speaker 2>It seems that everything is being</v>
<v Speaker 2>digitized now and every technology I</v>

6
00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 2>look at seems to be entering this</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponential curve and what happens is</v>

7
00:00:18.281 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 2>that when technology is advancing at an</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponential curves,</v>

8
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 2>they're doing amazing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when technologies converge,</v>

9
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 2>when exponential technologies converge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's when you get industry</v>

10
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 2>disruptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Behind everything is computing.</v>

11
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.830
<v Speaker 2>You know this device over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my estimate is more powerful than 40</v>

12
00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 2>cray super computers were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember cray super computers that we</v>

13
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>used to cost in the tens of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars that had export controls on</v>

14
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is more powerful than those cray</v>

15
00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 2>super computers where there's something</v>
<v Speaker 2>in computing called Moore's law,</v>

16
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 2>but Moore's law stipulates that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>processing power of computers doubles</v>

17
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:55.780
<v Speaker 2>every year or two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the number of transistors,</v>

18
00:00:55.781 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 2>but what in fact happens is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>power increases,</v>

19
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.740
<v Speaker 2>the cost drops and this size become</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller.</v>

20
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.090
<v Speaker 2>This exponential curve they're computing</v>
<v Speaker 2>is on means that faster computers can</v>

21
00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 2>design faster computers with faster</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers.</v>

22
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 2>You can now design new types of sensors</v>
<v Speaker 2>with faster computers.</v>

23
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.560
<v Speaker 2>You can now build artificial</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence with faster computers.</v>

24
00:01:17.561 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 2>You can now analyze data like wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>even never analyze before.</v>

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 2>When you have artificial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sensors and robotics coming</v>

26
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:26.930
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get R,</v>

27
00:01:26.931 --> 00:01:27.230
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>d,</v>

28
00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Two from from star wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get these humanoid robots that can</v>

29
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 2>do what human beings can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the ability now to have robots</v>

30
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 2>that can stock your shelves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can operate machinery,</v>

31
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.850
<v Speaker 2>that can be receptionists in your</v>
<v Speaker 2>offices,</v>

32
00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.820
<v Speaker 2>so you have multiple technologies coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>

33
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which make it possible to do things I</v>

34
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 2>could never be done before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at drones,</v>

35
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>what are drones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had flying machines for a long time,</v>

36
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 2>but these flying machines we used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build these toys.</v>

37
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 2>We built this toy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Helicopters weren't stable when you</v>

38
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>added a dreamer shifts to them when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>added computing to them and you added</v>

39
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 2>deliberative artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence to them so they</v>

40
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:07.630
<v Speaker 2>could keep track of all the data around</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

41
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 2>You had the ability to have these drones</v>
<v Speaker 2>being stable and now ship goods,</v>

42
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 2>so drones are advancing almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponentially and those drones are gonna</v>

43
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 2>disrupt the entire logistics industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine now being able to have your mail</v>

44
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 2>being delivered to your mailbox using</v>
<v Speaker 2>drone.</v>

45
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Imagine having packages being delivered</v>
<v Speaker 2>by drone.</v>

46
00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 2>Imagine having us being delivered by</v>
<v Speaker 2>drone.</v>

47
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at a hung and what they're doing in</v>

48
00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:37.840
<v Speaker 2>Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really a drone on steroids that's</v>

49
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 2>being used to transport human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every industry I look at,</v>

50
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.210
<v Speaker 2>I see as being ready for major</v>
<v Speaker 2>disruption.</v>

51
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:48.790
<v Speaker 2>Manufacturing is going to come back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

52
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.350
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is coming back to the United States</v>

53
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:53.350
<v Speaker 2>right now because of robots that can do</v>
<v Speaker 2>what human beings can do.</v>

54
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 2>You have financial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about way disrupted because you</v>

55
00:02:56.411 --> 00:02:58.720
<v Speaker 2>have robot advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have digital,</v>

56
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>you now have data which kind of stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>trades and so on.</v>

57
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.990
<v Speaker 2>All of these advances happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm about to just help finance and</v>

58
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>when you look at transportation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have electric cars which are</v>

59
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 2>becoming cheaper and cheaper because of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advances in battery technologies.</v>

60
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 2>You have self driving technologies</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the advances in ai imagined</v>

61
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.060
<v Speaker 2>self driving electric cars that cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 15 or $20,000 in the year,</v>

62
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:22.894
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25.</v>

63
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>What do you think has been happening to</v>
<v Speaker 2>GM,</v>

64
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 2>Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toyota,</v>

65
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 2>all of these companies will still need</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or two electric companies,</v>

66
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:32.440
<v Speaker 2>but more likely than not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be some upstarts from silicon</v>

67
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:36.920
<v Speaker 2>valley or from New Delhi or from Sao</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paulo that put the right technologies</v>

68
00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:39.690
<v Speaker 2>together and that are inexpensive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that started disrupting the entire</v>

69
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 2>transportation industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon we're going to have virtual</v>

70
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 2>reality that's going to disrupt</v>
<v Speaker 2>education itself.</v>

71
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being able to put glasses on and</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch me watch this in three dimensions</v>

72
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.160
<v Speaker 2>and converse with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine me able to meet with people</v>

73
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>interactively on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on are on Mars or in Tahiti.</v>

74
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.820
<v Speaker 2>That's going to disrupt the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

75
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.080
<v Speaker 2>conferencing industry because we will be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to have meetings in exotic places</v>

76
00:04:04.151 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 2>and it'll feel like we're almost there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

77
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 2>Education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being able to learn science by,</v>

78
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by doing virtual experiments,</v>

79
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.750
<v Speaker 2>anatomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by seeing your human body inside and</v>

80
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine learning mathematics by going</v>

81
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 2>into ancient Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And building permits,</v>

82
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.820
<v Speaker 2>imagine learning Latin by going back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and,</v>

83
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 2>and talking to people in Latin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is all becoming possible and</v>

84
00:04:31.121 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 2>this is within five years we'll have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

85
00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Imagine having digital tutors that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that monitor your expressions.</v>

86
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Cameras can already do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then monitor the child's interest in</v>

87
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>learning.</v>

88
00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.820
<v Speaker 2>If the child likes to play games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it plays games with them.</v>

89
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 2>The child likes to play to watch videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes them into three dimensional</v>

90
00:04:49.931 --> 00:04:52.150
<v Speaker 2>holographic worlds and lets them</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

91
00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have experiences and learn on their</v>

92
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>own is the child likes reading books.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reads books to them.</v>

93
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about disrupting</v>
<v Speaker 2>education itself.</v>

94
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 2>Now granted that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.450
<v Speaker 2>the harvards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Carnegie Mellon's,</v>

96
00:05:05.451 --> 00:05:06.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the elite universities have several</v>

97
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 2>brand name was still value them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the world's masters will be able to</v>

98
00:05:10.571 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 2>now get into holographic words and learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many new ways.</v>

99
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Every single industry where technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>can be applied is about to be disrupted</v>

100
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:21.541
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>

101
00:05:21.541 --> 00:05:22.374
<v Speaker 2>in a big way.</v>

102
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at our own health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's happening now is that we become</v>

103
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 2>data and no doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got mixed software.</v>

104
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 2>Let me explain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were fitbit's,</v>

105
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 2>we were all these devices that monitor</v>
<v Speaker 2>body's functioning,</v>

106
00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 2>move forward five years and will have</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensors in our clothing.</v>

107
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that fruit of the loom tag in</v>
<v Speaker 2>your underwear,</v>

108
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>which is monitoring you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 slash seven,</v>

109
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 2>monitoring your activity levels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is monitoring your ekg is all</v>

110
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.080
<v Speaker 2>these different symptoms that can be</v>
<v Speaker 2>captured from the skin.</v>

111
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Imagine it being gathered 24 slash seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>being uploaded to the cloud and having</v>

112
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>an ai now analyzing the data and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

113
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.330
<v Speaker 2>you're about to get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to get some exercise,</v>

114
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 2>and then having all of these cameras and</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensors which watch what we're eating,</v>

115
00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.570
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>

116
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 2>alright Vivec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't need that extra piece of Pie.</v>

117
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abort,</v>

118
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:15.794
<v Speaker 2>abort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>abort.</v>

119
00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.820
<v Speaker 2>This is all becoming possible in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next five years or so,</v>

120
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 2>we should be able to build these</v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies.</v>

121
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.810
<v Speaker 2>So we have digital doctors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

122
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 2>the second part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>genomics,</v>

123
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 2>in the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a race between the US</v>

124
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 2>government and a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>greg venter,</v>

125
00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.970
<v Speaker 2>to sequence the human genome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government and affiliated lab spent</v>

126
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 2>two point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$5,000,000,000.</v>

127
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.520
<v Speaker 2>Venter came up with $100,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't ask cow,</v>

128
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 2>but he took government data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any sequence,</v>

129
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:44.120
<v Speaker 2>a human genome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It made front page news worldwide.</v>

130
00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 2>For a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>

131
00:06:46.371 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 2>We thought genomics was a waste of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>

132
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>but over the last two or three years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's now gone at this exponential curve.</v>

133
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>The study's been published very</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently.</v>

134
00:06:56.241 --> 00:06:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost every week you're seeing</v>

135
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>groundbreaking study is about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>discoveries,</v>

136
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 2>discoveries in genomics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the correlations between our health and</v>

137
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 2>our genes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know something.</v>

138
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.440
<v Speaker 2>What blows my mind the most is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome.</v>

139
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 2>When you went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your teacher,</v>

140
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 2>your biology teacher taught you that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've made up of cells and the cells</v>

141
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:21.410
<v Speaker 2>have a nucleus and that's where your DNA</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

142
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.230
<v Speaker 2>Do you know something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What she taught you was wrong?</v>

143
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 2>We made up of bacteria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have somewhere between two and 10</v>

144
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 2>times more bacteria in our body than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have cells.</v>

145
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 2>The same technology which is sequenced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to sequence the human body and</v>

146
00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.270
<v Speaker 2>that's being used to sequence plants has</v>
<v Speaker 2>been sequenced.</v>

147
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 2>It's been used to sequence the bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our gut and for the last few years</v>

148
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.780
<v Speaker 2>they had been measured breakthrough than</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

149
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Now I have a google alert on the word</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome.</v>

150
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.780
<v Speaker 2>Everyday I read new studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new breakthroughs happening with the</v>

151
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>microbiome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems that the DNA is important and</v>

152
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 2>relevant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we may be looking under the wrong.</v>

153
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.000
<v Speaker 2>A lamp over here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also study which is showing that</v>

154
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.000
<v Speaker 2>it's what we eat and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

155
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these trillions of bacteria that we have</v>

156
00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 2>in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our body that there may be regulating</v>

157
00:08:12.081 --> 00:08:12.720
<v Speaker 2>our health unit.</v>

158
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.810
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will study.</v>

159
00:08:14.811 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 2>There was a study published in nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine about a year and a half ago in</v>

160
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:19.760
<v Speaker 2>we say took the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

161
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:22.550
<v Speaker 2>the feces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I can say this on big thing.</v>

162
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:27.551
<v Speaker 2>Feces means shit to feces of a fat mouse</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gave it to 'em a 10 miles.</v>

163
00:08:28.871 --> 00:08:32.000
<v Speaker 2>And the thin mouths gained weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took the feces from a thin Muslin,</v>

164
00:08:32.001 --> 00:08:34.640
<v Speaker 2>gave it to a fat mouse and the mouse</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost weight.</v>

165
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.910
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is also replicated some of these</v>

166
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 2>findings in human beings and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>determined that there's a correlation</v>

167
00:08:41.931 --> 00:08:46.370
<v Speaker 2>between obesity and your microbiome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so forget all these diets we've been</v>

168
00:08:46.371 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 2>obsessed with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it simply be a matter of taking</v>

169
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.210
<v Speaker 2>the feces of a thin person and giving it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a fat person and a fat person loses</v>

170
00:08:53.211 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 2>weight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's watch this space over the next</v>

171
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 2>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have scientific evidence of this</v>

172
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 2>and also curing disease.</v>

173
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.900
<v Speaker 2>They've been studies to show the Crohn's</v>
<v Speaker 2>disease,</v>

174
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 2>which is a debilitating disease that</v>
<v Speaker 2>children get.</v>

175
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 2>They took the feces of a healthy child</v>
<v Speaker 2>and gave it to an unhealthy child and it</v>

176
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:14.280
<v Speaker 2>appears that the unhealthy child was</v>
<v Speaker 2>killed.</v>

177
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.810
<v Speaker 2>You're curing disease by transplanting</v>
<v Speaker 2>bacteria.</v>

178
00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:20.820
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

179
00:09:20.821 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics.</v>

180
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 2>There have been several studies which</v>
<v Speaker 2>show that children who received</v>

181
00:09:25.921 --> 00:09:30.921
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics than to be a base,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may well be that antibiotics are</v>

182
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 2>killing off entire species of bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our body and they're making us sick.</v>

183
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the crazy prediction.</v>

184
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:38.874
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

185
00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 2>but I really believe this is going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>happen that within 10 or 15 years we</v>

186
00:09:44.821 --> 00:09:47.310
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to the conclusion that antibiotics</v>

187
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 2>were destroying our health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may well be that we look at</v>

188
00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:54.900
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics the same way we look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>those leeches that they use to suck out</v>

189
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:57.080
<v Speaker 2>blood from patients in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

190
00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:57.641
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

191
00:09:57.641 --> 00:09:58.474
<v Speaker 2>in England.</v>

192
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.880
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the belief was that you could kill</v>

193
00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 2>health by sucking our blood using</v>
<v Speaker 2>leeches.</v>

194
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:06.390
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be what antibiotics are doing</v>

195
00:10:06.391 --> 00:10:10.170
<v Speaker 2>to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still emerging technology.</v>

196
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 2>We don't know yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when I read these studies every day,</v>

197
00:10:13.950 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>that is a conclusion I'm getting to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire Western medical system is</v>

198
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 2>about to be up ended through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>microbiome.</v>

199
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.320
<v Speaker 2>So move forward to the 20 20th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have all of these diagnostic data.</v>

200
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:29.850
<v Speaker 2>We have all of these data about our</v>
<v Speaker 2>genome and our microbiome.</v>

201
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:35.160
<v Speaker 2>We have data on not thousands of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hundreds of millions of people.</v>

202
00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.820
<v Speaker 2>And we have ai that analyzes all of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

203
00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 2>That app on your smartphone that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>monitoring you.</v>

204
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Twenty four slash seven may be the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>doctor you've ever had.</v>

205
00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.980
<v Speaker 2>It's your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's your advisor,</v>

206
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:52.260
<v Speaker 2>it guides you on how to maintain optimal</v>
<v Speaker 2>health and it guides you on how to get</v>

207
00:10:52.261 --> 00:10:53.640
<v Speaker 2>healed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do get sick,</v>

208
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.790
<v Speaker 2>this is five slash 10 maximum 15 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now,</v>

209
00:10:56.791 --> 00:11:00.750
<v Speaker 2>I think closer to the five to 10 year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a beard that will have all these amazing</v>

210
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:02.880
<v Speaker 2>advances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is exponential.</v>

211
00:11:02.881 --> 00:11:04.380
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

212
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.780
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

213
00:11:05.850 --> 00:11:07.560
<v Speaker 2>what the future holds in health.</v>

214
00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.210
<v Speaker 2>If you look at artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know when I was young I was reading</v>

215
00:11:16.211 --> 00:11:21.211
<v Speaker 2>about how ai would soon be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>defeat the humans at playing chess and</v>

216
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 2>everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will,</v>

217
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.340
<v Speaker 2>all these predictions made in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties about how ai will become smarter</v>

218
00:11:27.341 --> 00:11:30.380
<v Speaker 2>than men.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in the 1980 then in 1990</v>

219
00:11:30.381 --> 00:11:32.890
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we heard about Japan and the fifth</v>

220
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:36.100
<v Speaker 2>generation project,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sort of thought that Japan would rule</v>

221
00:11:36.101 --> 00:11:39.100
<v Speaker 2>the world and an ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then what happened?</v>

222
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Nothing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We basically had what was called the</v>

223
00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:45.130
<v Speaker 2>new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ai winter that,</v>

224
00:11:45.131 --> 00:11:45.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

225
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.910
<v Speaker 2>there was a cloud cost over Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was a hoax.</v>

226
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>It was a fraudulent and ai was dead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't dead,</v>

227
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>is everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because here's,</v>

228
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.430
<v Speaker 2>here's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists also started speculating on a</v>

229
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.090
<v Speaker 2>new method of doing ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Ai that defeated Garry Kasparov,</v>

230
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.790
<v Speaker 2>big blue was really a decision tree.</v>

231
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.090
<v Speaker 2>It did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if then l statements of every possible</v>

232
00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 2>chess move and with super fast</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers,</v>

233
00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:16.420
<v Speaker 2>it was able to outsmart a human being</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really simplifying the</v>

234
00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:19.300
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's more or less the ai we had a</v>

235
00:12:19.301 --> 00:12:24.301
<v Speaker 2>decade or 15 years ago and scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>have speculated that maybe we could do a</v>

236
00:12:24.791 --> 00:12:27.550
<v Speaker 2>different form of Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could mimic the human brain.</v>

237
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.020
<v Speaker 2>The human brain has layers of neurons</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you know,</v>

238
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.380
<v Speaker 2>and the connections between the neurons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the program based on what's learned.</v>

239
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>So a child sees a dog and mom says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the doggy,</v>

240
00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.870
<v Speaker 2>this is a cat and this and the neurons</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjust themselves to do associate that,</v>

241
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.850
<v Speaker 2>that image of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

242
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 2>an animal with the ears and a tail and</v>
<v Speaker 2>so on,</v>

243
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:53.860
<v Speaker 2>the shape with a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So outbrain programs itself based on</v>

244
00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:56.860
<v Speaker 2>what it learns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So scientists speculated there were</v>

245
00:12:56.861 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 2>papers published study years about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we could do ai using neural</v>

246
00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:01.234
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>

247
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.230
<v Speaker 2>Here's what the problem was to do neural</v>
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>

248
00:13:04.231 --> 00:13:08.650
<v Speaker 2>We needed massively parallel computers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't have those,</v>

249
00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.870
<v Speaker 2>even the fastest supercomputers of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>time in the 1970,</v>

250
00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 2>then the 19 eighties and even 19</v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties,</v>

251
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.340
<v Speaker 2>couldn't do massively parallel computing</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a decade ago and video and decided</v>

252
00:13:21.971 --> 00:13:26.260
<v Speaker 2>to develop a chip to let children play</v>
<v Speaker 2>video games better.</v>

253
00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.970
<v Speaker 2>The GPU,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the graphics processing unit and,</v>

254
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.870
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they released it a few years ago.</v>

255
00:13:31.871 --> 00:13:35.950
<v Speaker 2>It became a big success and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists are looking at that Gpu and</v>

256
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 2>realize that that's a massively parallel</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer.</v>

257
00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Why can't we now do ai with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Started doing it and machine learning,</v>

258
00:13:44.741 --> 00:13:48.610
<v Speaker 2>develop their many words over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but essentially we started mimicking the</v>

259
00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:50.560
<v Speaker 2>human brain and using these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

260
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.910
<v Speaker 2>these GPS to learn the way human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

261
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.000
<v Speaker 2>That's when you started having Elon Musk</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Stephen Hawking and a bunch of</v>

262
00:13:58.001 --> 00:14:00.670
<v Speaker 2>others talking about artificial general</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence saying,</v>

263
00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are going to be smarter</v>

264
00:14:02.021 --> 00:14:04.030
<v Speaker 2>than us and all of these dangers.</v>

265
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:08.050
<v Speaker 2>The trouble was that that was the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>of science fiction and this was narrow</v>

266
00:14:08.051 --> 00:14:10.960
<v Speaker 2>ai where you specifically taught a</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer what to learn.</v>

267
00:14:10.961 --> 00:14:14.290
<v Speaker 2>You developed a model and then you throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>data at it and it learned from that.</v>

268
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 2>So we assumed that you this age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was 20,</v>

269
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:21.850
<v Speaker 2>30 years away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's what happened in the last couple</v>

270
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:26.850
<v Speaker 2>of weeks with a narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>narrow ai that a bunch of scientists</v>

271
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 2>figured out how to defeat capture by</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the computer learn itself,</v>

272
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>did experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really tried every combination,</v>

273
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.010
<v Speaker 2>figured it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Google was able to um,</v>

274
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:43.530
<v Speaker 2>to have alphago which is defeat these</v>
<v Speaker 2>goplayers at learned on its own.</v>

275
00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:48.130
<v Speaker 2>So it seems like narrow ai is running on</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own now.</v>

276
00:14:48.131 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 2>You can throw anything you want at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you take that one step further and</v>

277
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:52.470
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

278
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:56.390
<v Speaker 2>I can learn anything that you wants to</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn and you'll begin to see out of</v>

279
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.310
<v Speaker 2>your general artificial general</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

280
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 2>the stuff out of science fiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming possible.</v>

281
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.810
<v Speaker 2>So this is all happening a lot faster</v>
<v Speaker 2>than if anyone.</v>

282
00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Anyone imagined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

283
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 2>maybe there was some people who saw it</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming,</v>

284
00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:13.160
<v Speaker 2>but the vast majority of experts in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>field didn't think that ai would</v>

285
00:15:13.161 --> 00:15:17.210
<v Speaker 2>progress at the rate it's progress just</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the last few weeks and it could</v>

286
00:15:17.211 --> 00:15:22.160
<v Speaker 2>well be that we get are today to a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You Remember Star Wars Rosie from the</v>

287
00:15:22.161 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 2>jetsons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Samantha from her.</v>

288
00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.710
<v Speaker 2>All of these things was found science</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction that they starts showing up in</v>

289
00:15:27.711 --> 00:15:32.450
<v Speaker 2>our apps and then in these bots we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>at home in the next seven to 10 years.</v>

290
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:38.230
<v Speaker 2>So I won't be surprised if I'm able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>order a rosy on Amazon.com in the year</v>

291
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25,</v>

292
00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>27 and she's droned over to my house and</v>

293
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:48.491
<v Speaker 2>Rosie costs about $10,000 because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how ai and robotics and whole bunch</v>

294
00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 2>of other technologies are advancing</v>
<v Speaker 2>exponentially.</v>

295
00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Ever since the Internet came out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've started ordering things on the</v>

296
00:16:00.041 --> 00:16:02.250
<v Speaker 2>Internet with the first one is some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

297
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:04.990
<v Speaker 2>some of the earliest websites were</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

298
00:16:04.991 --> 00:16:07.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these websites is retailing websites</v>

299
00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:10.720
<v Speaker 2>where you could buy oddities on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet.</v>

300
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:14.050
<v Speaker 2>And then we could buy clothing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet and then you can buy shoes on</v>

301
00:16:14.051 --> 00:16:16.570
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now Amazon has become a dominant</v>

302
00:16:16.571 --> 00:16:20.260
<v Speaker 2>player because practically everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need can be ordered on the Internet</v>

303
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:22.960
<v Speaker 2>and it comes to your house often within</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour or so.</v>

304
00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 2>So that was retail disruption</v>
<v Speaker 2>one-on-one.</v>

305
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.320
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something even more dramatic is</v>

306
00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:33.280
<v Speaker 2>happening that the retail store itself</v>
<v Speaker 2>is becoming digitized.</v>

307
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:37.240
<v Speaker 2>When you walk into your supermarket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you walk into any retail store,</v>

308
00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.160
<v Speaker 2>you'll note that the camera's over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

309
00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.420
<v Speaker 2>you know the last two years or so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability for computers to recognize</v>

310
00:16:46.421 --> 00:16:49.440
<v Speaker 2>faces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exceeded the ability of human beings to</v>

311
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.680
<v Speaker 2>do recognize faces.</v>

312
00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:54.940
<v Speaker 2>So those cameras now had the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know who you are.</v>

313
00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.960
<v Speaker 2>And they have the ability now to just do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a interface with the registers where you</v>

314
00:17:01.181 --> 00:17:03.760
<v Speaker 2>buy things and to keep track of what are</v>
<v Speaker 2>you but your bought.</v>

315
00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Give it five or 10 years and you'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>walking up to the counters and you'll</v>

316
00:17:08.561 --> 00:17:11.230
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll have ads being served to you</v>

317
00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.110
<v Speaker 2>based on your buying habits and based on</v>
<v Speaker 2>your interests.</v>

318
00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:18.310
<v Speaker 2>So the entire retail experience begins</v>
<v Speaker 2>to change because you have customized</v>

319
00:17:18.311 --> 00:17:21.250
<v Speaker 2>coupons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>customized ads all being served 50</v>

320
00:17:21.251 --> 00:17:22.120
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk in there,</v>

321
00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:26.230
<v Speaker 2>but then also the sensors I talked about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cameras,</v>

322
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.230
<v Speaker 2>they can also detect inventory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can see what's on the shelf,</v>

323
00:17:29.231 --> 00:17:33.010
<v Speaker 2>how much of it has been sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't until today we we've had human</v>

324
00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:36.580
<v Speaker 2>beings going and doing an inventory</v>
<v Speaker 2>checks every two or three days ago and</v>

325
00:17:36.581 --> 00:17:38.830
<v Speaker 2>see what needs to be stacked and so on.</v>

326
00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:43.210
<v Speaker 2>But with this cameras they can keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>track of what's on the shelves and they</v>

327
00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:47.620
<v Speaker 2>can automatically order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New replenishment is as needed and then</v>

328
00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:51.240
<v Speaker 2>we'll have robots that can go and</v>
<v Speaker 2>replenish the shelves rather than human</v>

329
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:53.200
<v Speaker 2>beings going in and stalking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

330
00:17:53.201 --> 00:17:56.160
<v Speaker 2>I'll sell boxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you had robots that can do that</v>

331
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.500
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number of robotic technologies that</v>

332
00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:00.630
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can go in and do this thing,</v>

333
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:04.470
<v Speaker 2>but give it five or seven years we'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>have robots replenishing shelves,</v>

334
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:09.800
<v Speaker 2>will have sensors and ai monitoring</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventory move forward a couple of</v>

335
00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:11.790
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtual reality is going to become much</v>

336
00:18:11.791 --> 00:18:15.230
<v Speaker 2>more powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine wearing eyeglasses that dundalk</v>

337
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 2>and take you into a holographic worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine now being able to meet people</v>

338
00:18:19.921 --> 00:18:23.070
<v Speaker 2>where they want to and being able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>converse with them as if you were there.</v>

339
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.050
<v Speaker 2>Imagine not being able to go into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>store and now pick and choose what you</v>

340
00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Speaker 2>want from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being able to examine the merchandise</v>

341
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:31.281
<v Speaker 2>and just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

342
00:18:31.281 --> 00:18:34.380
<v Speaker 2>I'll take it and imagine having a drone</v>
<v Speaker 2>over to your house.</v>

343
00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Let me switch gears now and talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>saving the world because I live in</v>

344
00:18:44.201 --> 00:18:48.970
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley and frankly I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>depressed at the fact that the tens of</v>

345
00:18:48.971 --> 00:18:51.790
<v Speaker 2>billions of dollars being thrown at</v>
<v Speaker 2>mindless apps,</v>

346
00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:55.000
<v Speaker 2>they would happen to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some kid comes up with some new</v>

347
00:18:55.090 --> 00:19:00.070
<v Speaker 2>stupid APP and he gets $100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million in funding and other vcs give to</v>

348
00:19:00.071 --> 00:19:03.710
<v Speaker 2>another hundred million dollars a</v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive it is.</v>

349
00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:09.220
<v Speaker 2>We basically chasing rainbows in silicon</v>
<v Speaker 2>valley and not understanding the</v>

350
00:19:09.221 --> 00:19:12.310
<v Speaker 2>problems of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in India.</v>

351
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.700
<v Speaker 2>I traveled the world and when I go</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

352
00:19:15.701 --> 00:19:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I see poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see despair.</v>

353
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:19.260
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

354
00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people living in ill health.</v>

355
00:19:20.951 --> 00:19:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I see hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see disease,</v>

356
00:19:23.411 --> 00:19:25.930
<v Speaker 2>I see you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a majority.</v>

357
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>I see people getting sick because of bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>water and it's depressing to see that we</v>

358
00:19:31.101 --> 00:19:33.970
<v Speaker 2>are living in silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're blessed living in New York City.</v>

359
00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:35.710
<v Speaker 2>You're blessed because you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you need.</v>

360
00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:38.110
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know we see poverty and we ignore it,</v>

361
00:19:38.111 --> 00:19:40.780
<v Speaker 2>but by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not sensitive to the needs of the</v>

362
00:19:40.781 --> 00:19:43.270
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You travel to the developing world.</v>

363
00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:45.910
<v Speaker 2>You see the dire poverty and the pain</v>
<v Speaker 2>and suffering,</v>

364
00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.200
<v Speaker 2>but you know something I believed in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next 10 or 15 years we can solve</v>

365
00:19:50.201 --> 00:19:52.510
<v Speaker 2>virtually all of these problems that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

366
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.800
<v Speaker 2>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

367
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.930
<v Speaker 2>hurting people so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

368
00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.460
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest volume is energy.</v>

369
00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:01.660
<v Speaker 2>When people in remote parts of India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

370
00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.850
<v Speaker 2>South America come home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't study because they don't have</v>

371
00:20:06.851 --> 00:20:09.590
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something we can't comprehend in</v>

372
00:20:09.591 --> 00:20:11.380
<v Speaker 2>America that you don't have lights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can study.</v>

373
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.500
<v Speaker 2>Therefore children don't get education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is a common problem in the</v>

374
00:20:14.501 --> 00:20:17.080
<v Speaker 2>developing world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 eight percent of the infections</v>

375
00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:20.080
<v Speaker 2>disease in the developing world is</v>
<v Speaker 2>caused by water borne viruses.</v>

376
00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:21.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you went to school,</v>

377
00:20:21.881 --> 00:20:24.280
<v Speaker 2>you learned how to distilled water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do,</v>

378
00:20:24.281 --> 00:20:26.980
<v Speaker 2>your body did you capture the</v>
<v Speaker 2>condensation and that is the distilled</v>

379
00:20:26.981 --> 00:20:27.640
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

380
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.570
<v Speaker 2>Distilled water is 100 percent pure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing living in it right now.</v>

381
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:35.530
<v Speaker 2>All it takes to have 100 percent clean</v>
<v Speaker 2>water to boil the oceans and have all</v>

382
00:20:35.531 --> 00:20:39.190
<v Speaker 2>the water we need is energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trouble is it energy has been so</v>

383
00:20:39.191 --> 00:20:40.720
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

384
00:20:40.721 --> 00:20:42.520
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's changing.</v>

385
00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We're headed into an era of unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean and almost free energy.</v>

386
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Here's what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solar Wind,</v>

387
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.280
<v Speaker 2>take solar as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cost of solar has dropped 99 percent</v>

388
00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 2>since 1976.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what happens is that as the price</v>

389
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:03.520
<v Speaker 2>drops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the installations installations double</v>

390
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 2>as the is double the price drops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're in a virtuous cycle of here of,</v>

391
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.210
<v Speaker 2>of exponential technology advances at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pace we're going.</v>

392
00:21:13.211 --> 00:21:17.440
<v Speaker 2>We're only about six doublings away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the capability of generating 100</v>

393
00:21:17.441 --> 00:21:20.140
<v Speaker 2>percent of the earth's energy needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>through solar.</v>

394
00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.530
<v Speaker 2>This sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the dumplings are happening less</v>

395
00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:24.460
<v Speaker 2>than every two years from now.</v>

396
00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.340
<v Speaker 2>So what I'm saying is that by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 or so,</v>

397
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.480
<v Speaker 2>we could have unlimited clean energy on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this planet from sunlight and the cost</v>

398
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.040
<v Speaker 2>will be a fraction of what it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine one 16th of what it is today,</v>

399
00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.390
<v Speaker 2>one 30th of what it is today in less</v>
<v Speaker 2>than 15 years from now.</v>

400
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:46.000
<v Speaker 2>This seems crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems unimaginable,</v>

401
00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 2>but all you have to do is look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>data and look at the trend.</v>

402
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 2>It is as clear as can be now in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we regressing because you now have the</v>

403
00:21:53.681 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 2>US government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I say US government,</v>

404
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:58.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean Donald Trump talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing coal back.</v>

405
00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.260
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about stopping the progress</v>
<v Speaker 2>of solar energy because it disrupts us</v>

406
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.030
<v Speaker 2>unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is complete nonsense.</v>

407
00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Mean solar is generating more jobs than</v>
<v Speaker 2>coal ever had.</v>

408
00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.550
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good for America.</v>

409
00:22:12.551 --> 00:22:13.240
<v Speaker 2>It's good for the world.</v>

410
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.600
<v Speaker 2>But regardless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>leave America site America is not</v>

411
00:22:16.601 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 2>relevant anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The really good news that we hear is</v>

412
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.460
<v Speaker 2>that America isn't leading the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

413
00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:22.960
<v Speaker 2>It's China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number one.</v>

414
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They have committed to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think 200 gigawatts in the next five</v>

415
00:22:27.281 --> 00:22:29.170
<v Speaker 2>or seven years in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>

416
00:22:29.171 --> 00:22:31.120
<v Speaker 2>they talk about 100 gigawatts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about,</v>

417
00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two largest population countries in</v>

418
00:22:34.391 --> 00:22:38.560
<v Speaker 2>the world now leading the bath on solar</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even America decides to bring coal</v>

419
00:22:38.561 --> 00:22:41.310
<v Speaker 2>back instead of coal fire plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter the world.</v>

420
00:22:41.311 --> 00:22:42.550
<v Speaker 2>World War simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>laugh at us.</v>

421
00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:46.960
<v Speaker 2>The cost of solar will still still</v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced and the beauty of this is that</v>

422
00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Speaker 2>every village in the world will now have</v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

423
00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:50.661
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

424
00:22:50.661 --> 00:22:51.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

425
00:22:51.410 --> 00:22:54.760
<v Speaker 2>the challenge over here is that you need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to store the energy because it doesn't.</v>

426
00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 2>The Sun doesn't shine and when it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>sunny,</v>

427
00:22:57.070 --> 00:22:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the wind doesn't blow and it's windy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>

428
00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:02.170
<v Speaker 2>the good thing is that the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 2>storage is also dropping exponentially.</v>

429
00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:05.830
<v Speaker 2>We should talk about three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four or $500 a kilowatt hour for</v>

430
00:23:05.831 --> 00:23:09.130
<v Speaker 2>storage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elon musk is hinting at $100 a kilowatt</v>

431
00:23:09.131 --> 00:23:13.630
<v Speaker 2>hour the next three or four years and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>could go to $70 a kilowatt hour.</v>

432
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.690
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about prices such as that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about self driving</v>

433
00:23:16.691 --> 00:23:19.990
<v Speaker 2>electric cars called costing about 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$20,000.</v>

434
00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Being able to drive 200 miles by the mid</v>
<v Speaker 2>20,</v>

435
00:23:22.961 --> 00:23:24.280
<v Speaker 2>20 is 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>25.</v>

436
00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:27.910
<v Speaker 2>We could have cars that cost $1,500 and</v>
<v Speaker 2>go 100,</v>

437
00:23:27.911 --> 00:23:31.630
<v Speaker 2>200 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about now having enough</v>

438
00:23:31.631 --> 00:23:34.570
<v Speaker 2>storage for village for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand dollars,</v>

439
00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.540
<v Speaker 2>which means that you could have entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>villages,</v>

440
00:23:37.550 --> 00:23:42.550
<v Speaker 2>entire towns all over the world which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are off the grid and have unlimited</v>

441
00:23:43.091 --> 00:23:46.550
<v Speaker 2>clean energy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we can have unlimited clean water</v>

442
00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.230
<v Speaker 2>because we could just boil the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can now have lights that children can</v>

443
00:23:51.231 --> 00:23:55.430
<v Speaker 2>come home and study and we can educate</v>
<v Speaker 2>them because they'll also have</v>

444
00:23:55.431 --> 00:23:58.430
<v Speaker 2>smartphones that provided them with</v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

445
00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:04.150
<v Speaker 2>We can now have diagnostic devices which</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide them with information so that</v>

446
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.190
<v Speaker 2>they can get into the smartphone and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

447
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.430
<v Speaker 2>They can grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have vertical farms.</v>

448
00:24:10.431 --> 00:24:14.270
<v Speaker 2>This is another amazing technology that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't talk very much about in the</v>

449
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:16.610
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but vertical farming is now advancing</v>

450
00:24:16.611 --> 00:24:20.210
<v Speaker 2>exponentially because of two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>different convergences.</v>

451
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.860
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>led lighting.</v>

452
00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to understand that led</v>
<v Speaker 2>lighting now has become cost about the</v>

453
00:24:26.571 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 2>same as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as these old bugs we had the edison</v>

454
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:33.230
<v Speaker 2>bulbs in the developing world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even cheaper and led lighting the,</v>

455
00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.170
<v Speaker 2>there was a Nobel prize two years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>for led lighting.</v>

456
00:24:36.410 --> 00:24:40.340
<v Speaker 2>They've been such amazing breakthroughs</v>
<v Speaker 2>in led lighting so that you can now</v>

457
00:24:40.890 --> 00:24:42.030
<v Speaker 2>fueling the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

458
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:47.100
<v Speaker 2>the frequencies to the growth of plants</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can now have inexpensive energy</v>

459
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.490
<v Speaker 2>led lights and now you can also have</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensors and sensors,</v>

460
00:24:52.491 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 2>cameras and other devices which monitor</v>
<v Speaker 2>crop growth,</v>

461
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.890
<v Speaker 2>which monitor the growth of every plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give them exactly the right nutrients,</v>

462
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:04.370
<v Speaker 2>glass houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about organic food.</v>

463
00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:09.710
<v Speaker 2>We will be able to grow almost unlimited</v>
<v Speaker 2>food because of these advances in energy</v>

464
00:25:09.711 --> 00:25:12.440
<v Speaker 2>led lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ai and sensors.</v>

465
00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That's in the next five or 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we could literally have a planet</v>

466
00:25:18.081 --> 00:25:23.081
<v Speaker 2>that's abundant in energy and food that</v>
<v Speaker 2>has perfect health in which we can three</v>

467
00:25:24.261 --> 00:25:28.640
<v Speaker 2>d print our clothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these things are within reach</v>

468
00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.530
<v Speaker 2>now that make get to the dark side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this.</v>

469
00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:39.640
<v Speaker 2>And I talked about the advances in ai</v>
<v Speaker 2>and robotics and sensors,</v>

470
00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:44.820
<v Speaker 2>industry disruptions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite what the optimists say,</v>

471
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.460
<v Speaker 2>despite what Silicon Valley says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a scenario in which we'll</v>

472
00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:53.500
<v Speaker 2>have enough jobs for human beings that</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

473
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:56.380
<v Speaker 2>it will be new jobs graded zoomed by.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don says,</v>

474
00:25:56.381 --> 00:25:58.630
<v Speaker 2>and God knows what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid example.</v>

475
00:25:58.631 --> 00:26:02.290
<v Speaker 2>Is that a tech mogul to throw up about</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new jobs that'll be created?</v>

476
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:06.070
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that these uber drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these taxi drivers in New York City,</v>

477
00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.890
<v Speaker 2>the even the uber drivers that we have</v>
<v Speaker 2>here now,</v>

478
00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.330
<v Speaker 2>when the jobs get displaced,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they aren't going to be new jobs for</v>

479
00:26:13.331 --> 00:26:14.920
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truck drivers,</v>

480
00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about 3 million truck</v>
<v Speaker 2>drivers in the United States when we</v>

481
00:26:18.611 --> 00:26:21.430
<v Speaker 2>have self driving trucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is very likely in the next five</v>

482
00:26:21.431 --> 00:26:25.510
<v Speaker 2>years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those Middle East truck drivers who</v>

483
00:26:25.511 --> 00:26:29.050
<v Speaker 2>don't have other skills and driving are</v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be able to learn how to</v>

484
00:26:29.051 --> 00:26:31.840
<v Speaker 2>program robots or how to do Zumba</v>
<v Speaker 2>dancing.</v>

485
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.490
<v Speaker 2>Those truck drivers will be unemployed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about people whose</v>

486
00:26:36.491 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 2>livelihood depends on jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whose social stature depends on jobs.</v>

487
00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.610
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 2>I think about it when we meet other</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost the first question we ask is what</v>

489
00:26:46.111 --> 00:26:50.100
<v Speaker 2>do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're defined by our jobs and we take</v>

490
00:26:50.101 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>pride in creativity and in our work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives revolve around our work.</v>

491
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:59.670
<v Speaker 2>What happens when work disappears?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you have all the energy you</v>

492
00:26:59.671 --> 00:27:00.960
<v Speaker 2>want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the food you want,</v>

493
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 2>you have perfect health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have all the things that you need.</v>

494
00:27:03.931 --> 00:27:07.020
<v Speaker 2>You're able to three d print your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your food and clothing and all that.</v>

495
00:27:07.021 --> 00:27:08.490
<v Speaker 2>If you have all of those things taken</v>
<v Speaker 2>care of,</v>

496
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 2>you have nothing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel depressed.</v>

497
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.430
<v Speaker 2>What's the new social structure over</v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

498
00:27:14.670 --> 00:27:17.730
<v Speaker 2>What did we do with ourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So silicon valley talks about universal</v>

499
00:27:17.731 --> 00:27:18.564
<v Speaker 2>basic income.</v>

500
00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 2>That's their excuse for saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else's problem.</v>

501
00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.650
<v Speaker 2>It will be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let us get filthy rich and let someone</v>

502
00:27:25.651 --> 00:27:27.930
<v Speaker 2>else worry about the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can just give money to everyone.</v>

503
00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 2>No people just don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many people want a purpose in life.</v>

504
00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.850
<v Speaker 2>They want to be contributing to society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to be doing good.</v>

505
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:40.880
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to be be earning their keep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't want free money next,</v>

506
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:42.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>

507
00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.930
<v Speaker 2>15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about him even as soon as five</v>

508
00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:48.390
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about millions of people,</v>

509
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:50.910
<v Speaker 2>10 tens and millions of big people</v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming unemployed,</v>

510
00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 2>becoming depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm really rebelling that,</v>

511
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to the luddite movement.</v>

512
00:27:57.301 --> 00:28:00.840
<v Speaker 2>So try to stop the progress of</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology because their livelihoods are</v>

513
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:03.930
<v Speaker 2>being taken away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worry about his dog scenario.</v>

514
00:28:03.931 --> 00:28:07.290
<v Speaker 2>I worry about them wanting to burn down</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

515
00:28:07.291 --> 00:28:10.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tech companies and to stop progress</v>

516
00:28:10.711 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 2>at all costs because their jobs are</v>
<v Speaker 2>being taken away.</v>

517
00:28:12.990 --> 00:28:15.030
<v Speaker 2>Strikes just like you've had strikes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paris,</v>

518
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.450
<v Speaker 2>you taxi drivers trying to burn down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber's,</v>

519
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:20.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm exaggerating a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it turned to stop Uber's.</v>

520
00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.750
<v Speaker 2>You may have that in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may have a people whose lives have</v>

521
00:28:24.751 --> 00:28:28.590
<v Speaker 2>been displaced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You met people who have lost their</v>

522
00:28:28.591 --> 00:28:31.650
<v Speaker 2>livelihood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is now getting angrier and protesting.</v>

523
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.490
<v Speaker 2>Look what's happening in DC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a government that's pandering to</v>

524
00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.130
<v Speaker 2>the extremist groups to the anger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

525
00:28:38.131 --> 00:28:41.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was unimaginable even two years ago</v>

526
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:46.340
<v Speaker 2>that we will be accusing the White House</v>
<v Speaker 2>of being Nazi sympathizers mean.</v>

527
00:28:46.771 --> 00:28:50.250
<v Speaker 2>This is craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the allegations are not founded,</v>

528
00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.000
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that we can even make those</v>
<v Speaker 2>allegations shows that something is</v>

529
00:28:54.001 --> 00:28:55.460
<v Speaker 2>wrong over here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

530
00:28:55.461 --> 00:28:56.490
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

531
00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:57.170
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

532
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:02.170
<v Speaker 2>the gap between the haves and the have</v>
<v Speaker 2>nots has grown not only in money which</v>

533
00:29:02.251 --> 00:29:05.280
<v Speaker 2>is always talk about before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also in knowledge,</v>

534
00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.890
<v Speaker 2>in culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in values.</v>

535
00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 2>We're technical people who are watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>this or technology literate that you get</v>

536
00:29:11.491 --> 00:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>your information online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you watch videos such as this and you</v>

537
00:29:14.551 --> 00:29:17.340
<v Speaker 2>stay up to date with this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The people in Middle America,</v>

538
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.500
<v Speaker 2>the truck drivers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the taxi drivers,</v>

539
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.430
<v Speaker 2>many of them don't watch this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not up to date.</v>

540
00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:28.670
<v Speaker 2>We're doing nothing to mitigate the gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are policymakers are talking about</v>

541
00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 2>taking things away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking healthcare away from people,</v>

542
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:36.190
<v Speaker 2>taking benefits away from people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not talking about how do we now</v>

543
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.770
<v Speaker 2>uplift all of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

544
00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 2>they think we have limited resources and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to ration them,</v>

545
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:46.030
<v Speaker 2>but they don't seem to realize that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>heard it edited to an era of abundance</v>

546
00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.900
<v Speaker 2>in which we can now distribute the</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective of grading and uplift all of</v>

547
00:29:49.901 --> 00:29:50.734
<v Speaker 2>mankind.</v>

548
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.300
<v Speaker 2>In my book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the driver and the driver of scar.</v>

549
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I tried to look at technology through</v>
<v Speaker 2>three lenses and the purpose of this was</v>

550
00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:10.780
<v Speaker 2>to figure out how we can create the</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing future star trek versus the</v>

551
00:30:10.810 --> 00:30:14.290
<v Speaker 2>darkness of Mad Max.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three lenses are,</v>

552
00:30:14.291 --> 00:30:17.050
<v Speaker 2>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does the technology have the potential</v>

553
00:30:17.051 --> 00:30:20.410
<v Speaker 2>to benefit everyone equally?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we make sure that everyone gets good</v>

554
00:30:20.411 --> 00:30:22.540
<v Speaker 2>healthcare from it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we make sure that everyone gets</v>

555
00:30:22.541 --> 00:30:25.060
<v Speaker 2>clean energy from it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we make sure that everyone benefits</v>

556
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:28.060
<v Speaker 2>from the technology so that we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have people being left out and we don't</v>

557
00:30:28.061 --> 00:30:31.780
<v Speaker 2>have anger brewing and then go back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>movies such as war of the worlds.</v>

558
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:36.280
<v Speaker 2>Go back to a lot of these science</v>
<v Speaker 2>fiction horror movies in these movies.</v>

559
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.970
<v Speaker 2>The rich had access to better technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they had health,</v>

560
00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.390
<v Speaker 2>they had all sorts of good things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull had nothing.</v>

561
00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.020
<v Speaker 2>They were working in the mines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The outcome was always the same in all</v>

562
00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:52.021
<v Speaker 2>of these movies that the war ended up</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing the rich madmax that the anger</v>

563
00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.290
<v Speaker 2>started brewing and rebellion started</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the focus was to destroy the</v>

564
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:00.220
<v Speaker 2>technology to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>

565
00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.780
<v Speaker 2>to kill the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

566
00:31:01.781 --> 00:31:03.820
<v Speaker 2>this is what happens in all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>dark movies.</v>

567
00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.420
<v Speaker 2>If we don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start educating and uplifting everyone</v>

568
00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.420
<v Speaker 2>within had mad max.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second lens is,</v>

569
00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.080
<v Speaker 2>do the rewards outweigh the risks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this technology going to benefit us</v>

570
00:31:14.081 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>or is it going to hurt us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to look at every technology to</v>

571
00:31:16.631 --> 00:31:18.970
<v Speaker 2>make sure that the rewards outweigh the</v>
<v Speaker 2>risks.</v>

572
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.010
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gene editing Crispr,</v>

573
00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.680
<v Speaker 2>we now have the ability to alter life</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

574
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:28.300
<v Speaker 2>In about a decade from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will have the ability to select the,</v>

575
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:29.134
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

576
00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:31.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feature that our children have.</v>

577
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:35.440
<v Speaker 2>This sounds crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we may be able to take pills that</v>

578
00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:40.470
<v Speaker 2>alter the genome of an embryo and give</v>
<v Speaker 2>them new characteristics due to remove</v>

579
00:31:41.861 --> 00:31:43.990
<v Speaker 2>disease and to give them maybe extra Iq.</v>

580
00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.500
<v Speaker 2>This is all becoming possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another question that if you do that,</v>

581
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.460
<v Speaker 2>do not create the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

582
00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the world of Gatica,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that movie Gattica in which you had,</v>

583
00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have enhanced and then you</v>

584
00:31:56.171 --> 00:31:58.700
<v Speaker 2>had people who want enhanced and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that were unanswered.</v>

585
00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.000
<v Speaker 2>It's basically based on society and</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what,</v>

586
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:05.230
<v Speaker 2>the people who want enhanced rebelled or</v>
<v Speaker 2>we now creating super human beings.</v>

587
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:09.490
<v Speaker 2>Are we not creating killer viruses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will now creating massive joblessness</v>

588
00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:12.120
<v Speaker 2>and we're now creating all of these new</v>
<v Speaker 2>nightmares with technologies.</v>

589
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Do the rewards truly outweigh the risks?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the question is,</v>

590
00:32:16.790 --> 00:32:19.330
<v Speaker 2>does the technology great autonomy or</v>
<v Speaker 2>dependence?</v>

591
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big fan of self driving cars.</v>

592
00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I drive a tesla model s and I can't wait</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get into auto drive when I get on the</v>

593
00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:29.020
<v Speaker 2>highway because I want the car to drive</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

594
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:32.050
<v Speaker 2>Now eventually when I say eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 10,</v>

595
00:32:32.051 --> 00:32:35.130
<v Speaker 2>15 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be deciding that we don't</v>

596
00:32:35.131 --> 00:32:39.950
<v Speaker 2>want these dangerous human beings on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>road is human beings get distracted.</v>

597
00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:41.990
<v Speaker 2>They text while they're driving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get angry,</v>

598
00:32:41.991 --> 00:32:43.930
<v Speaker 2>they get road rage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russian,</v>

599
00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.850
<v Speaker 2>the traffic at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they crash into each other.</v>

600
00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.820
<v Speaker 2>They're dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't want these dangerous animals on</v>

601
00:32:49.821 --> 00:32:51.050
<v Speaker 2>our roads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>

602
00:32:51.051 --> 00:32:55.880
<v Speaker 2>we want to have smart ai and robots</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing the driving,</v>

603
00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.160
<v Speaker 2>so we made it through the human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>off the road,</v>

604
00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:01.380
<v Speaker 2>which means that we've lost autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

605
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.310
<v Speaker 2>We get angry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gone are the tilt of driving,</v>

606
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:08.120
<v Speaker 2>so on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>self driving cars give us autonomy.</v>

607
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Why autonomy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because everyone now can get familiar</v>

608
00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:13.850
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to be where they want to be</v>

609
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>safely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mothers can send their children to</v>

610
00:33:16.821 --> 00:33:18.680
<v Speaker 2>school knowing that they will safely</v>
<v Speaker 2>arrived there,</v>

611
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.710
<v Speaker 2>the that blind to people who are</v>
<v Speaker 2>handicapped.</v>

612
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:25.610
<v Speaker 2>The old don't have to worry about having</v>
<v Speaker 2>to drive anymore.</v>

613
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.320
<v Speaker 2>We have autonomy like we've never had</v>
<v Speaker 2>before because it's not driving cars,</v>

614
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:34.760
<v Speaker 2>but then we lose another autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That autonomy is the right of being able</v>

615
00:33:34.761 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 2>to drive on highways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have a trade off over here.</v>

616
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:40.160
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it lead to.</v>

617
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Does technology to independence or</v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomy?</v>

618
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.950
<v Speaker 2>In the case of self driving cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's both dependents and autonomy at the</v>

619
00:33:45.951 --> 00:33:48.320
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we've got to figure this out.</v>

620
00:33:48.321 --> 00:33:50.600
<v Speaker 2>We've got to figure out what the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradeoffs are.</v>

621
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:55.220
<v Speaker 2>So what I posit in driver in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>driverless car is that we have to look</v>

622
00:33:55.221 --> 00:33:58.210
<v Speaker 2>at each technology technology through</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

623
00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.400
<v Speaker 2>These three lenses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what I believe,</v>

624
00:34:01.401 --> 00:34:04.250
<v Speaker 2>but I sincerely believe is that if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>get these right,</v>

625
00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.720
<v Speaker 2>that if we now benefit everyone and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>do things in a sensible way,</v>

626
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:13.880
<v Speaker 2>we can create the amazing future of Star</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trek that we really can get to this</v>

627
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:17.570
<v Speaker 2>world in which we're now sharing</v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity.</v>

628
00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:21.410
<v Speaker 2>We're seeking enlightenment and others</v>
<v Speaker 2>were working to uplift humanity.</v>

629
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.990
<v Speaker 2>And we can do this 300 years old</v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule.</v>
