00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2
00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I can probably say the most about</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare because that's an area where,</v>

3
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:13.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a devoted in approximately last five or</v>

5
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>six years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really intensively to kind of try to</v>

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.540
<v Speaker 1>understand the puzzle of how healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>and healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have every opportunity to</v>

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>truly</v>
<v Speaker 1>transform,</v>

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of patient in healthcare if we</v>

10
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>actually are able to go back and step</v>
<v Speaker 1>back from the incremental changes to</v>

11
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>what we have today and ask ourselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would it take for us to create a</v>

12
00:00:44.881 --> 00:00:47.370
<v Speaker 1>dramatically higher value system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

13
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've written a lot,</v>

14
00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>a lot about this lately and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

15
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and talk about it incessantly now,</v>

16
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

17
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.541
<v Speaker 1>things like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.380
<v Speaker 1>just how you organize care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like how you measure success.</v>

20
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things are very,</v>

21
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

22
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>our best guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that we could get double the value</v>

24
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>from the amount of money we're spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>today or we could get pretty much the</v>

25
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>same value for half the money were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>that's the order of magnitude of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation.</v>

27
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>And I'm very optimistic about healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I now see enough grassroots</v>

28
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:28.401
<v Speaker 1>bottom up effort and enough belief in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic framework of that,</v>

29
00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>that value is how we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we need to think and,</v>

30
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the patient's perspective is what we</v>

31
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>should care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I,</v>

32
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

33
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>I can see a line of sight to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a,</v>

34
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.410
<v Speaker 1>a healthcare system that will be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>proud of and it'll,</v>

35
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>it'll lead the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it'll be affordable.</v>
