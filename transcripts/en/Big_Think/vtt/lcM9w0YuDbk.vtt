1
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln suspended the writ of Habeas</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corpus a number of times during the</v>

2
00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at first in 1861,</v>

3
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:23.821
<v Speaker 1>he suspended it first along the railroad</v>
<v Speaker 1>line between New York,</v>

4
00:00:24.311 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Washington,</v>

5
00:00:26.651 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>because there were riots going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Penn,</v>

6
00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Maryland,</v>

7
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>people trying to block troops coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to protect Washington.</v>

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at first it wasn't a military district,</v>

9
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

10
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of a war,</v>

11
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:43.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and later the writ of Habeas Corpus of</v>

12
00:00:43.391 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 1>suspended for the whole country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certainly they were abuses of civil</v>

13
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 1>liberties on the Lincoln.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No question about it.</v>

14
00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:52.510
<v Speaker 1>People were arrested who just for giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches,</v>

15
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 1>criticizing the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were newspapers temporarily</v>

16
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:57.820
<v Speaker 1>suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we should not think that Lincoln was</v>

17
00:00:57.821 --> 00:00:59.350
<v Speaker 1>a dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tyrant.</v>

18
00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>There was great criticism all through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the war of him.</v>

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>And the elections went on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody said,</v>

20
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>let's suspend the elections because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

21
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:08.344
<v Speaker 1>the war is on.</v>

22
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly I think Lincoln</v>

23
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:16.381
<v Speaker 1>established a dangerous precedent that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution doesn't really apply in</v>

24
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>wartime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now,</v>

25
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>unlike our recent president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln directly address this question,</v>

26
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:25.270
<v Speaker 1>he went to Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

27
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I may have stepped over the line here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's my problem.</v>

28
00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's my situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was faced with this thing.</v>

29
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>Do I abide by the law and let the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>country fall apart or do I violate this</v>

30
00:01:36.611 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>one law and therefore save the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>

31
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a difficult question to answer.</v>

32
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there is no simple answer,</v>

33
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but at least Lincoln put it on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>

34
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a serious problem.</v>

35
00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.160
<v Speaker 1>President Bushes never even admitted</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as any kind of problem.</v>

36
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.730
<v Speaker 1>He just blindly goes his own way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acting if there is as if there is no</v>

37
00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>now the other thing is in the civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States face the greatest</v>

39
00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>crisis in its history and the greatest</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat to its,</v>

40
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>its existence as a nation.</v>

41
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attack of nine 11 was a tragic</v>

42
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:11.920
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't threaten the existence of</v>

43
00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:15.310
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is no thought that al Qaeda</v>

44
00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:18.340
<v Speaker 1>today is actually going to overthrow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government of the United States.</v>

45
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.960
<v Speaker 1>They can commit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:21.110
<v Speaker 1>heinous acts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

47
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to take over the</v>

48
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>government donald to Osama bin Ladin</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be president anytime soon.</v>

49
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.410
<v Speaker 1>So we don't face the kind of threat to</v>
<v Speaker 1>our national existence that Lincoln</v>

50
00:02:31.601 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 1>faced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history shows that almost any government</v>

52
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 1>conducting a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll find the constitution and</v>

53
00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>inconvenience and we'll try to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>around it.</v>

54
00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>And this has happened during World War</v>
<v Speaker 1>One with the suppression of freedom of</v>

55
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.510
<v Speaker 1>speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened in World War Two with the</v>

56
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:52.120
<v Speaker 1>internment of Japanese Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

57
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the lesson?</v>

58
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It's simply that we have to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>vigilant about our liberties and that</v>

59
00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.123
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>to realize you can conduct a war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>still respect civil liberties.</v>

61
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln is saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a democratic view,</v>

62
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>if people think I have abused my power</v>
<v Speaker 1>or have not conducted the war properly</v>

63
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>or intelligent leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll vote me out of power.</v>

64
00:03:15.821 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>That's what democracy is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you a chance to boot the guys</v>

65
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>and Lincoln ran for president reelection</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1864,</v>

67
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>and even though he won a very large</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority,</v>

68
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>we should not forget that in August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not long before the election,</v>

69
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln and most politicians thought he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to lose that the war was at a</v>

70
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>stalemate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a great deal of discontent.</v>

71
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln and the Republican Party thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was going to lose.</v>

72
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were people who came to and said,</v>

73
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>you've got to rescind the emancipation</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclamation.</v>

74
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>People think that it is prolonging the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war,</v>

75
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>that if you tell the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back and you can keep slavery,</v>

76
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>they'll come back now.</v>

77
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>But if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back and you've got to get rid of</v>

78
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:58.360
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is just making them fight longer.</v>

79
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.940
<v Speaker 1>So rescind the emancipation</v>
<v Speaker 1>proclamation.</v>

80
00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot do that.</v>

81
00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I would be damned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and time and eternity or something like</v>

82
00:04:06.071 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

83
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't willing to do quote unquote</v>

84
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:11.104
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

85
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>anything that might be done to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>reelected.</v>

86
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.550
<v Speaker 1>The problem with Lincoln's quote though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in the midst of a war,</v>

87
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>it often is quite popular to trample on</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties.</v>

88
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the things that President Bush</v>

89
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>has done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if had popular support,</v>

90
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>rounding up people with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Muslim names,</v>

91
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chucking them into jail with no charge,</v>

92
00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:33.970
<v Speaker 1>throwing away the key holding people at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guantanamo.</v>

93
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>when people are frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are willing to support serious</v>

95
00:04:41.891 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>infringements on other people's civil</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties.</v>

96
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Civil liberties are not supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject to popular vote.</v>

97
00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>They are in the constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the protection of minorities.</v>

98
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:59.170
<v Speaker 1>The person who holds popular views,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his freedom of speech is never in</v>

99
00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the person who's the dissenter,</v>

100
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:05.440
<v Speaker 1>who has unpopular views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you don't put that up to a popular</v>

101
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>vote to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>should this guy be able to give a speech</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing the war?</v>

103
00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.381
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

104
00:05:11.381 --> 00:05:12.730
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

105
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln's view of democracy in a certain</v>

106
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>sense is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>

107
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really reflect the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties are the protection of</v>

108
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.550
<v Speaker 1>minorities against majorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore they can't be just</v>

109
00:05:24.551 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>subjected to majority vote.</v>
