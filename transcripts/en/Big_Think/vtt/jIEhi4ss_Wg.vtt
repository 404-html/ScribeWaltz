1
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Terms of what we need for this planet to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a future,</v>

2
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and solve these big issues before it's</v>

3
00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need two things.</v>

4
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>We need this new methodology of some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind that I mentioned earlier,</v>

5
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bringing up a new methodology of</v>

6
00:00:25.451 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>global problem solving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>

7
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>whether it's the global issues network</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that I mentioned or some other idea</v>

8
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>that is for the heads of states to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver or the prime ministers of this</v>

9
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>world to deliver on a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and individuals in that area can be</v>

10
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>active as voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as lobbyists,</v>

11
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>as civil society and help push towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>that direction.</v>

12
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.680
<v Speaker 1>But the main way in which individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>can help is with regard to the second</v>

13
00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to have a future on this planet.</v>

14
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 1>And that has to do not with</v>
<v Speaker 1>methodological changes,</v>

15
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:03.790
<v Speaker 1>but with mindset changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The type of individual we need from</v>

16
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>is an individual who feels that he or</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is first global citizen.</v>

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a national citizen.</v>

19
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.100
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a local citizen.</v>

20
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>Right now we have it the other way round</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the other way round is deadly for</v>

21
00:01:19.841 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 1>this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we should all try to,</v>

22
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>through education systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through our children's,</v>

23
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>who the next generation pushed for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mindset.</v>

24
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>Because without that new mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that global citizenship mindset,</v>

25
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>even a new methodology like the one I</v>
<v Speaker 1>described would not be enough.</v>

26
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.450
<v Speaker 1>You need the combination of the two.</v>
