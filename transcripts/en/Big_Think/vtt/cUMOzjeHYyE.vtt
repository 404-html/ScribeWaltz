1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists and philosophers like to</v>

2
00:00:03.181 --> 00:00:08.181
<v Speaker 1>think that they're a very sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rational people who are</v>

3
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>above the need to advertise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet if you look closely,</v>

4
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:20.181
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that they often go to great</v>
<v Speaker 1>lengths to come up with a vivid,</v>

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.120
<v Speaker 1>memorable term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a label for their theory or a or a name</v>

6
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>for it that will stick in people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads.</v>

7
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to develop a brand name</v>

8
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>or advertising or trademark for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

9
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and we should recognize that's a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to do.</v>

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to run an example or if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to run an argument,</v>

11
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>try to make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>as easy as possible for the audience or</v>

12
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>the reader to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>keep track of the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't call them a,</v>

14
00:00:55.741 --> 00:00:56.371
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>

15
00:00:56.371 --> 00:00:59.740
<v Speaker 1>D and e called him bill and Arthur and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freddy and,</v>

16
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so forth.</v>

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>But of course that could backfire on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube,</v>

18
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it can be misused.</v>

19
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite bad thought</v>

20
00:01:10.081 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad intuition pumps is one in a very</v>

21
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>influential paper by green and Cohen</v>
<v Speaker 1>published in the proceedings of the</v>

22
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Royal Society on what neuroscience tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>us about freewill.</v>

23
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>And this is the boys from Brazil and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this thought experiment,</v>

24
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>a were to imagine this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's inspired by the hokey science</v>

25
00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>fiction film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the boys from Brazil about some evil</v>

26
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:46.701
<v Speaker 1>doctors who who clone Hitler and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make Hitler clones and but in</v>

27
00:01:47.281 --> 00:01:52.281
<v Speaker 1>in this telling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they create a human being who has been</v>

28
00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>designed by their evil intentions to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live a life of crime,</v>

29
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:01.560
<v Speaker 1>to do evil things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just as rational as anybody else,</v>

30
00:02:01.561 --> 00:02:06.561
<v Speaker 1>he's very much controlled the sort of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a designed psychopath and they</v>

31
00:02:09.121 --> 00:02:14.121
<v Speaker 1>call him Mr. Puppet</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they described Mr. puppet and Mr.</v>

32
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>puppet goes out and commits a crime and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they appeal to the readers.</v>

33
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>That to conclude that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Papa doesn't really responsible for</v>

34
00:02:27.421 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for his evil deeds.</v>

35
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't be punished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly he's just the victim of his</v>

36
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:37.671
<v Speaker 1>circumstances and then a blessed the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say now Daniel Dennett Mike Object,</v>

37
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>that this is just an intuition pump and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we shouldn't take it seriously.</v>

38
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that it's an intuition pump.</v>

39
00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Intuition pumps can be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

40
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a bad intuition pump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said they just having noticed,</v>

41
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>having imagined that I might be critical</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their pump,</v>

42
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>they go ahead and do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me now turn the knobs on this</v>

43
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>intuition pump and we'll see what we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>make of it.</v>

44
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>First they say the fact that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person was created by evil</v>

45
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>scientists with evil intent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's irrelevant to the example.</v>

46
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

47
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:18.640
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's get rid of them.</v>

48
00:03:18.641 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>We'll turn that in the oven.</v>

49
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the indifferent environment produces</v>

50
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.360
<v Speaker 1>a human being who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd say by design is set out on a</v>

52
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 1>sort of antisocial trajectory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>but we can get rid of that by design</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

54
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 1>because if it's an indifferent</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

55
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 1>then there's no intent on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we now we've got this,</v>

56
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:46.891
<v Speaker 1>an indifferent environment happens to</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce an individual who with high</v>

57
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>probability we'll engage in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal activities,</v>

58
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.850
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they imagined that,</v>

59
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>that he killed somebody in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a drug bust or something like,</v>

60
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a drug deal gone bad.</v>

61
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an essential.</v>

62
00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to change the crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make it.</v>

63
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he killed somebody who's witnessed some</v>

64
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>embezzlement that he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't make any difference.</v>

65
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.780
<v Speaker 1>If you thought that the Mr Puppet in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first instance wasn't responsible and</v>

66
00:04:21.881 --> 00:04:24.320
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be held responsible and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this shouldn't change it.</v>

67
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.590
<v Speaker 1>Now I want to change just one more</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

68
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>They keep talking about Mr. Puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a nice vivid name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just a name shouldn't make any</v>

70
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to change it.</v>

71
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Let's call Mr. Puppet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

72
00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>captain autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

73
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.980
<v Speaker 1>So now captain autonomy is caused by an</v>
<v Speaker 1>indifferent environment to enter on a</v>

74
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>trajectory where becomes likely that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to commit some anti social</v>

75
00:04:54.821 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

76
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the question is whether he should be</v>

77
00:04:59.831 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>held responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:05.050
<v Speaker 1>I think captain autonomy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why shouldn't he be held responsible?</v>

79
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Let me flesh it out a little bit more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

80
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>let's suppose it captain autonomy is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvard graduate,</v>

81
00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who goes to work at Lehman brothers and</v>

82
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.660
<v Speaker 1>he sees a clever way of embezzling a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars and has pulled off his,</v>

83
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.693
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

84
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
<v Speaker 1>white collar crime when he discovers a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person who has about to,</v>

85
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.220
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.723
<v Speaker 1>expose him.</v>

87
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:35.960
<v Speaker 1>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Louis him to the edge of the balcony and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high rise and pushes him off and he</v>

89
00:05:40.841 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>falls to his death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's my case.</v>

90
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we so clear that captain autonomy is</v>

91
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not responsible for his deed?</v>

92
00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.680
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that I drained the</v>
<v Speaker 1>example of most of the ones that</v>

93
00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.620
<v Speaker 1>provided the intuitions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that my retelling of it</v>

94
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.890
<v Speaker 1>shows that he is responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just pointing out that those details</v>

95
00:06:09.141 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>which presumably are ad Lib and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't,</v>

96
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make a huge difference into how we</v>

97
00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:19.810
<v Speaker 1>think about this person and whether or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to hold them responsible.</v>
