1
00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.190
<v Speaker 1>We're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see the elephant is a story</v>

2
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>about a young man who believes</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves to be the greatest writer in</v>

3
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is he hasn't written</v>

4
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a.</v>

5
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many young writers find themselves in.</v>

6
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.160
<v Speaker 1>He moves to San Francisco because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks of this as a romantic literary</v>

7
00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>city and a place for him to fulfill his</v>
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And he gets a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of sweet.</v>

9
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>Talks himself into a job at a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>called the morning trumpet,</v>

10
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>which is a third rate newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose,</v>

11
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heyday was probably an 1850 right after</v>

12
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the gold rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been going downhill ever since.</v>

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.120
<v Speaker 1>Even still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think slater brown,</v>

14
00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>the name of this young man is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong about it.</v>

15
00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>He just doesn't quite add up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to get rid of him,</v>

16
00:00:48.151 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're such a hot writer,</v>

17
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>go find us a story.</v>

18
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>And they're pretty sure they'll never</v>
<v Speaker 1>see him again.</v>

19
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he proceeds to go out into the city of</v>

20
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco to look for a story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 1>and a series of things happened to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in very short order,</v>

22
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>he's the most powerful person in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

23
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

24
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the nuts and bolts of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

25
00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I sat down,</v>

26
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>people asked me how I came to this idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was walking around San Francisco</v>

27
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>one day about seven years ago and I saw</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

28
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:22.251
<v Speaker 1>I saw my character in a coffee shop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the impetus for me to start to</v>

29
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>tell this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same character is in Dallas</v>

30
00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in New Orleans,</v>

31
00:01:27.271 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>he's in New York City's in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the romantic,</v>

32
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>idealized young man or woman who is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a passionate reader and had,</v>

33
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>wants to be a writer and now is on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process of figuring out how to get</v>

34
00:01:40.261 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what the book's theme</v>

35
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>is about on some level.</v>

36
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I'm probably a good judge</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my themes yet.</v>

37
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>I think there's still emerging and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think when I sit down to write,</v>

38
00:01:59.511 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm usually drawn in by something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard a,</v>

39
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a piece of dialogue or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe I've seen something.</v>

40
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's sort of the starting point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I started to write this book,</v>

41
00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>going to see the elephant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know where the end was,</v>

42
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.810
<v Speaker 1>which was a huge mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 1>and I also didn't know if I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:15.621 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like training for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

45
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>You believe you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.330
<v Speaker 1>you want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but can you do it?</v>

47
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.480
<v Speaker 1>And this book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 1>was a process of me figuring out how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that and writing it was a huge leap</v>

49
00:02:28.071 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>of faith for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

50
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier,</v>

51
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:36.011
<v Speaker 1>perhaps a benign mental illness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I'm themes are things that</v>

52
00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 1>are found after the fact and that most</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers don't consciously engage in that</v>

53
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.870
<v Speaker 1>or if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes their work suffers</v>

54
00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find my entry point into these things</v>

56
00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>to be more around characters or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular feeling or mood and not a,</v>

57
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to write a story about coming of</v>

58
00:03:01.281 --> 00:03:02.300
<v Speaker 1>age or something like that.</v>
