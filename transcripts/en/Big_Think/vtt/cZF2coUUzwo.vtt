00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>The 21st century is being shaped</v>

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 2>by heavily by technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 2>technology has always has always been</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful,</v>

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 2>powerful forces in history because it</v>
<v Speaker 2>sets the context and information and</v>

5
00:00:21.751 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 2>communications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology definitely shape our year or</v>

6
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 2>they connect people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make ideas and information more</v>

7
00:00:30.241 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 2>transparent and open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can topple regimes.</v>

8
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.600
<v Speaker 2>I fully believe that communism ended in</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern Europe because people became</v>

9
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 2>aware that they had choices and we're no</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer ready to settle for the local</v>

10
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>option and therefore support those</v>
<v Speaker 2>regimes.</v>

11
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 2>So technology can have very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very powerful social impact,</v>

12
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:55.080
<v Speaker 2>political impact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and set the context for everything we</v>

13
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:55.914
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

14
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know</v>

15
00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.000
<v Speaker 2>whether people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>humanity has an overarching purpose or</v>

16
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:10.001
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I do know that we connect with one</v>

17
00:01:10.281 --> 00:01:15.281
<v Speaker 2>another and that are legacies lie in</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people remember us for later.</v>

18
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.480
<v Speaker 2>I think we feel alive because we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>alive in the minds of other people and</v>

19
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:28.151
<v Speaker 2>therefore that might drive us not toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>the selfish side or the reptilian parts</v>

20
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 2>of our brain fight or flight and</v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive reactions.</v>

21
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:39.431
<v Speaker 2>But I think that idea that our identity</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes from being known to being cared</v>

22
00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:46.241
<v Speaker 2>about by other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should drive us to attempt to make more</v>

23
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 2>people aware that we have something</v>
<v Speaker 2>great to give to them.</v>

24
00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.390
<v Speaker 2>So part of my personal philosophy I get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so part of my personal philosophy also,</v>

25
00:01:56.961 --> 00:02:00.620
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that giving helps you receive.</v>

26
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I believe our purpose</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

27
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about where that stands</v>
<v Speaker 2>theologically,</v>

28
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.880
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that we are in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our lives on earth and,</v>

29
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 2>and also that we have to play the hands</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're dealt.</v>

30
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 2>I can't turn myself into some totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>different kind of person,</v>

31
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:27.070
<v Speaker 2>so I have to use what I have and if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>can resonate with other people,</v>

32
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>then my identity is strengthened and</v>
<v Speaker 2>enhanced and they will remember me</v>

33
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 2>afterwards wherever I go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then.</v>
