00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.650
<v Speaker 1>Culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.560
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why many of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing nations of the world continue</v>

4
00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:19.171
<v Speaker 1>to kind of depend on handouts for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they do not have an agricultural</v>

5
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:25.150
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure that allows them to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>self sufficient in food production is,</v>

6
00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:27.130
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the area of global trade,</v>

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really do not have very much free</v>

8
00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>trade and agriculture because it's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting phenomena.</v>

9
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:35.020
<v Speaker 1>No matter how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how rich or country is,</v>

10
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.500
<v Speaker 1>most farmers will want to protect what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have inside.</v>

11
00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>It's as true of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true of the UK,</v>

12
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it's true of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true of China's true of everywhere</v>

13
00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So agriculture is probably the reason</v>

14
00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:50.941
<v Speaker 1>why we cannot move very aggressively on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new global trade round.</v>

15
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>The agricultural interests are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty down on.</v>

16
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the area of agriculture,</v>

17
00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we as a nation have to do this</v>

19
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.160
<v Speaker 1>after recognize that vast areas of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world has subsistence agriculture and</v>

20
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.830
<v Speaker 1>our policies tend to hurt that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the way we subsidize our products.</v>

21
00:01:11.831 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make an overall</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement because some are more in that</v>

22
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>area than an than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not every one of our programs is</v>

23
00:01:17.771 --> 00:01:19.000
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

24
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture is unique.</v>

25
00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.160
<v Speaker 1>The politics of agriculture is unlike</v>
<v Speaker 1>any in the rest of the world.</v>

26
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.110
<v Speaker 1>You can be talking to the most liberal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressive politician in America or</v>

27
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:34.111
<v Speaker 1>Japan or in Europe on anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you mentioned dairy or cotton or</v>

28
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:38.350
<v Speaker 1>sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's like they turned from Dr Jekyll</v>

29
00:01:38.351 --> 00:01:39.640
<v Speaker 1>and Mr. Hyde.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

30
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way of the world and has</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably always been that way.</v>

31
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>And part of it is this natural</v>
<v Speaker 1>predilection to protect your farmers and</v>

32
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 1>your food supply.</v>
