1
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Not doing anything that's substantially</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

2
00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of the same techniques you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>up on Capitol Hill,</v>

3
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>you are trying to get journalists to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write things that are favorable to your</v>

4
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they don't write things favorable,</v>

5
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>you protest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>you do the same things that the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle association is.</v>

7
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:32.040
<v Speaker 1>You make sure that congressmen</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that if they take positions</v>

8
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:35.820
<v Speaker 1>contrary to what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to try to steer campaign</v>

9
00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:38.790
<v Speaker 1>contributions to the other side if at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all possible.</v>

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>So the nature of the activities is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty similar to what other powerful</v>

11
00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>groups do as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>why is social security a sacrosanct</v>
<v Speaker 1>third rail issue?</v>

13
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>It's because the arp has a position of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and they can organize their members</v>

14
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>and so politician who suddenly steps up</v>
<v Speaker 1>and says,</v>

15
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think social security audit be cut is</v>

16
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>going to be in real trouble for doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So at what they're doing is not all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

18
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>They are particularly good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're not doing anything that's</v>

19
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:12.501
<v Speaker 1>illegitimate with one exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the tendency to smear anybody</v>

20
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>who is critical of this relationship for</v>
<v Speaker 1>being antisemitic or being bigoted in</v>

21
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>some way though what happened to Jimmy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carter,</v>

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he published his book Palestine</v>

23
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a part that is a sort of classic</v>

24
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:29.670
<v Speaker 1>example of this where he was accused of</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a Nazi sympathizer accused of</v>

25
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>being a Jew hater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>

26
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>And this is a prEsident who had done as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much for israeli security as any</v>

27
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>american president ever has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I think is not legitimate because</v>

28
00:01:40.861 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>it gets in the way of a free and open</v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse,</v>

29
00:01:43.711 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>which is really essential in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>

30
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.560
<v Speaker 1>You could certAinly diminish the impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all special interest groups if you</v>

31
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>could have a really radical campaign</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance reform in the United States.</v>

32
00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't end interest group politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would take some of the fuel out</v>

33
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:05.880
<v Speaker 1>of it and that I don't think is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen in my lifetime because of course</v>

34
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.280
<v Speaker 1>that would get resisted by all special</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest groups.</v>

35
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>not any particular one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I think because there's nothing wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>with any group of americans,</v>

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizing to shape american foreign</v>

38
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>policy in ways that they think are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the country.</v>

39
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't favor putting any restrictions</v>

40
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>or limits or saying that you guys can</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize.</v>

41
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't come up on capital hill</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore and talk to congressmen.</v>

42
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I think anything like that would be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti american,</v>

43
00:02:31.771 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>very anti-democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I hope happens,</v>

44
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:40.191
<v Speaker 1>and I hope our book it helps encourage</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that some of the organizations in a</v>

45
00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 1>sort of broad coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't agree on everything by the</v>

46
00:02:45.451 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some of the more moderate groups</v>

47
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>and more progressive become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>influential,</v>

48
00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.540
<v Speaker 1>gain more supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.600
<v Speaker 1>and similarly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the more powerful groups now</v>

50
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 1>thAt tend to be more hardline begin to</v>
<v Speaker 1>rethink their positions.</v>

51
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I would have no objection to there being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very powerful pro Israel community in</v>

52
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>the United States if I thought the</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies they were pushing for were</v>

53
00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>better for us and better for Israel as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

54
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have no problem with there being</v>

55
00:03:10.821 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>the lobby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wish it were pushing for policies</v>

56
00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>that were smarter.</v>
