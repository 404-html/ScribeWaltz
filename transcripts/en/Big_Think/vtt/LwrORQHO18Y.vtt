WEBVTT

1
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>With us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we,</v>

2
00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>most military don't look at it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't calculate that.</v>

3
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>I might not come home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 1>that's like a factor that's never</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculated it into our decision making</v>

5
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our biggest thing is we might let the</v>

6
00:00:24.431 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>guy down next to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for us it's our training,</v>

7
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of go over there and execute our</v>

8
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our biggest thing in the marine</v>

9
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>corps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pushes that mission,</v>

10
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:36.070
<v Speaker 1>accomplishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplishment and troop</v>

11
00:00:36.071 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 1>welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think with that mindset we go in,</v>

12
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.140
<v Speaker 1>we're already pretty prepared for what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to go on,</v>

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

14
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 1>for me engaging the enemy or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always kind of thought I was doing</v>

15
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>what I was trained to do and I kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>separated emotion from it.</v>

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten better at it over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every deployment I went back,</v>

18
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I understood that in motion.</v>

19
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.550
<v Speaker 1>His only weakness over here for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must think objectively.</v>

20
00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a general maddis always says a phrase,</v>

21
00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:01.720
<v Speaker 1>no better friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no worse enemy.</v>

22
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.380
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's like the best thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because really it's,</v>

23
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>it kind of explains what the fighting</v>
<v Speaker 1>man has to kind of do over there.</v>

24
00:01:08.321 --> 00:01:09.970
<v Speaker 1>But it's very hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to go over there without</v>

25
00:01:09.971 --> 00:01:10.950
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

26
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after one of your friends gets hit by a</v>

27
00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:14.530
<v Speaker 1>roadside bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard not to be pissed,</v>

28
00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is you got to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

29
00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:18.220
<v Speaker 1>this is the nature of the beast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to drive on.</v>

30
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to take it out on other</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraqis that aren't involved,</v>

31
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.053
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

32
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got hit by a rocket pro grenade and</v>

33
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.210
<v Speaker 1>April seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004,</v>

34
00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:32.150
<v Speaker 1>nine and the initial push into Falucia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.000
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>

36
00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:36.500
<v Speaker 1>we got slammed right going into an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ambush and,</v>

37
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were the point vehicle.</v>

38
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I blew off my assistant team leader at</v>
<v Speaker 1>both his hands,</v>

40
00:01:41.421 --> 00:01:42.254
<v Speaker 1>Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it broke my arm,</v>

42
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>blew up my trigger finger and did a it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wounded everyone else in my vehicle.</v>

43
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.561
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we did,</v>

44
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.230
<v Speaker 1>we pushed out of the kill zone and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually got stuck in a secondary kill</v>

45
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.620
<v Speaker 1>where we were surrounded by about 26</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys.</v>

47
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.513
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.960
<v Speaker 1>we had to do medical aid to ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I put a tourniquet on and uh,</v>

49
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>one of my young Lance Corporal Lance</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corporal Meson actually tourniqueted um,</v>

50
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>up Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

51
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 1>for us it was actually kind of funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause this is like that Marine Corps</v>

52
00:02:07.761 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 1>humor that you see throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>series.</v>

53
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>And he writes in the backseat cracking</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes and the guy has no hands.</v>

54
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's like calm breeds calm.</v>

55
00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:16.790
<v Speaker 1>So I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>

56
00:02:16.791 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>if this guy is laughing about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 1>how can I be worried?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not as bad as he is.</v>

58
00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.130
<v Speaker 1>And he actually made a bad situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of somewhat entertaining.</v>

59
00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And then we just went back and we just</v>
<v Speaker 1>executed what we trained for cause and</v>

60
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high levels of stress.</v>

61
00:02:30.291 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>You always resort back to your last</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest level of training.</v>

62
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my third combat tour.</v>

63
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.340
<v Speaker 1>So it wasn't like I was worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

64
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>I just kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was muscle memory.</v>

65
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I did whatever we had to do to survive</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

66
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>We got back out of the kill zone and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 1>probably about an hour and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two hours later we were metal backed out</v>

68
00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:46.664
<v Speaker 1>of there.</v>

69
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 1>I always kind of promised that I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna I was gonna make things right for</v>

70
00:02:52.781 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Eddie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just Kinda,</v>

71
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after seeing him in the hospital that</v>

72
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:58.540
<v Speaker 1>actually brought me to tears to him in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Icu.</v>

73
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.430
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

74
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.051
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say.</v>

75
00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:05.420
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say I wanted to go kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people to get back,</v>

76
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge because you know,</v>

77
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.030
<v Speaker 1>then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of,</v>

78
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using my emotion part.</v>

79
00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:13.940
<v Speaker 1>But I wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make it feel like that we</v>

80
00:03:13.941 --> 00:03:16.460
<v Speaker 1>were wounded that day for something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:03:16.461 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't for nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to get back there and,</v>

82
00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:22.580
<v Speaker 1>and try and fix the problems Iraq had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that meant fight him and fight if</v>

83
00:03:22.581 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>that man fix the infrastructure or</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with the local Iraqis,</v>

84
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>do whatever I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever's in my power to make that</v>

85
00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:29.600
<v Speaker 1>place better.</v>

86
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.250
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot because my fourth and</v>

87
00:03:31.251 --> 00:03:33.830
<v Speaker 1>fifth tours are totally different than</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you see in generation kill.</v>

88
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what I did is actually live</v>

89
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.410
<v Speaker 1>with the Iraqis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>now to 24 man platoon and we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we created kind of an atmosphere where</v>

91
00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 1>they can be safe or they're around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We learned off them,</v>

92
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>we learned everything from how to cook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

93
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.540
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were flatbread are Hovis to how to</v>

94
00:03:50.541 --> 00:03:54.260
<v Speaker 1>hook up a Italian porn on their tvs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching them how to patrol.</v>

95
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:03:56.271 --> 00:03:58.040
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working with these people closely</v>

97
00:03:58.041 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>and try and get rid of everything from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the criminal annulment.</v>

98
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.090
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's like running loose in Iraq to</v>

99
00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>work with the terrorist and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other elements that are there cause</v>

100
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's very complex and I learned so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more in my,</v>

101
00:04:08.301 --> 00:04:10.760
<v Speaker 1>my fourth and fifth tour then you then I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could ever imagine,</v>

102
00:04:10.761 --> 00:04:14.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean I kind of look back at my first</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple tours and it's like,</v>

103
00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:15.770
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I knew what I knew now,</v>

104
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could have done such a better job</v>

105
00:04:17.421 --> 00:04:18.254
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>

106
00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>We did it on this place called pork chop</v>
<v Speaker 1>island is like a,</v>

107
00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I think in the history of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone's been injured on</v>

108
00:04:26.401 --> 00:04:27.810
<v Speaker 1>that island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

109
00:04:27.811 --> 00:04:29.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me it's like getting back on the</v>

110
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:32.580
<v Speaker 1>horse and I was actually paranoid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually kind of how well it must be.</v>

111
00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:33.730
<v Speaker 1>What captain America fell in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

112
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:35.490
<v Speaker 1>I have one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very paranoid because I was</v>

113
00:04:35.491 --> 00:04:38.220
<v Speaker 1>calculating and everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every comment I've seen in the past,</v>

114
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.500
<v Speaker 1>like possible ambushes that can go down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything.</v>

115
00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:43.140
<v Speaker 1>And my mind was just racing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

116
00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.221
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

117
00:04:44.221 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did I come back here?</v>

118
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.183
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

119
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I think after I got over it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just like one day of extreme</v>

120
00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 1>paranoia for some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

121
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after that,</v>

122
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 1>I went back to just push an emotion to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the side and doing my job.</v>

123
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.580
<v Speaker 1>And I had no.</v>
