1
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Or the primary objective of the World</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank is to help developing countries</v>

2
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>grow and develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And our main objective is to help</v>

3
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>countries reduce poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the World Bank has a long history of</v>

4
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>working in China on different types of</v>
<v Speaker 1>projects that have helped reduce</v>

5
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>but personally I interpret this mandate</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite broadly.</v>

7
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.540
<v Speaker 1>I moved to China three years ago for</v>
<v Speaker 1>this assignment and I've come to think</v>

8
00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:34.650
<v Speaker 1>that the key challenge that China faces</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really environmental management,</v>

9
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.800
<v Speaker 1>natural resource scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.920
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy,</v>

11
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:42.240
<v Speaker 1>these key resource issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that the impressive poverty</v>

12
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:46.920
<v Speaker 1>reduction that China has achieved is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be sustainable unless China</v>

13
00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>really comes to grip with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental challenges.</v>

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So on a practical level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to shift our World Bank</v>

15
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>program to support a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental activities in China,</v>

16
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
<v Speaker 1>in the water sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing new energy sources.</v>

17
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.881
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

18
00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:07.881
<v Speaker 1>we financed the first big wind power</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind power station in China and</v>

19
00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>demonstrated that this is economically</v>
<v Speaker 1>viable.</v>

20
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>We finance different types of clean</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy technologies.</v>

21
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>So I guess I see what I'm doing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with Chinese partners to help</v>

22
00:01:19.171 --> 00:01:21.740
<v Speaker 1>them address some of their key</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges and,</v>

23
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>and that goes beyond environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of our work now is focused on</v>

24
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>the environmental area.</v>
