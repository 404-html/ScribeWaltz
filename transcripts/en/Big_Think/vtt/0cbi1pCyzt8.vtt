1
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.190
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's the old saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who said it,</v>

2
00:00:08.191 --> 00:00:13.191
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's was turned my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is if at the age of 21,</v>

3
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a socialist,</v>

4
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any heart.</v>

5
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.463
<v Speaker 1>And if by the age 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still are and then you don't have </v>

6
00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:26.130
<v Speaker 1>any brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was kind of my experience.</v>

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I started out young and idealistic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>social justice and fair distribution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

9
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:34.644
<v Speaker 1>And we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand where everybody </v>

10
00:00:36.541 --> 00:00:41.541
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be equally prosperous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And starting my own business,</v>

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.823
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kind of a wake up call and a number </v>

12
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 1>of different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

13
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.803
<v Speaker 1>I had to meet a payroll every week and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to satisfy customers and we had </v>

14
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>competitors that we had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>compete with in order to have those </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers come into our stores.</v>

16
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>And we had to compete with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>employers for our,</v>

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our employees.</v>

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.673
<v Speaker 1>We had to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wages were under competitive </v>

19
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:10.344
<v Speaker 1>pressures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was all this competition on us </v>

20
00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:13.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>that of course made the operating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>business successfully difficult.</v>

22
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.253
<v Speaker 1>And it's kind of like having to meet a </v>
<v Speaker 1>payroll and having to meet the demands </v>

23
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:23.484
<v Speaker 1>of our customers is a great a destroyer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Utopian fantasies and utopia and </v>

24
00:01:29.671 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>utopia and ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

25
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you're in the real world and you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

26
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.260
<v Speaker 1>you have to meet the market test every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and every week.</v>

27
00:01:37.261 --> 00:01:38.094
<v Speaker 1>And I just found that the belief system </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had going into operating that </v>

28
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:43.344
<v Speaker 1>business was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was inadequate to explain the </v>

29
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>experiences that I was having in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

30
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:49.254
<v Speaker 1>And I began to look around and read </v>
<v Speaker 1>other books and other philosophies to </v>

31
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:56.424
<v Speaker 1>try and make sense out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of my life and out of my business </v>

32
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.084
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was really through encountering </v>

33
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:02.663
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free market capitalist philosophies </v>

34
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

35
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Milton Friedman and,</v>

36
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Friedrich Hayak and Lou [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

39
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>and many other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>free market philosophers that I came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that this explanation made a lot</v>

41
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:25.194
<v Speaker 1>more sense in my business experience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>made more sense in terms of how the </v>

42
00:02:27.751 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>world really operated.</v>

43
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.353
<v Speaker 1>And so that's when my worldview began to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift and I began to let go of being a </v>

44
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>sort of a democratic socialist.</v>

45
00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:45.683
<v Speaker 1>Any type of political ideology is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a lot of different variants of </v>

46
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of different,</v>

47
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>libertarians are,</v>

48
00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.710
<v Speaker 1>are constantly arguing with each,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>who's the most pure libertarian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's most Aila,</v>

50
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.330
<v Speaker 1>ideologically pure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

51
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I have no real interest in those types </v>
<v Speaker 1>of discussions or arguments.</v>

52
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I resist in one of the strains of </v>

54
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:15.094
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism and I reject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I reject the idea that humankind is </v>

55
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:21.250
<v Speaker 1>essentially selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

56
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only as an observation that we </v>

57
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>frequently are selfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a strain of belief,</v>

58
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the,</v>

59
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>in the Ein Rand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the movement that the leaves </v>

61
00:03:33.371 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 1>people ought to be selfish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

62
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>that that's a virtue that humans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>always self interested in.</v>

63
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:45.160
<v Speaker 1>And all truism is evil and love is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 1>is something that makes us weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I reject that aspect of allude to</v>

65
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

66
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a caring,</v>

67
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:58.561
<v Speaker 1>compassionate person and I believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>free markets and free minds leads to the</v>

68
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.104
<v Speaker 1>greatest human flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I really want humans to flourish and </v>

69
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.364
<v Speaker 1>I believe liberty and market economies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and capitalism and the best strategies </v>

70
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:12.694
<v Speaker 1>for full human flourishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't identify with that strain of </v>

71
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 1>libertarianism that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of uncaring and,</v>

73
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

75
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Darwinian,</v>

76
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.050
<v Speaker 1>a variant of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm very uncomfortable without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

78
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm not that way myself.</v>

79
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that many libertarians are </v>
<v Speaker 1>animated by a human flourishing.</v>

80
00:04:43.481 --> 00:04:44.410
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

81
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:45.723
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sincerely believe that human </v>

82
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:52.330
<v Speaker 1>flourishing is that we need to be free </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we need to be creative.</v>

83
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And that through human freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship,</v>

84
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that humans are creative,</v>

85
00:05:00.251 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>they create new ways of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:04.024
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of creating value for each other that </v>

87
00:05:05.621 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>expresses itself through the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system and leads to greater prosperity.</v>

88
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Not for a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for,</v>

89
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>for most people and eventually all </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

90
00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 1>So there is a strain of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

91
00:05:17.561 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 1>of deep idealism in the libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

92
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes masta over by that,</v>

93
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ideology of selfishness.</v>

94
00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.310
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 1>the human flourishing element is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely a big aspect of,</v>

96
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of the motivational structure of</v>

97
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many libertarian.</v>

98
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:40.624
<v Speaker 1>Certainly it is for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the zero sum worldview is the </v>

99
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>predominant one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something we've,</v>

101
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.430
<v Speaker 1>we've evolved with this idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

102
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.613
<v Speaker 1>a limited fixed pie and we have to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribute that pie and equal fairway </v>

103
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 1>that no one should get a unfair large </v>
<v Speaker 1>pieces of that pie.</v>

104
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>And if someone is getting a bigger piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>

105
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:14.864
<v Speaker 1>someone else may be getting a smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece since there's a finite amount of </v>

106
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:20.900
<v Speaker 1>pie to go around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also think it's comes from our,</v>

107
00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.260
<v Speaker 1>our competitive sports and that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive sports there's a,</v>

108
00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a winner and there's a loser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we play games,</v>

109
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:31.814
<v Speaker 1>we play sports all our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we come to believe that that in the </v>

110
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:37.214
<v Speaker 1>zero sum worldview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that summer winters and some are losers </v>

111
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we can adjust society,</v>

112
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>that there should be no losers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there should be a,</v>

113
00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>and so we need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

114
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:49.663
<v Speaker 1>to limit the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pieces of the pie anyone gets so </v>

115
00:06:52.491 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>that everyone can have a fair and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of the Pie.</v>

116
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I reject that.</v>

117
00:06:58.041 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.813
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a fixed pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beauty of capitalism and the beauty </v>

119
00:07:04.221 --> 00:07:09.221
<v Speaker 1>of conscious capitalism is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>realization that the pie can grow that,</v>

120
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.903
<v Speaker 1>that through voluntary exchange in </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the value creation that happens </v>

121
00:07:16.011 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 1>when the stakeholders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.950
<v Speaker 1>voluntarily cooperate and voluntary </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange,</v>

123
00:07:19.951 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 1>which with each other is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the pie grows larger.</v>

124
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.223
<v Speaker 1>And so there is more to distribute and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that distribution takes place through </v>

125
00:07:29.211 --> 00:07:30.090
<v Speaker 1>the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.860
<v Speaker 1>for the mark to market process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the exchange process as each,</v>

127
00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>as each of the traders of course wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a bigger piece for themselves.</v>

128
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>And competition sort of ultimately </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines the,</v>

129
00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the percentages that each of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different constituencies or stakeholders</v>

130
00:07:46.761 --> 00:07:51.470
<v Speaker 1>gets in the exchanges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's a growing pie and it's a win,</v>

131
00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:52.310
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>

132
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win game.</v>

133
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:58.990
<v Speaker 1>And that turns me on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very fired up and excited about that</v>

134
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>because it means human flourishing isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>trapped in some type of,</v>

135
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.740
<v Speaker 1>limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set of constraints.</v>

138
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:12.050
<v Speaker 1>It means we can innovate and create our </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways out of the knee.</v>

139
00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>These traps in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember or think of the phrase </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

142
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to recall,</v>

143
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.030
<v Speaker 1>but this idea that we're in some type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

144
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.053
<v Speaker 1>of trap of limited resources and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only limitations we have in the </v>

145
00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>limitations of human creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human imagination and,</v>

146
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.233
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual capital that's been </v>

147
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>accumulated as we continue to gain an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual,</v>

148
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.553
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital and his human creativity is </v>

149
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 1>unleashed and human entrepreneurship is </v>
<v Speaker 1>unleashed.</v>

150
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Then the new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new innovations,</v>

151
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 1>the new creativity that expresses itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the marketplace,</v>

152
00:08:52.071 --> 00:08:55.470
<v Speaker 1>through capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allows us to solve that.</v>

153
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Previously were thought to be insoluble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.180
<v Speaker 1>and human and humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>continue on the upward spiral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

156
00:09:02.671 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 1>a great example of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

157
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.304
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are very focused oftentimes on </v>

158
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:08.154
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's still a billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>people on this planet that say live on </v>

159
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 1>less than a dollar a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

160
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:12.714
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's certainly is a terrible </v>

161
00:09:13.591 --> 00:09:14.424
<v Speaker 1>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you put that in historical </v>

162
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:20.610
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's about 15% of the people.</v>

163
00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:21.511
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

164
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

165
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>less than 20% of the people alive on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet live on less than a dollar a day.</v>

166
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.353
<v Speaker 1>Whereas 200 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>85% of the people alive on the planet </v>

167
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>earth lived on less than a dollar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

168
00:09:32.851 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And the US in today's dollars adjusted </v>
<v Speaker 1>for inflation.</v>

169
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.880
<v Speaker 1>So poverty has always been the default </v>
<v Speaker 1>condition of the human race.</v>

170
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>What's unprecedented is not poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's unprecedented is wealth.</v>

171
00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.650
<v Speaker 1>Wealth for not a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but prosperity for literally billions of</v>

172
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>people every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

173
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:54.924
<v Speaker 1>Now we see hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people escape from poverty just in two </v>

174
00:09:58.231 --> 00:09:59.880
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and India.</v>

175
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It is the greatest revolution in human </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity in all of human history.</v>

176
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>It's all occurred in the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

177
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:10.524
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact that you almost never see </v>

178
00:10:13.531 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>reported in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

179
00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:19.540
<v Speaker 1>we tend to focus still on there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the remaining people that are po,</v>

180
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>

181
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>are the rapport and we're back on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero sum gain at some higher nother.</v>

182
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.673
<v Speaker 1>That's because other people are greedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and selfish and they're keeping these </v>

183
00:10:29.161 --> 00:10:29.994
<v Speaker 1>poor people down rather than seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty lesson through capitalism and </v>

184
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:36.930
<v Speaker 1>through free market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:10:37.290 --> 00:10:38.920
<v Speaker 1>expansion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.803
<v Speaker 1>we tend to condemn the very thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing people to escape from poverty </v>

187
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>as the cause of the poverty.</v>

188
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

189
00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.393
<v Speaker 1>the capitalism and free markets or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to allow us to escape from </v>

190
00:10:53.671 --> 00:10:56.160
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Yunus likes to say that,</v>

191
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:57.503
<v Speaker 1>that by the end of the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty will be something that we only </v>

192
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>see in museums that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

193
00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>it'll be something people look back on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

194
00:11:06.751 --> 00:11:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to have poor people.</v>

195
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:09.630
<v Speaker 1>How did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

196
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.463
<v Speaker 1>how is that even possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that's the future of </v>

197
00:11:13.171 --> 00:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>humanity if we don't totally mess it up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are going to continue to learn.</v>

198
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have our intellectual </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital spread.</v>

199
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:24.000
<v Speaker 1>We're going to unleash the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

200
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I do believe humans have </v>

201
00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:26.783
<v Speaker 1>limitless creativity and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve a lot of these problems that are </v>

202
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:33.420
<v Speaker 1>holding us back now and humanity is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to continue to its upward spiral.</v>

203
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>And then we're gonna eliminate poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are people alive today.</v>

204
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.433
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I perhaps will not live to see the end </v>

205
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:40.254
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are young people alive today </v>

206
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:46.491
<v Speaker 1>that we'll probably see the virtual end </v>
<v Speaker 1>of poverty in the human race in the 21st</v>

207
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:47.544
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

208
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.663
<v Speaker 1>From a macro perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious capitalism is becoming </v>

209
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:02.911
<v Speaker 1>conscious of the framework that </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism has to exist him in order to,</v>

210
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:06.220
<v Speaker 1>in order to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to flourish.</v>

211
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:07.054
<v Speaker 1>There certain key principles that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to be in place and we have to </v>

212
00:12:11.621 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>nurture those principles or we won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a capitalistic order.</v>

213
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.460
<v Speaker 1>It's not something that automatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist and has to be.</v>

214
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.030
<v Speaker 1>It has to have principles as to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in those principles.</v>

215
00:12:22.031 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 1>And some of those principles include,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

216
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.393
<v Speaker 1>property rights that we have to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right for people to be able to own </v>

218
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 1>property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

219
00:12:33.731 --> 00:12:35.980
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be the freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange property.</v>

220
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.933
<v Speaker 1>We need to be able to trade it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to be able to create something </v>

221
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 1>and then trade it or sell it to someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

222
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>We need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a rule of law.</v>

223
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:47.373
<v Speaker 1>There needs to be laws that are just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and laws that are predictable and laws </v>

224
00:12:53.681 --> 00:12:56.680
<v Speaker 1>that apply to everyone in the society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the government.</v>

225
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And the rule of law is essential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot have a,</v>

226
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:03.280
<v Speaker 1>a capitalistic order without the rule of</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

227
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.353
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever that comes into doubt or if </v>

228
00:13:06.911 --> 00:13:09.580
<v Speaker 1>they're not stable property rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really have the,</v>

229
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.020
<v Speaker 1>the basis for the capitalistic order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally you need a,</v>

230
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:17.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom to trade,</v>

232
00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:18.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

233
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>usually the greater the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:25.000
<v Speaker 1>the fewer restrictions on their freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>to trade across the,</v>

235
00:13:25.001 --> 00:13:25.834
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:26.873
<v Speaker 1>between people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also between people in different </v>

237
00:13:29.051 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in different countries,</v>

238
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.630
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greater value creation that occurs.</v>

239
00:13:34.631 --> 00:13:37.160
<v Speaker 1>So anytime you see a society that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to um,</v>

240
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.673
<v Speaker 1>restrict the ability to trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see a society that is going to </v>

241
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:43.054
<v Speaker 1>lessen its prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It a and P it tends to happen when </v>

242
00:13:46.331 --> 00:13:48.580
<v Speaker 1>people get preoccupied with the loss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

243
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:49.893
<v Speaker 1>Not Understanding that you may lose some</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs to a foreign country if you allow </v>

244
00:13:56.621 --> 00:13:59.980
<v Speaker 1>freedom to trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you gaining jobs at the same time,</v>

245
00:13:59.981 --> 00:14:00.814
<v Speaker 1>your gain more net jobs because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people won't give you their goods for </v>

246
00:14:04.211 --> 00:14:06.340
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to trade with you as well.</v>

247
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.203
<v Speaker 1>And so those jobs and the goods that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to trade for the good and </v>

248
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:12.790
<v Speaker 1>services they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will create greater employment,</v>

249
00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:13.631
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at home.</v>

250
00:14:13.631 --> 00:14:17.050
<v Speaker 1>But that's very hard for the average </v>
<v Speaker 1>person to understand.</v>

251
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

252
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:19.953
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious capitalism is understanding </v>

253
00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:22.474
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these basic core economic values and </v>

254
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:28.000
<v Speaker 1>becoming more conscious of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now conscious,</v>

255
00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business is,</v>

256
00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.290
<v Speaker 1>is there are certain principles behind </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

257
00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:36.124
<v Speaker 1>And one principle is that business has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential for higher purpose that </v>

258
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maximizing profits.</v>

259
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>If you ask people what the purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>

260
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:46.744
<v Speaker 1>they usually say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go to a cocktail party and asked </v>

261
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:49.360
<v Speaker 1>that question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll generally say,</v>

262
00:14:49.361 --> 00:14:50.194
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody knows that the purpose of of </v>

263
00:14:52.071 --> 00:14:55.910
<v Speaker 1>businesses to maximize profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to maximize shareholder value.</v>

264
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:57.553
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a very odd answer because </v>

265
00:14:59.121 --> 00:14:59.954
<v Speaker 1>that's not the answer we would give if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked what the purpose of a doctor </v>

266
00:15:01.971 --> 00:15:02.804
<v Speaker 1>is to heal the sick or what the purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it teacher is to educate people or </v>

267
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:08.683
<v Speaker 1>what the purpose of lawyer is or what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of an architect is or what </v>

268
00:15:11.301 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of an engineer is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

269
00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:14.023
<v Speaker 1>so why is it that we would come to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>on answer that the purpose of business </v>

270
00:15:16.821 --> 00:15:17.654
<v Speaker 1>is to maximize profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I have known literally hundreds of </v>

271
00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs in my life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with very few exceptions,</v>

272
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 1>very few of them actually created their </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses to try to maximize profits.</v>

273
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Of course they need to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's,</v>

274
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.840
<v Speaker 1>I need to eat in order to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to breathe in order to live.</v>

275
00:15:35.841 --> 00:15:36.674
<v Speaker 1>I need my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to create red blood cells in </v>

276
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:38.930
<v Speaker 1>order to live.</v>

277
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.630
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the purpose of my life to</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat,</v>

278
00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:44.510
<v Speaker 1>to breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to create red blood cells.</v>

279
00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't much more transcendent purpose</v>

280
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:48.044
<v Speaker 1>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives my life meaning and value to </v>

281
00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:51.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business is no different.</v>

282
00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

283
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.730
<v Speaker 1>business has the potential for a higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>and deeper purpose.</v>

284
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:58.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's the first principle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious business.</v>

285
00:15:58.490 --> 00:15:59.323
<v Speaker 1>Second principle is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a variety of </v>

286
00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.790
<v Speaker 1>stakeholders that are interdependent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are connected together,</v>

287
00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.220
<v Speaker 1>customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>

288
00:16:07.221 --> 00:16:09.440
<v Speaker 1>suppliers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>

289
00:16:10.190 --> 00:16:13.190
<v Speaker 1>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both local and larger communities.</v>

290
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:14.443
<v Speaker 1>And then the larger environment that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were part of those are the most </v>

291
00:16:16.671 --> 00:16:18.890
<v Speaker 1>important stake holders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are other stakeholders that are in</v>

292
00:16:18.891 --> 00:16:21.150
<v Speaker 1>like an form of wider circle such as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>

294
00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:24.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor unions,</v>

295
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media activists of various kinds.</v>

296
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:29.650
<v Speaker 1>But the idea being that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

297
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:31.003
<v Speaker 1>these stakeholders are interdependent on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one another and that the conscious </v>

298
00:16:34.461 --> 00:16:35.294
<v Speaker 1>business attempts to create value </v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously for all of these </v>

299
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:42.350
<v Speaker 1>interdependent stakeholders that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeks to win,</v>

300
00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:43.970
<v Speaker 1>win,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win business strategy.</v>

301
00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:45.223
<v Speaker 1>That in maybe a way to explain that in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple model version is a retail </v>

302
00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:50.620
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which whole foods is,</v>

303
00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.910
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

304
00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:57.940
<v Speaker 1>management's job is to help our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to hire good people,</v>

305
00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:03.560
<v Speaker 1>train them well and helped him to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happy and fulfilled in their workplace,</v>

306
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:04.423
<v Speaker 1>in their work and their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the team member's job is to </v>

307
00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:09.193
<v Speaker 1>satisfy our customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>help the customers to be happy in their </v>

308
00:17:12.171 --> 00:17:13.004
<v Speaker 1>exchanges with the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So happy team members leads to happy </v>

309
00:17:16.521 --> 00:17:20.210
<v Speaker 1>customers and happy customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do more business with the,</v>

310
00:17:20.211 --> 00:17:22.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the company and that leads to happy</v>

311
00:17:22.221 --> 00:17:23.054
<v Speaker 1>investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have a virtuous circle of happy </v>

312
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:28.910
<v Speaker 1>team members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy customers,</v>

313
00:17:28.911 --> 00:17:30.800
<v Speaker 1>happy investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

314
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:31.663
<v Speaker 1>that reflects in a simplified version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea of the interdependent nature </v>

315
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:36.494
<v Speaker 1>of the stakeholders and why you can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>just focus on creating value for the </v>

316
00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:40.274
<v Speaker 1>investors alone because you must create </v>
<v Speaker 1>value for the team members who then </v>

317
00:17:45.741 --> 00:17:49.530
<v Speaker 1>create value for the customers who then </v>
<v Speaker 1>create value for the investors.</v>

318
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:51.130
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

319
00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.133
<v Speaker 1>the conscious business is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizes as conscious of it and works </v>

320
00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:59.610
<v Speaker 1>to optimize value for all of the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

321
00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:01.110
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or dependent stakeholders.</v>

322
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:03.413
<v Speaker 1>Third principle of the conscious </v>
<v Speaker 1>business is what we call conscious </v>

323
00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:09.330
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you might also think of it as servant</v>

324
00:18:09.331 --> 00:18:13.050
<v Speaker 1>leadership that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the leaders of the organization,</v>

325
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.213
<v Speaker 1>they're not there to line their pockets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and try to maximize their own personal </v>

326
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:19.320
<v Speaker 1>gain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

327
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.920
<v Speaker 1>they're job is to fulfill the higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose of the business,</v>

328
00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:24.653
<v Speaker 1>recognize and fulfill the interdependent</v>
<v Speaker 1>stakeholder model and in a sense to </v>

329
00:18:28.591 --> 00:18:33.120
<v Speaker 1>serve the organization to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

330
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:34.343
<v Speaker 1>sublimate their own ego and their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambitions for the good of the </v>

331
00:18:37.411 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

332
00:18:39.001 --> 00:18:43.050
<v Speaker 1>it's not self sacrificial or I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about altruism,</v>

333
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about recognizing that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the long term they will also gain the </v>

334
00:18:47.791 --> 00:18:48.624
<v Speaker 1>most through the flourishing of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and through flourishing of all </v>

335
00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.300
<v Speaker 1>the stakeholders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they too will flourish,</v>

336
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 1>that their identity is linked and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>

337
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:58.913
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own gain is linked to the gain of </v>

338
00:19:01.651 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 1>all these other stakeholders.</v>

339
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:04.223
<v Speaker 1>And then the fourth principle is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that to realize these first three </v>

340
00:19:06.571 --> 00:19:08.340
<v Speaker 1>principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to create a culture,</v>

341
00:19:08.341 --> 00:19:12.630
<v Speaker 1>a conscious culture that has strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>

342
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.720
<v Speaker 1>and processes that create a culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimizes the stakeholder model,</v>

343
00:19:22.621 --> 00:19:27.621
<v Speaker 1>fills the purpose and allows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious leadership to do their jobs.</v>

344
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.643
<v Speaker 1>So the culture provides that background </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the processes and structures that </v>

345
00:19:35.671 --> 00:19:37.800
<v Speaker 1>the conscious business needs in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

346
00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve its highest potential.</v>

347
00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.990
<v Speaker 1>So when you add those four principles </v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

348
00:19:42.991 --> 00:19:47.550
<v Speaker 1>you have a conscious business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you add the conscious business with</v>

349
00:19:47.551 --> 00:19:48.384
<v Speaker 1>the key principles of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the conscious of the conscious </v>

350
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:52.824
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you truly have the larger ecosystem of </v>

351
00:19:57.781 --> 00:19:58.614
<v Speaker 1>the conscious capitalistic society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one with conscious businesses that are </v>

352
00:20:03.841 --> 00:20:08.250
<v Speaker 1>changing in a consciously a capitalistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

353
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.160
<v Speaker 1>You've just articulated what I call the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tradeoff myth.</v>

354
00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:18.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the belief that all this sounds very </v>

355
00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:22.680
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very idealistic,</v>

356
00:20:22.681 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but it won't compete well in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>marketplace.</v>

357
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:27.060
<v Speaker 1>And when it runs up against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

358
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.810
<v Speaker 1>a business that's not handicapped with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

359
00:20:30.811 --> 00:20:32.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>idealism,</v>

360
00:20:32.371 --> 00:20:35.940
<v Speaker 1>then it'll be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing could be further from the truth.</v>

361
00:20:35.941 --> 00:20:36.774
<v Speaker 1>It's exact opposite that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious business has competitive </v>

362
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:44.640
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you work from a higher purpose,</v>

363
00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:45.853
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you unleash greater degrees of </v>

364
00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:53.911
<v Speaker 1>commitment to greater degrees of loyalty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and greater creativity in the workplace.</v>

365
00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:55.683
<v Speaker 1>And that gives competitive advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you work from the stakeholder </v>

366
00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.730
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

367
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:03.010
<v Speaker 1>you understand that you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimize the entire system.</v>

368
00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.540
<v Speaker 1>You're able to do that in such a way is </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you optimize the entire system,</v>

369
00:21:07.541 --> 00:21:10.110
<v Speaker 1>you also optimize the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

370
00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:11.123
<v Speaker 1>the value that you also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're creating for the investors as </v>

371
00:21:13.451 --> 00:21:14.284
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The business tends to flourish at a </v>

372
00:21:16.031 --> 00:21:16.960
<v Speaker 1>higher level.</v>

373
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:17.973
<v Speaker 1>So in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conscious business will win in most </v>

374
00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.450
<v Speaker 1>instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All other things being equal,</v>

375
00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it will win in competition against less </v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious businesses.</v>

376
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's why I'm confident that over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the long term,</v>

377
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.260
<v Speaker 1>conscious capitalism is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>triumph.</v>

378
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.133
<v Speaker 1>It will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it will become the New </v>

379
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Paradigm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

380
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.940
<v Speaker 1>in the 21st century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

381
00:21:39.130 --> 00:21:39.963
<v Speaker 1>not because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more idealistic or it sounds </v>

382
00:21:43.211 --> 00:21:44.044
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll become the dominant paradigm </v>

383
00:21:45.101 --> 00:21:45.934
<v Speaker 1>simply because it will win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will win in the marketplace and </v>

384
00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.600
<v Speaker 1>nothing succeeds in capitalism more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>success itself.</v>

385
00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.900
<v Speaker 1>So good ideas that work spread and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive nature of the marketplace is</v>

386
00:22:04.391 --> 00:22:05.224
<v Speaker 1>going to lead to these competitions </v>
<v Speaker 1>between conscious businesses and less </v>

387
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:10.450
<v Speaker 1>conscious businesses and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

388
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.990
<v Speaker 1>the conscious businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all other things being equal,</v>

389
00:22:12.991 --> 00:22:14.650
<v Speaker 1>we're going to win most of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>battles.</v>

390
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And so fairly quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning when I say quickly,</v>

391
00:22:18.401 --> 00:22:20.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean 25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

392
00:22:20.501 --> 00:22:21.334
<v Speaker 1>35 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see more and more and </v>

393
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:23.974
<v Speaker 1>more conscious businesses and we will </v>
<v Speaker 1>make this shift towards conscious </v>

394
00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:27.580
<v Speaker 1>capitalistic society.</v>

395
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.713
<v Speaker 1>My first instinct is to tell you that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do think retail is one of the first </v>

396
00:22:37.091 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 1>areas to shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

397
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.340
<v Speaker 1>possibly because they are dealing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their customers,</v>

398
00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.293
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day basis and they've got </v>

399
00:22:45.851 --> 00:22:50.710
<v Speaker 1>their more labor intensive as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to hire and employ more people</v>

400
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:52.270
<v Speaker 1>like whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>market employees,</v>

401
00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:53.680
<v Speaker 1>57,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

402
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 1>So we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

403
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.250
<v Speaker 1>and we have millions of customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense,</v>

404
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:01.263
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're in a extremely competitive </v>

405
00:23:02.741 --> 00:23:04.150
<v Speaker 1>marketplace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food retailing,</v>

406
00:23:04.151 --> 00:23:04.984
<v Speaker 1>and we don't have any patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have any in the government's </v>

407
00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:10.690
<v Speaker 1>not protecting a US in some way from </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

408
00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:11.524
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we have formidably competitors are </v>

409
00:23:13.481 --> 00:23:14.830
<v Speaker 1>much larger than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than us.</v>

410
00:23:14.831 --> 00:23:17.200
<v Speaker 1>So like Walmart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kroger,</v>

411
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.060
<v Speaker 1>safe way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies like that.</v>

412
00:23:19.061 --> 00:23:20.740
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

413
00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.240
<v Speaker 1>retail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

414
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:23.343
<v Speaker 1>is one of the first areas to shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And many of the conscious businesses </v>

415
00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:29.290
<v Speaker 1>that I know tend to be either retailers </v>
<v Speaker 1>or service businesses,</v>

416
00:23:29.291 --> 00:23:30.124
<v Speaker 1>companies like the container store or </v>
<v Speaker 1>costco or starbucks or the southwest </v>

417
00:23:35.801 --> 00:23:36.700
<v Speaker 1>airlines.</v>

418
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

419
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:39.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>

420
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

421
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:42.063
<v Speaker 1>are businesses that trader Joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are businesses that our retailers </v>

422
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:49.370
<v Speaker 1>we're service oriented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do think maybe the conscious,</v>

423
00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:52.640
<v Speaker 1>a conscious business revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious capitalism,</v>

424
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Ra revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see that take hold in a more large</v>

425
00:23:57.051 --> 00:24:00.020
<v Speaker 1>scale way in the retail and service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

426
00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:02.810
<v Speaker 1>I can predict also possibly what will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>last.</v>

427
00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I predict possibly Wall Street will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>

428
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the,</v>

429
00:24:07.450 --> 00:24:10.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure financial part of our economy,</v>

430
00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:16.180
<v Speaker 1>which to a greater extent it steak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have as much of a stakeholder</v>

431
00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.280
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does tend to be dominated by the,</v>

432
00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:20.690
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

433
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:21.823
<v Speaker 1>profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>profit maximization model and </v>

434
00:24:25.251 --> 00:24:26.084
<v Speaker 1>shareholder return model to a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree than other segments of our </v>

435
00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:33.800
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I suspect retail and services will be</v>

436
00:24:33.801 --> 00:24:36.680
<v Speaker 1>first and the financial sector will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>last.</v>

437
00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.060
<v Speaker 1>I do think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

438
00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.530
<v Speaker 1>the economy is going to continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve towards a more service.</v>

439
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:51.733
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human beings are doing more things </v>

440
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:56.630
<v Speaker 1>to serve one another in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

441
00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

442
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.440
<v Speaker 1>but the new things or if you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole technology area,</v>

443
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.900
<v Speaker 1>so much of that didn't even exist 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago.</v>

444
00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.310
<v Speaker 1>There was no facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no google,</v>

445
00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:14.710
<v Speaker 1>there was no ipods or no i-phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

446
00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.780
<v Speaker 1>really blackberries didn't even exist 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

447
00:25:17.781 --> 00:25:18.614
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many different things change so </v>

448
00:25:20.841 --> 00:25:22.560
<v Speaker 1>rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

449
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.330
<v Speaker 1>and new industries and whole industries </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be created fairly,</v>

450
00:25:26.331 --> 00:25:28.250
<v Speaker 1>fairly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

451
00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:29.773
<v Speaker 1>I think it's safe to say that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see greater innovations in </v>

452
00:25:32.841 --> 00:25:33.674
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That here's an area that needs radical </v>

453
00:25:37.101 --> 00:25:39.980
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we don't allow competition,</v>

454
00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.340
<v Speaker 1>we don't allow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't unleashed human creativity.</v>

455
00:25:43.341 --> 00:25:44.174
<v Speaker 1>So education potentially if we could and</v>
<v Speaker 1>monopolize education and truly allow </v>

456
00:25:49.371 --> 00:25:52.450
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs to get going on that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

457
00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.500
<v Speaker 1>that can't think of hardly healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 1>and education are the two most regulated</v>

458
00:25:58.371 --> 00:26:00.320
<v Speaker 1>areas in our society.</v>

459
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:04.700
<v Speaker 1>And they're also the ones that are most </v>
<v Speaker 1>or least satisfactory to people.</v>

460
00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.940
<v Speaker 1>Those are areas that we need to to d </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopolize and allow more competition to</v>

461
00:26:10.821 --> 00:26:13.400
<v Speaker 1>occur.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are two huge areas,</v>

462
00:26:13.401 --> 00:26:15.730
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

463
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.720
<v Speaker 1>and healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both service areas.</v>

464
00:26:17.721 --> 00:26:22.721
<v Speaker 1>So those are growth industries also </v>
<v Speaker 1>think all types of leisure travel is a,</v>

465
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:28.160
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a society becomes more fluent.</v>

466
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's desire to travel a increases and to</v>

467
00:26:31.491 --> 00:26:34.400
<v Speaker 1>explore that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The younger generation today,</v>

468
00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.680
<v Speaker 1>people that are in their twenties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

469
00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.070
<v Speaker 1>they have traveled so much more than my </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation had.</v>

470
00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean for me a big deal when I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my twenties and going down Mexico and </v>

471
00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.190

<v Speaker 1>maybe you get up to Canada,</v>

472
00:26:47.191 --> 00:26:50.280
<v Speaker 1>but today people haven't just gone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

473
00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've gone all over the world by </v>

474
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:55.320
<v Speaker 1>the time they're 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're young and well educated,</v>

475
00:26:55.321 --> 00:26:56.154
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've world travel is going to be </v>

476
00:26:57.781 --> 00:26:59.610

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

477
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.210

<v Speaker 1>globalization continues to occur,</v>

478
00:27:03.211 --> 00:27:04.500
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue to explore.</v>

479
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Also think I'm a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge possibilities and entertainment.</v>

480
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:11.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look how much entertainment has evolved </v>

481
00:27:12.991 --> 00:27:14.790
<v Speaker 1>and shifted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>figure out ways to serve ourselves </v>

496
00:27:58.921 --> 00:28:00.210
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

<v Speaker 1>something like [inaudible] I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist in any kind of scale 25 years ago.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but hardly anybody did it.</v>

501
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.273

<v Speaker 1>or activities that are also leading to </v>

502
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:17.034
<v Speaker 1>greater human flourishing through </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping humans to be a more fit and </v>
