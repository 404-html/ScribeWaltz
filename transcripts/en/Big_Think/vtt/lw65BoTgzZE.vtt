00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're gonna lose a lot,</v>

2
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>almost whatever we do because there's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many species right now that are on the</v>

3
00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>brink of extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the break,</v>

4
00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>species and flowering plants.</v>

5
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:27.940
<v Speaker 1>We should what you're known for one</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual</v>

6
00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and there are a bird species for</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

7
00:00:33.521 --> 00:00:38.521
<v Speaker 1>that are down to a few dozen individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to rhinoceros species two out of</v>

8
00:00:39.551 --> 00:00:44.551
<v Speaker 1>the five that existed on the planet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are 300 individual or fewer left.</v>

9
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of those we're going to lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably no matter what we do,</v>

10
00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>especially those which we don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>know yet exist.</v>

11
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 1>And we may never know they ever existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they go extinct before we can learn</v>

12
00:01:01.211 --> 00:01:06.211
<v Speaker 1>enough about the world's biodiversity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we plan our use of the</v>

13
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>environment in the future intelligently</v>
<v Speaker 1>and drive towards the goal of</v>

14
00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 1>sustainable development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a development in producers,</v>

15
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 1>increasing quality of life and security</v>
<v Speaker 1>for people,</v>

16
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but reduces the amount of materials and</v>

17
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:34.441
<v Speaker 1>energy that we're using up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we intelligently plan a,</v>

18
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>the establishment of reserves where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>we get the maximum protection for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>largest number of species.</v>

20
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The conservation organizations like</v>

21
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>conservation international,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we have served on the board,</v>

22
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.570
<v Speaker 1>are devoted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

23
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>then I think we'll save a majority of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the remaining pictures.</v>
