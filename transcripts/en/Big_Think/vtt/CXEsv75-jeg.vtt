1
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>There are several questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the essential questions that leaders and</v>

2
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>managers should ask themselves when they</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at how they want kpis to have an</v>

3
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>impact and influence on their</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>The most important one is obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's most important to the</v>

5
00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>organization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where is value really created?</v>

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Where is value really created for us</v>
<v Speaker 1>internally and for our clients,</v>

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.320
<v Speaker 1>for our customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for our users,</v>

8
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.970
<v Speaker 1>whether they be business or consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.750
<v Speaker 1>How do we want to measure that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of performance leads to those</v>

10
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:50.781
<v Speaker 1>kinds of outcomes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The big challenge,</v>

11
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 1>the difficult challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge that my colleagues and I</v>

12
00:00:55.591 --> 00:01:00.591
<v Speaker 1>and my clients and I and my students and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I debate and argue the most is when our</v>

13
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:06.681
<v Speaker 1>kpis means and when our kpis ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we want to have key</v>

14
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>performance because that's what</v>
<v Speaker 1>excellent means.</v>

15
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>We're always greeting customers with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>smile.</v>

16
00:01:15.511 --> 00:01:17.970
<v Speaker 1>We're always trying to provide the</v>
<v Speaker 1>easiest,</v>

17
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>most convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best possible user experience.</v>

18
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>There are other times when the outcome</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really what matters the most,</v>

19
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 1>which is we get a profit on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get a sale for this,</v>

20
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>what our means and ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the KPI's link,</v>

21
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>here's how we've dramatically increased</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sales.</v>

22
00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>That's fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sales Sales Kpi,</v>

23
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 1>we've outperformed our sales KPI and</v>
<v Speaker 1>expectation.</v>

24
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three weeks later,</v>

25
00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>three months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the returns for what we've sold are</v>

26
00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:01.881
<v Speaker 1>larger than ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The customer satisfaction scores or the</v>

27
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 1>net promoter scores have dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>precipitously.</v>

28
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to manage trade offs between</v>

29
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Kpis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The leadership challenge,</v>

30
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.670
<v Speaker 1>the management challenge is not just how</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we do a better job of identifying,</v>

31
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>cultivating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deploying kpis.</v>

32
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>It's how do we identify and manage the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions and sometimes conflicts between</v>

33
00:02:30.991 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

34
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 1>that's why this is such a fun subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes there can be changes</v>

35
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.640
<v Speaker 1>where the kpis converge or a new KPI</v>
<v Speaker 1>emerges from your observation of means</v>

36
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.044
<v Speaker 1>and ends.</v>

37
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>Many stories and anecdotes that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>told about kpis that really positively</v>

38
00:02:55.561 --> 00:03:00.561
<v Speaker 1>and constructively transform how an</v>
<v Speaker 1>organization behaves and they're also</v>

39
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but obviously examples of what one might</v>

40
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:09.001
<v Speaker 1>call pathological kpis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kpis that make sense in the moment,</v>

41
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>but when you review their ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact internally and externally,</v>

42
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad.</v>

43
00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>A classic example from 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>

44
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>back when we had call centers instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact centers was time spent on calls</v>

45
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that many call centers were compensated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key performance indicator was how do</v>

46
00:03:35.471 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>we keep the call down to two minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three minutes,</v>

47
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>five minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so throughput calls per hour,</v>

48
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>calls per day where the d a dominant Kpi</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what productivity was</v>

49
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.030
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you end up with?</v>

50
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>High throughput,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy customers.</v>

51
00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Even oftentimes if their situation was</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolved because the feedback was I felt</v>

52
00:04:02.831 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>rushed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt they were interrupting a lot.</v>

53
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad ux.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a bad customer experience.</v>

54
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>There was also emerging at that time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notion of first touch,</v>

55
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.420
<v Speaker 1>first call resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we get things resolved at that</v>

56
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:23.090
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>the first part without making the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>called back or without your calling the</v>

58
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

59
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>if I may digress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know what really transformed that</v>

60
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:36.151
<v Speaker 1>KPI was chat programs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what people could do was they</v>

61
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:37.420
<v Speaker 1>could do a chat to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

62
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:40.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm having this kind of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should I do with this person?</v>

63
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.030
<v Speaker 1>And just look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were able to use their</v>

64
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:48.031
<v Speaker 1>colleagues or a database or a Wiki to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get an answer to do first call</v>

65
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>resolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this ties into the notion of not just</v>

66
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:55.420
<v Speaker 1>a dominant KPI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do we get a productive tension</v>

67
00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>between kpis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is time spent on call,</v>

68
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.830
<v Speaker 1>the second is effective resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the third is customer satisfied.</v>

69
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get them all</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

70
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be a sweet spot</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

71
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>And in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triangulating those kpis to create a</v>

72
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:22.201
<v Speaker 1>sweet spot was transformative for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of call centers that subsequently became</v>

73
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>contact centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So remember,</v>

74
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:29.730
<v Speaker 1>if you pick the wrong dominant KPI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may end up with perverse outcomes</v>

75
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>because you are incenting perverse</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviors.</v>

76
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>If you'll forgive me for making a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>acronym pun,</v>

77
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways you shock people into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this recognition is that you say Kpi</v>

78
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:50.890
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just stand for key performance</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicator.</v>

79
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>It stands for key performance incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So make sure you're recognizing and</v>

80
00:05:57.801 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>rewarding the right things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not things that can lead to perverse or</v>

81
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.430
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive outcomes.</v>
