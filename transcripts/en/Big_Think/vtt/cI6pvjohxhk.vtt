00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>The most prominent conspiracy theory was</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from a pan down insurance,</v>

2
00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.110
<v Speaker 1>a insurance company investigation that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was ran by a guy called</v>

3
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.800
<v Speaker 1>who pretend to be an officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a code named abner that wrote the book</v>

4
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>vengeance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the basis for the Spielberg</v>

5
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.800
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Munich Olympic massacre.</v>

6
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Everything that he wrote is false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw and I had numerous meetings and</v>

7
00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:43.241
<v Speaker 1>conversations with him every time that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we reached a point where he was supposed</v>

8
00:00:43.761 --> 00:00:48.761
<v Speaker 1>to give me the smoking gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one conclusive evidence that proves a</v>

9
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it was Iran sending the Pfl G,</v>

10
00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm a organization to take revenge for</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking off the Uranian Airbus aircraft</v>

11
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:08.411
<v Speaker 1>by the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S Vincent's a ship by Mr and that the</v>

12
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:14.561
<v Speaker 1>CIA had a unit called Korea that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in taking out a Pan Am 103 for</v>

13
00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 1>their reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time that we reach that smoking</v>

14
00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:21.320
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

15
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

16
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>it's in a safe in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will just about.</v>

17
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give it to you tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will take me few more hours.</v>

18
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>I never saw any real conclusive evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that connects Iran to this case or this</v>

19
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>connected Libyans and at the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

20
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>while my Kadafi paid compensations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I don't know from his point of view</v>

21
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.550
<v Speaker 1>why I gave the person involved to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>

22
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 1>why would he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would he pay con conference con?</v>

23
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Why would he pay any money</v>
<v Speaker 1>for something that he didn't do?</v>

24
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.400
<v Speaker 1>A very positive example and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative example to negotiating on</v>

25
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>nuclear issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The very positive as Libya,</v>

26
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>the mic and CIA got involved with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>son of Kadafi who convinced this father,</v>

27
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 1>who used to be considered the most crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all Middle East leaders to compromise</v>

28
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.290
<v Speaker 1>and to give up everything for western</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

29
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.390
<v Speaker 1>This is very positive and they complied</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all promises that they gave and</v>

30
00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.310
<v Speaker 1>disassembled the whole of their nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 1>project.</v>

31
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>The negative example with be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

32
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:45.311
<v Speaker 1>North Korea that sign a sort of a deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with President Clinton just to stall</v>

33
00:02:45.681 --> 00:02:50.450
<v Speaker 1>time and have more nuclear advancement</v>
<v Speaker 1>that lead them to a bomb.</v>

34
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesson would be I think that the US</v>

35
00:02:54.771 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>should deal or should negotiate with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran if the Iranians are willing to</v>

36
00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>negotiate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US cannot afford to refused</v>

37
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:07.951
<v Speaker 1>negotiation with what I see as the worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>security challenge the US is facing.</v>

38
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And this is Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Iranians are willing to negotiate,</v>

39
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Speaker 1>the US should deal with them without</v>
<v Speaker 1>preconditions.</v>

40
00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.450
<v Speaker 1>I know that general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Senator John Mccain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he preaches for preconditions.</v>

42
00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't support this view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the US should go to the</v>

43
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.760
<v Speaker 1>negotiation table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just making sure that Iran is not</v>

44
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:31.160
<v Speaker 1>just doing it as he did to your to gain</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

45
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>If Iran is willing to negotiate the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>stopping the enrichment of uranium</v>
<v Speaker 1>cutting relations with Iraqian Afghany,</v>

47
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.190
<v Speaker 1>insurgencies stopping a to Hamas</v>

48
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.570
<v Speaker 1>stopping promoting his butler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

50
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that this would be great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be a major solution and a</v>

51
00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:56.540
<v Speaker 1>peaceful solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe the last chance before,</v>

52
00:03:56.541 --> 00:04:01.541
<v Speaker 1>before a striking Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would gloomily globally a suspect that</v>

53
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>the Iranians will not give all this</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they deem is a very interesting,</v>

54
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.910
<v Speaker 1>very important interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of the day,</v>

55
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>a much more harsh action would be taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
