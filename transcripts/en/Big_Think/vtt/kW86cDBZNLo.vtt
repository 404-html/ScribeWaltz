1
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way I think about attention is</v>

2
00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:10.110
<v Speaker 1>really as a problem of routing routing</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals,</v>

3
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>so actually we know a lot about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>signals come in through your sensory</v>

4
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>apparatus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through your ears and your eyes.</v>

5
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>We know an awful lot about how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>retina works,</v>

6
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 1>how the Cochlea Works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we understand how the signals travel up</v>

7
00:00:27.211 --> 00:00:30.720
<v Speaker 1>and eventually they percolate up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cortex.</v>

8
00:00:30.721 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>In the case of sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they percolate up to the auditory cortex</v>

9
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 1>and we know a lot about a fair amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how they look once they get there</v>

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>and after that we kind of lose track of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and we can't really pick up the</v>

11
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>signal until we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're coming out the other end.</v>

12
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>We know a lot about movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We understand an awful lot about what</v>

13
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>happens when a nerve impulse gets to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>muscle and how muscles contract.</v>

14
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:55.980
<v Speaker 1>That's been pretty well understood for</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years or something.</v>

15
00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.510
<v Speaker 1>You're more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where we really lose track of them is</v>

16
00:01:00.511 --> 00:01:05.511
<v Speaker 1>when they enter into the early parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sensory cortex and when there we</v>

17
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>pick them up again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of on the on the other side,</v>

18
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.060
<v Speaker 1>and so attention is one of the ways in</v>
<v Speaker 1>which signals can find their destination</v>

19
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>if you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So think about it in terms of a really</v>

20
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>specific a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that I asked you to raise your</v>

21
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I say go,</v>

22
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I say go you raise your right hand,</v>

23
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>go raise your right hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's change it.</v>

24
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>And I say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go raise your left hand,</v>

25
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>go raise your left hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So somehow the same signal coming in</v>

26
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:42.030
<v Speaker 1>through your ear is producing different</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity at the other end,</v>

27
00:01:42.031 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>somehow the signal on the sensory side</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to be routed to either the muscles</v>

28
00:01:46.681 --> 00:01:48.930
<v Speaker 1>of your right hand or the muscles of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your left hand.</v>

29
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention is a special case of that kind</v>

30
00:01:52.951 --> 00:01:57.951
<v Speaker 1>of general routing problem at the brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>faces all the time because when you</v>

31
00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:03.741
<v Speaker 1>attend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say your a sounds rather than your</v>

32
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:09.411
<v Speaker 1>visual input or when you attend to one</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular auditory input out of many,</v>

33
00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing is you're selecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>some subset of the inputs in this case,</v>

34
00:02:15.451 --> 00:02:20.280
<v Speaker 1>coming in to your ears and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>subjecting them to further processing</v>

35
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're taking those signals and routing</v>

36
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>them downstream and doing stuff with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

37
00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:30.390
<v Speaker 1>How that routing happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the aspect of attention that my</v>

38
00:02:30.391 --> 00:02:31.890
<v Speaker 1>lab focuses on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

39
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.910
<v Speaker 1>so the basic setup for the problem that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in is this.</v>

40
00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:39.780
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you're at a cocktail party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a bunch of conversations going</v>

41
00:02:39.781 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>on and you're talking to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's all this distracting stuff</v>

42
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The side lines.</v>

43
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>You can make a choice.</v>

44
00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>You can either focus on the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to and ignore the rest.</v>

45
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Or as often happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that the conversation that</v>

46
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:56.180
<v Speaker 1>you're engaged in is not as interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh Huh.</v>

47
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh Huh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

48
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

49
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And you start focusing in on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation on the right,</v>

50
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>your ability to focus in on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation while ignoring that</v>

51
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is sort of the challenge.</v>

52
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Understanding how we do that is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge of,</v>

53
00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 1>of my research and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that problem actually has two separate</v>

54
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>aspects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's one aspect of that problem</v>

55
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>that is really a problem of computation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

56
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a problem that is a challenge to</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically any computer,</v>

57
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>namely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 1>we have a whole bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds and from a bunch of different</v>

59
00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:36.511
<v Speaker 1>sources and they're super imposed at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of the ears and somehow they're,</v>

60
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>they're added together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to us it's typically pretty</v>

61
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>effortless for us to separate out those</v>
<v Speaker 1>different threads of the conversation.</v>

62
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>But actually that's surprisingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult tasks.</v>

63
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So a computers maybe 10 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>

64
00:03:53.801 --> 00:03:58.801
<v Speaker 1>we're getting pretty good at doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech recognition and in,</v>

65
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>in a controlled situations and quiet</v>
<v Speaker 1>rooms.</v>

66
00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Computers were actually pretty good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing even a random speakers,</v>

67
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>but when people actually start deploying</v>
<v Speaker 1>these in real world settings where</v>

68
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>there's traffic noise and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the computer algorithms broke down</v>

69
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.890
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was sort of surprising at first</v>

70
00:04:20.891 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>because that's the aspect that we as</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans seem to have a not much trouble</v>

71
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>with at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

72
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:28.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.740
<v Speaker 1>ability to take apart the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>components of an auditory scene,</v>

74
00:04:32.741 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>that's what we've evolved for hundreds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of millions of years to do really well.</v>

75
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one aspect of attention.</v>

76
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>There's almost this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aspect of it that happens before we're</v>

78
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>even aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the auditory scene is broken down</v>

79
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>into the components.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other aspect,</v>

80
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>the one that we're sort of more</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciously aware of is the one where</v>

82
00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>out of the many components of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>

83
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 1>we have this auditory seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We select one and that's the one we</v>

84
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>focus in on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this hypothetical cocktail party,</v>

86
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the choice of focusing on either</v>

87
00:05:11.951 --> 00:05:15.160
<v Speaker 1>the conversation we're engaged in or</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one or that one.</v>
