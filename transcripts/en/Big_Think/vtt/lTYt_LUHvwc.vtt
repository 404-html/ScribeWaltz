1
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>We have a responsibility as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional,</v>

2
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 2>the timeline of the professional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's happening in the profession,</v>

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 2>who has made a contribution and learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from those things to free yourself to</v>

4
00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:26.261
<v Speaker 2>become your own voice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was building this house in North</v>

5
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were making the documentary of,</v>

6
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.160
<v Speaker 2>and I work with Peter Shelton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my partner and my dear friend from</v>

7
00:00:34.161 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 2>college read Morrison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized there's the building went up.</v>

8
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>I could kind of see the</v>
<v Speaker 2>intellectual collage of who I was as</v>

9
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 2>pieces of the building stood at various</v>
<v Speaker 2>stages.</v>

10
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 2>I could feel the ghost of Loucon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I looked at the poured concrete,</v>

11
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 2>when I saw some of the glass details,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I kept thinking of the architects</v>

12
00:00:59.961 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 2>collaborative in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I looked at</v>

13
00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:09.490
<v Speaker 2>some of the woodworking on the cladding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought of Ed Barnes or Cert,</v>

14
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>and then the way the stair was</v>
<v Speaker 2>conceived,</v>

15
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 2>I thought of court was the a</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started to realize that pieces of</v>

16
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:24.980
<v Speaker 2>who we are are often pieces of who we've</v>
<v Speaker 2>looked and studied,</v>

17
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 2>but it's our responsibility to then</v>
<v Speaker 2>become ourselves.</v>

18
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 2>So how do you take that where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost dissect your own psyche and the</v>

19
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>layers of building is such an</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting tapestry of those pieces of</v>

20
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:45.401
<v Speaker 2>who you are and then hopefully when they</v>
<v Speaker 2>come together they become you,</v>

21
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 2>but you owe to who you've become.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I realized when that building</v>

22
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 2>was done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I love the archeology of great</v>

23
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.340
<v Speaker 2>people in my profession,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning whether it's their drawings,</v>

24
00:02:01.341 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 2>their furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their lighting</v>

25
00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.280
<v Speaker 2>that kind of designed democracy emerged,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is such an American idea</v>

26
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 2>that we embrace many cultures and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrate them and we celebrate ideas.</v>

27
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 2>So the building was a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>international amalgam of people and</v>

28
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 2>things that as Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're very open to and that I had</v>

29
00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 2>actually collected the archeology of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>

30
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 2>And as those things occupied the</v>
<v Speaker 2>building,</v>

31
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>I realized that there archeology</v>
<v Speaker 2>informed the building that they inhabit.</v>
