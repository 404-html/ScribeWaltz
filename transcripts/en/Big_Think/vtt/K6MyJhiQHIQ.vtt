1
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:02.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 2>Working in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very conscious that there are 53</v>

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 2>countries and that they are moving at</v>
<v Speaker 2>different speeds.</v>

4
00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.880
<v Speaker 2>And the two also have important Pan</v>
<v Speaker 2>African and regional African</v>

5
00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 2>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.530
<v Speaker 2>there was a reform of the African Union</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it has a commission,</v>

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.720
<v Speaker 2>like the commission of the European</v>
<v Speaker 2>Union.</v>

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.480
<v Speaker 2>Half the members of that commission are</v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

9
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 2>So there's a big commitment to gender in</v>
<v Speaker 2>m a lot of issues in many of the</v>

10
00:00:33.401 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

11
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 2>there is a real sense that things are</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving forward.</v>

12
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 2>And there was a recent Pew opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 2>sampling taken and most of the African</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries sampled,</v>

14
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 2>really felt there's a lot of room for</v>
<v Speaker 2>improvement,</v>

15
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 2>but we're on the right road commitment</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Millennium Goals,</v>

16
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 2>better governments tackling corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's a tendency sometimes</v>

17
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 2>to sort of write off Africa and a sweep</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being a basket case or something far</v>

18
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're actually very interesting</v>

19
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 2>and very progressive things happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the countries in Africa.</v>
