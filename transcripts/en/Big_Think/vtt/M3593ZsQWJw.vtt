WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:02.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 2>when we bought discovery it was in</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible shape</v>

3
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.750
<v Speaker 2>and the first priority was to turn the</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine around and three,</v>

4
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 2>capture the sense of excitement and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>had say 10 and even 20 years ago and the</v>

5
00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:31.881
<v Speaker 2>web was there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we let it lie fallow for a bit what</v>

6
00:00:32.071 --> 00:00:35.370
<v Speaker 2>we fixed the magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is important because I wanted the</v>

7
00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 2>magazine to have its own personality and</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy DNA first.</v>

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 2>Then I wanted the web to capture that</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I wanted it to grow into its own,</v>

9
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 2>its own personality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was far more immediate news.</v>

10
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>science news happens fast.</v>

11
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's regulatory when it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most of all,</v>

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 2>I thought the people who had made a</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery will be most gushing to talk</v>

13
00:01:00.031 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 2>about it right at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I wanted us to involve a lot more,</v>

14
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists and I took the va with.</v>

15
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 2>You may have read this in some of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>precedents.</v>

16
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm that scientists are rockstars in</v>
<v Speaker 2>many ways.</v>

17
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 2>They're rock stars near community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's certainly rock stars in their</v>

18
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 2>own heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you from personal</v>

19
00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

20
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 2>they have a lot to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

21
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 2>whenever they say it is brilliant and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating,</v>

22
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is where sometimes the</v>
<v Speaker 2>analogy diverge just because not that</v>

23
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 2>many rock stars of that fascinating when</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

24
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opened up,</v>

25
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 2>but every scientist is and every</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientist has a great sense of humor.</v>

26
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's something I,</v>

27
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried to make sure we had some human</v>

28
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.590
<v Speaker 2>that website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a strategy with the web was same as</v>

29
00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 2>it'll be with any magazine I run is be</v>
<v Speaker 2>the personality of the core product,</v>

30
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 2>but have your own personality develop</v>
<v Speaker 2>your own life because people consume the</v>

31
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 2>internet differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They consume print.</v>

32
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean the same person at the same time</v>
<v Speaker 2>will shift from one to another but</v>

33
00:01:56.581 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 2>consume it in different ways in the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that a smart person will follow the</v>

34
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Financial Times and watch espn within</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same 20 minute span.</v>

35
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:04.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>W,</v>

36
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 2>w we do approach things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought that the media,</v>

37
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the web needed to be more immediate</v>

38
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>and more all encompassing and less of</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sort of archived articles.</v>

39
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 2>My first advice would have been that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>print magazine had gone off its rails</v>

40
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 2>and it failed to recognize</v>
<v Speaker 2>that times have changed.</v>

41
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:34.050
<v Speaker 2>It was no longer a novelty to see erotic</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures.</v>

42
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 2>I'm forget the fact that you can see</v>
<v Speaker 2>pictures in motion on the Internet.</v>

43
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 2>That wasn't it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the novelty and the need to see</v>

44
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 2>it and long gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My father started that magazine not long</v>

45
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.430
<v Speaker 2>after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hefner started exactly around the</v>

46
00:02:50.431 --> 00:02:54.540
<v Speaker 2>time the national geographic was</v>
<v Speaker 2>considered erotic because it printed</v>

47
00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 2>nude tribal women from Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you put it in context.</v>

48
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 2>That's where this stuff came from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It arrives in the post aids age of the</v>

49
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 2>mid eighties when it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just not new.</v>

50
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not new in a graphic way,</v>

51
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 2>something like maximum and loaded before</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

52
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 2>In England,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things were new.</v>

53
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 2>They were sexy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were sourcey.</v>

54
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 2>They were cheeky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they had editorial about the rest of</v>

55
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 2>men's interest as the dominant part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the magazine.</v>

56
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think penthouse needed to shift in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that direction.</v>

57
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 2>Maximum should never have come along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Panel should have usurped it.</v>

58
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm now the web nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's clearly an awful lot of people</v>

59
00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>going to see it run a system on the web</v>
<v Speaker 2>panels could have provided that I think,</v>

60
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think it needed to have gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>as hardcore as it did because I think it</v>

61
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.440
<v Speaker 2>sort of stained the overall company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would take the magazine very mild,</v>

62
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 2>a far more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more fun,</v>

63
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Allah maximum or a loaded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

64
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 2>and I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

65
00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.310
<v Speaker 2>taken the web to be whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost subscription,</v>

66
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 2>whatever people wanted a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

67
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:02.890
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're asking me to advise my dad,</v>

68
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 2>which I really desperately wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Post facto.</v>

69
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 2>It's not important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've had some of discussions.</v>

70
00:04:07.691 --> 00:04:09.520
<v Speaker 2>He agrees with someone that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with a lot of it.</v>

71
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my old man's a genius.</v>

72
00:04:11.441 --> 00:04:13.410
<v Speaker 2>So where he doesn't agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

73
00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder maybe,</v>

74
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.710
<v Speaker 2>maybe he's so something I did.</v>
