00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Hey there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Jason Guts and you're listening </v>

2
00:00:02.521 --> 00:00:04.680
<v Speaker 1>to think again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A big thank podcast</v>

3
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.913
<v Speaker 1>since 2008 I think has been bringing you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big ideas in little doses from some </v>

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>of the most creative thinkers around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the thing again,</v>

5
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we step outside of our comfort zone,</v>

6
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.830
<v Speaker 1>surprising our guests and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your host with unexpected clips from big</v>

7
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:25.851
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synergy you,</v>

8
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:26.684
<v Speaker 1>archives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we didn't necessarily come </v>

9
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.094
<v Speaker 1>here prepared to discuss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the fourth mix tape that I'm </v>

10
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:33.564
<v Speaker 1>doing of some of the highlights of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first year of the show and just time to </v>

11
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>reflect back and think about where we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>As you may have noticed if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>following the show,</v>

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.943
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of creative writers on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer myself and I think a lot </v>

14
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:49.404
<v Speaker 1>about the craft of writing and some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the guests have given our listeners </v>

15
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>advice that I find incredibly powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that stays with me all the time.</v>

16
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.953
<v Speaker 1>This episode is an attempt to round up </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those best moments from those </v>

17
00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>most powerful moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Advice about writer's block,</v>

18
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>how to work with the creative team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with success and failure and</v>

19
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:15.180
<v Speaker 1>how to deal with the psychology of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a writer.</v>

20
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>I hope that you'll find these moments as</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful as I do.</v>

21
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.633
<v Speaker 1>This first segment is from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with the acclaimed </v>

22
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.600
<v Speaker 1>playwright and screenwriter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir David Hare.</v>

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.943
<v Speaker 1>He really surprised me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a really interesting and </v>

24
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:35.961
<v Speaker 1>unexpected turn in the middle of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation that I found delightful and</v>

25
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:42.021
<v Speaker 1>the surprise quip is with Sheila keen </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the psychology of happened</v>

26
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:43.634
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

27
00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.593
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the neuroscience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that we're wired has a profound </v>

28
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:52.060
<v Speaker 2>effect on how we hear and respond to </v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback.</v>

29
00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.343
<v Speaker 2>We took a look at three variables that </v>
<v Speaker 2>are particularly important in terms of </v>

30
00:01:56.321 --> 00:01:58.990
<v Speaker 2>your reaction to feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is your baseline.</v>

31
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:00.063
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of how happy or unhappy are </v>
<v Speaker 2>you in the absence of other events in </v>

32
00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:03.964
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where's that level that you come back </v>

33
00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:06.424
<v Speaker 2>to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a scale of one to 10 some people </v>

34
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 2>just live their lives at nine right </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

35
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 2>just so unbelievably happy and cheerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>about everything.</v>

36
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.860
<v Speaker 2>This research comes from looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>lottery winners a year later.</v>

37
00:02:17.861 --> 00:02:21.070
<v Speaker 2>They're about as happy or unhappy as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were before they won the lottery.</v>

38
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.143
<v Speaker 2>And people who go to jail a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're about as happy or unhappy as </v>

39
00:02:25.061 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 2>before they went to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we look at the second variable,</v>

40
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:28.744
<v Speaker 2>which is swing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get positive or negative </v>

41
00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:31.264
<v Speaker 2>feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how far off your baseline does it knock </v>

42
00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:33.664
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same piece of feedback can be </v>

43
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 2>devastating for one person and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of annoying for another.</v>

44
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.803
<v Speaker 2>And then the third variable is how long </v>
<v Speaker 2>does it take you to come back to your </v>

45
00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 2>baseline?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long do you sustain positive feeling</v>

46
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 2>or how long does it take you to recover </v>
<v Speaker 2>from negative feeling so taken together.</v>

47
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:54.490
<v Speaker 2>That's where the big variation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity comes from.</v>

48
00:02:54.491 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 2>That some people are extremely sensitive</v>
<v Speaker 2>and other people are pretty insensitive.</v>

49
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or maybe I should</v>

50
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.520
<v Speaker 3>say even keel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I suppose if you're insensitive,</v>

51
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 3>you don't really care what I call you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it doesn't matter.</v>

52
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.940
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

53
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.540
<v Speaker 3>there are two principle things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yes.</v>

54
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.270
<v Speaker 3>About what she's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the feedback thing.</v>

55
00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.820
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I work in the collaborative arts.</v>

56
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.740
<v Speaker 3>I choose to be a playwright rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>a novelist or a poet.</v>

57
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.810
<v Speaker 3>And therefore for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>collaboration is absolutely essential.</v>

58
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.950
<v Speaker 3>If I'm working on a movie set or if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a rehearsal,</v>

59
00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.173
<v Speaker 3>then the whole day what I have written </v>
<v Speaker 3>is put under a degree of scrutiny and </v>

60
00:03:37.441 --> 00:03:38.274
<v Speaker 3>the actors in particular will say to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think that in the interest of the </v>

61
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:45.480
<v Speaker 3>general story,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have achieved this scene.</v>

62
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.430
<v Speaker 3>But let me tell you from my point of </v>
<v Speaker 3>view,</v>

63
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:51.630
<v Speaker 3>playing it as one person in this scene,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is not enough for me here.</v>

64
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I haven't got what I want or I can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>make sense of this change to which I can</v>

65
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:56.484
<v Speaker 3>only respond either by arguing or going </v>
<v Speaker 3>back and rewriting in order that the </v>

66
00:04:00.991 --> 00:04:01.824
<v Speaker 3>woman or man who's playing this </v>
<v Speaker 3>particular part will fit into the </v>

67
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Speaker 3>general picture and be able to play what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to play.</v>

68
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to put it under a scrutiny</v>

69
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.083
<v Speaker 3>that maybe you have overlooked in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>rush to follow the main narrative </v>

70
00:04:15.691 --> 00:04:18.810
<v Speaker 3>through.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so you're making adjustments all the</v>

71
00:04:18.811 --> 00:04:19.644
<v Speaker 3>time and you're accepting feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My experience is you can do that from a </v>

72
00:04:24.541 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 3>position of confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

73
00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 3>if you're confident about what the </v>
<v Speaker 3>general movement of the play or film is,</v>

74
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.273
<v Speaker 3>then there is no end to the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>input that you're open to because you </v>

75
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:36.774
<v Speaker 3>know that it will not be destructive </v>
<v Speaker 3>because you know that the resilience of </v>

76
00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.154
<v Speaker 3>the basic idea of what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll see you through and the thing </v>

77
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:50.841
<v Speaker 3>can't be damaged by minor adjustments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you're working with great actors,</v>

78
00:04:52.231 --> 00:04:55.380
<v Speaker 3>as I've spent my life working with some </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the greatest actors in the world,</v>

79
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.363
<v Speaker 3>you're just crazy not to listen to them </v>
<v Speaker 3>because what they're going to bring to </v>

80
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 3>it is going to be incredibly useful to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

81
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.460
<v Speaker 3>So from that point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 3>feedback is what I live on.</v>

82
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.770
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's my element and opinion.</v>

83
00:05:07.771 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>Remember is the element that any </v>
<v Speaker 3>creative person has to swim in.</v>

84
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

85
00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 3>a play doesn't exist until it's put </v>
<v Speaker 3>before an audience.</v>

86
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 3>And what the audience's opinion is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is what finishes that play off.</v>

87
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 3>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people want to become actors,</v>

88
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 3>young people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say to them,</v>

89
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.500
<v Speaker 3>you think you're going out there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to create other people,</v>

90
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.363
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be creative.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said half your job is going to be </v>

91
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 3>being judged.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How?</v>

92
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.873
<v Speaker 3>If your job is going to be out there and</v>
<v Speaker 3>sensing that the audience don't like </v>

93
00:05:40.711 --> 00:05:42.180
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you up for that?</v>

94
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:43.163
<v Speaker 3>Do you have the kind of temperament that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to be able to cope with the </v>

95
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:47.244
<v Speaker 3>dislike of large numbers of people?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going to fail in certain roles </v>

96
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.700
<v Speaker 3>and when you fail in certain roles in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of people,</v>

97
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be deeply embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shaming,</v>

98
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 3>humiliating and upsetting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you up for that?</v>

99
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.563
<v Speaker 3>Are you up for being judged?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what working in the </v>

100
00:06:02.391 --> 00:06:03.800
<v Speaker 3>collaborative arts involves.</v>

101
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.060
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let me ask you this because I understand</v>

102
00:06:07.061 --> 00:06:07.894
<v Speaker 4>from your memoir and just from the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you write that you're a sensitive </v>

103
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:12.274
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you are a very sensitive </v>

104
00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:14.764
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you were just starting out as a </v>

105
00:06:17.621 --> 00:06:18.700
<v Speaker 4>playwright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

106
00:06:18.701 --> 00:06:22.030
<v Speaker 4>if somebody had said that to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if somebody had come and said like,</v>

107
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.940
<v Speaker 4>do you have what it takes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is your skin thick enough?</v>

108
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 4>Would you have recoiled in horror and </v>
<v Speaker 4>crawled into a corner?</v>

109
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:30.540
<v Speaker 3>Completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

110
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 3>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not have chosen this job.</v>

111
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 3>I had known the degree of judgment that </v>
<v Speaker 3>it would involve.</v>

112
00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.333
<v Speaker 3>I have sat in audiences where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience is rejected the play and did </v>

113
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:44.450
<v Speaker 3>not want to hear what I wanted to say to</v>
<v Speaker 3>them and an extremely pay.</v>

114
00:06:44.451 --> 00:06:45.284
<v Speaker 3>It ripped my soul out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a night in Seattle where a film </v>

115
00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:48.794
<v Speaker 3>of mine was laughed off the screen in </v>
<v Speaker 3>1987 with a test audience to a preview </v>

116
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:54.434
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will never go back to the city of </v>

117
00:06:55.761 --> 00:06:57.450
<v Speaker 3>Seattle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but listen in the,</v>

118
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 3>in the time available to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's go back to her other point,</v>

119
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.500
<v Speaker 3>which is really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The happiness thing.</v>

120
00:07:03.501 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 3>You know that a year later the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>who is in jail,</v>

121
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.110
<v Speaker 3>is that the same level of happiness that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were before they were in Joe,</v>

122
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 3>I'm afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think this is true.</v>

123
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:12.583
<v Speaker 3>When you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a fantasy that you can change </v>

124
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 3>and that you can change your life and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you will achieve something and then when</v>

125
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.324
<v Speaker 3>you achieve that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will make a significant difference </v>

126
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 3>to your contentment index.</v>

127
00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.200
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're driven by fantasy.</v>

128
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.620
<v Speaker 3>When you're my age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there is no fantasy left.</v>

129
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:31.603
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am extremely happily married to a </v>

130
00:07:33.321 --> 00:07:36.050
<v Speaker 3>completely wonderful woman whom I </v>
<v Speaker 3>absolutely adore.</v>

131
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 3>My children I adore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>

132
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 3>my private life could not be any happier</v>
<v Speaker 3>than says there is no fantasy about my,</v>

133
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.413
<v Speaker 3>I do not go to sleep dreaming of meeting</v>
<v Speaker 3>some other woman who will transform my </v>

134
00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:49.154
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I adore the person that I am with and </v>

135
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 3>can imagine no better do you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nor will I do.</v>

136
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 3>I dream of writing a hit to play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've written hip place.</v>

137
00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.170
<v Speaker 3>I know what it feels like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've lived through it.</v>

138
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:02.570
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't significantly change your </v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

139
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:05.390
<v Speaker 3>You still have to start again and try </v>
<v Speaker 3>and write the next one.</v>

140
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.810
<v Speaker 3>So I feel that what she says about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sort of basic level of happiness you</v>

141
00:08:11.661 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 3>have in your life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't really change very much.</v>

142
00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.370
<v Speaker 1>One of my favorite conversations was </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Turkeys,</v>

143
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.233
<v Speaker 1>arguably in most celebrated living </v>
<v Speaker 1>novelist or Han Pamuk who won the Nobel </v>

144
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.363
<v Speaker 1>Prize for literature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here he's talking about something I've </v>

145
00:08:29.111 --> 00:08:32.020
<v Speaker 1>never really heard a writer discussed </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

146
00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.273
<v Speaker 1>which is the psychology of sitting down </v>
<v Speaker 1>every day to write and how a creative </v>

147
00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:39.424
<v Speaker 1>writer should manage that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find this to be incredible advice and </v>

148
00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:47.521
<v Speaker 1>the surprise clip is from psychologist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bessel Vanderkolk on trauma.</v>

149
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:51.843
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

150
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.860
<v Speaker 1>Psychiatry has always had a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to trauma.</v>

151
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.133
<v Speaker 6>It started who started off as a </v>
<v Speaker 6>discipline that looked at way back in </v>

152
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:01.644
<v Speaker 6>the late 18 hundreds people have very </v>
<v Speaker 6>bizarre reactions to trauma and so </v>

153
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:07.404
<v Speaker 6>there's that define hysteria,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sort of a some interested and then they </v>

154
00:09:11.311 --> 00:09:12.144
<v Speaker 6>put it Kubashen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's people no longer a large studies </v>

155
00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 6>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First World War breaks out a huge number</v>

156
00:09:18.511 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 6>of charm.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It has guys probably had lots to do with</v>

157
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:25.890
<v Speaker 6>the rise of Nazism.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then in 1947 the last book about war</v>

158
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:26.724
<v Speaker 6>charm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets published and there's nothing </v>

159
00:09:28.051 --> 00:09:32.370
<v Speaker 6>til 1982 or something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it takes a long time.</v>

160
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 6>Very psychiatry really doesn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>see trauma.</v>

161
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.713
<v Speaker 6>And in the current Dsm,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the people called the Bible of </v>

162
00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:41.933
<v Speaker 6>Psychiatry,</v>
<v Speaker 6>now we live with via diagnoses like </v>

163
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.370
<v Speaker 6>oppositional defiant disorder where </v>
<v Speaker 6>people don't ask,</v>

164
00:09:47.371 --> 00:09:48.204
<v Speaker 6>why did this kids come become defiance?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Bipolar disorder cause being mentally </v>

165
00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:53.963
<v Speaker 6>unstable going up and down at the </v>
<v Speaker 6>emotions and psychiatry does video what </v>

166
00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 6>to look at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what's behind there.</v>

167
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.580
<v Speaker 6>And as a consequence,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

168
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.423
<v Speaker 6>instead of looking at social conditions </v>
<v Speaker 6>as being at the origin of these </v>

169
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 6>disorders,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

170
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:07.853
<v Speaker 6>these kids get dragged up last year in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the u s kids got 18 point $1 billion </v>

171
00:10:13.411 --> 00:10:18.411
<v Speaker 6>versus secretary we drugs and these </v>
<v Speaker 6>drugs do calm people down.</v>

172
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Speaker 6>But they also work on the reward system </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the brain and decrease curiosity,</v>

173
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.490
<v Speaker 6>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 6>experimentation,</v>

174
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 6>engagement with people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the neglect of the issue of trauma in</v>

175
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:35.070
<v Speaker 6>the u s in particular is a very serious </v>
<v Speaker 6>public health issue.</v>

176
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.970
<v Speaker 7>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the biggest traumas of life is of course</v>

177
00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:42.863
<v Speaker 7>unrequited love.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My Normal Museum of innocence is </v>

178
00:10:46.411 --> 00:10:51.411
<v Speaker 7>extensively about the illusions of flow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I chronicle upper middle class,</v>

179
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.040
<v Speaker 7>Turkish men's obsession infatuation.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It is twice removed.</v>

180
00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:01.590
<v Speaker 7>Cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just like a trauma,</v>

181
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:05.310
<v Speaker 7>he can never get out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's ridiculed and made fun of,</v>

182
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 7>and a trauma means you are almost in a </v>
<v Speaker 7>war.</v>

183
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.220
<v Speaker 7>Your panic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't know what to do.</v>

184
00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.083
<v Speaker 7>You want to survive and you lack that </v>
<v Speaker 7>sense of logic that will control and </v>

185
00:11:17.341 --> 00:11:22.341
<v Speaker 7>heal you and perhaps paved the way out </v>
<v Speaker 7>of a traumatic situation.</v>

186
00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:28.200
<v Speaker 7>My understanding of a trauma is that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>want to get out of a situation,</v>

187
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.350
<v Speaker 7>but yet you're so much pressure that </v>
<v Speaker 7>your mind does not give you the clue out</v>

188
00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Speaker 7>of that kafkaesque way out of that </v>
<v Speaker 7>problem.</v>

189
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:39.353
<v Speaker 7>Lau is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps psychology psychiatrist should </v>

190
00:11:43.861 --> 00:11:47.340
<v Speaker 7>focus about Lao treated as that trauma.</v>

191
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.810
<v Speaker 7>I am against all this glorification,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sugar rising,</v>

192
00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:55.810
<v Speaker 7>put them on a pedestal.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The idea of love is a sweetie.</v>

193
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.240
<v Speaker 7>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's the sweetest thing,</v>

194
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 7>but it all comes with a bad package of </v>
<v Speaker 7>trauma,</v>

195
00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.760
<v Speaker 7>longing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>jealousy,</v>

196
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 7>anger,</v>
<v Speaker 7>miscommunication,</v>

197
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.120
<v Speaker 7>self obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 7>making you not see the whole picture.</v>

198
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 7>I'm a writer in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I want to be,</v>

199
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.643
<v Speaker 7>I'm a self conscious writer,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a writer who wants to know the effects </v>

200
00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.473
<v Speaker 7>of what he or she is doing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but also there is one side to me that </v>

201
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.873
<v Speaker 7>makes me survive.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps that is letting things go and </v>

202
00:12:28.241 --> 00:12:33.241
<v Speaker 7>just following the music that is </v>
<v Speaker 7>spontaneously coming inside of me.</v>

203
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.190
<v Speaker 7>Colors,</v>
<v Speaker 7>notes,</v>

204
00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:41.370
<v Speaker 7>verge that I'm possessed with Indian.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you write every day like me,</v>

205
00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.053
<v Speaker 7>sit on a table everyday traumas and </v>
<v Speaker 7>vanish perhaps because I know that life </v>

206
00:12:48.431 --> 00:12:51.340
<v Speaker 7>will be hard if I brought working in an </v>
<v Speaker 7>office.</v>

207
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 7>I choose the life of the solitary artist</v>
<v Speaker 7>writing every day,</v>

208
00:12:55.720 --> 00:13:00.720
<v Speaker 7>which avoids me from the pressures and </v>
<v Speaker 7>traumas of everyday life,</v>

209
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 7>but it's inimitable.</v>

210
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.170
<v Speaker 7>Life is in the end.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Daily life.</v>

211
00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.250
<v Speaker 7>I mean you are working hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You create a structure,</v>

212
00:13:08.251 --> 00:13:11.160
<v Speaker 7>you sit down every day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have a discipline,</v>

213
00:13:11.161 --> 00:13:15.180
<v Speaker 7>so somehow those structures are </v>
<v Speaker 7>sufficient.</v>

214
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:20.010
<v Speaker 7>Then you don't have to worry as much </v>
<v Speaker 7>about trying to control the rest.</v>

215
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.473
<v Speaker 7>I argued that a creative writer </v>
<v Speaker 7>professor should teach more about this </v>

216
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 7>than what should be the plot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What should be the,</v>

217
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:29.644
<v Speaker 7>because normative structural policies </v>
<v Speaker 7>about writing fiction is less important </v>

218
00:13:34.951 --> 00:13:37.740
<v Speaker 7>than teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The would be writer,</v>

219
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:41.310
<v Speaker 7>how to behave in life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how to take easy,</v>

220
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:46.550
<v Speaker 7>the regular systematic traumas,</v>
<v Speaker 7>writing blogs,</v>

221
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.370
<v Speaker 7>unhappiness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>money,</v>

222
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:51.030
<v Speaker 7>happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and depressive slowing down.</v>

223
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:56.480
<v Speaker 7>Being a writer is more about minding </v>
<v Speaker 7>your mental health,</v>

224
00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:58.373
<v Speaker 7>navigating according to your moods,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what section chapter of the book you </v>

225
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:07.920
<v Speaker 7>should write first because it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>appropriate to your moods now,</v>

226
00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.600
<v Speaker 7>what to do when you're blocked and how </v>
<v Speaker 7>to skip one chapter,</v>

227
00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:16.920
<v Speaker 7>skip one trauma,</v>
<v Speaker 7>skip one problem and continue.</v>

228
00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:22.000
<v Speaker 7>I understand that psychiatry address </v>
<v Speaker 7>traumas I taught,</v>

229
00:14:22.001 --> 00:14:22.834
<v Speaker 7>they were already doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I taught by the people we're going to </v>

230
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:28.840
<v Speaker 7>people and paying money and because they</v>
<v Speaker 7>had traumas.</v>

231
00:14:28.841 --> 00:14:29.674
<v Speaker 7>Now I learned they go for other reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I would go to a psychiatrist because I </v>

232
00:14:34.541 --> 00:14:35.374
<v Speaker 7>had a trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If I were to fall in love and never get </v>

233
00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:38.374
<v Speaker 7>out of Logan field that I'm hurt or if </v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm blocked by my writing and feel that </v>

234
00:14:42.251 --> 00:14:45.310
<v Speaker 7>I'm scared of something.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had traumas,</v>

235
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.250
<v Speaker 7>political representative traumas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In the past.</v>

236
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 7>In the end they gave me nightmares,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but the long run,</v>

237
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
<v Speaker 7>they just pass away.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If you are busy with something that </v>

238
00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:58.010
<v Speaker 7>makes you happy and it writing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>writing,</v>

239
00:14:58.011 --> 00:14:59.540
<v Speaker 7>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yes,</v>

240
00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.450
<v Speaker 7>gave me lots of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But in the long run,</v>

241
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:07.070
<v Speaker 7>I achievement of finishing something and</v>
<v Speaker 7>being like a child,</v>

242
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.460
<v Speaker 7>playing with his toys,</v>
<v Speaker 7>being busy with all the time,</v>

243
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 7>sols,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all the traumas of two worlds.</v>

244
00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:17.990
<v Speaker 7>I want to ask you like when you sit down</v>
<v Speaker 7>and your brain isn't working that day,</v>

245
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 7>does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whenever,</v>

246
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:22.220
<v Speaker 7>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then what do you do?</v>

247
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:26.420
<v Speaker 7>Hemingway has a nice advice.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He said at the end of today,</v>

248
00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:31.290
<v Speaker 7>if you know what you're going to write,</v>
<v Speaker 7>don't write the last sentence.</v>

249
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.400
<v Speaker 7>Keep it for the next morning.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So start with that sentence.</v>

250
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.870
<v Speaker 7>Once you write a beautiful sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that sentence will tell you what will be</v>

251
00:15:39.871 --> 00:15:41.700
<v Speaker 7>the next,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what will be the next,</v>

252
00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:45.090
<v Speaker 7>what will be the next?</v>
<v Speaker 7>When you're writing fiction,</v>

253
00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.373
<v Speaker 7>if you're in it eight sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have a magic feeling that it's </v>

254
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:54.030
<v Speaker 7>unfolding on his own.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You look a lot of your window.</v>

255
00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:55.043
<v Speaker 7>You look at say New York silhouette or </v>
<v Speaker 7>Bosphorus that I see from my window and </v>

256
00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:03.180
<v Speaker 7>my mind as if processed because I'm so </v>
<v Speaker 7>deeply in it.</v>

257
00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:05.330
<v Speaker 7>You continue like that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eh?</v>

258
00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:10.290
<v Speaker 7>I think if you work three hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you write three pages,</v>

259
00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.320
<v Speaker 7>if you work nine hours a day,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you write not nine pages but 18 pages.</v>

260
00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.243
<v Speaker 7>Once creativity goes up exponentially,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once you devote your life whole life to </v>

261
00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:26.160
<v Speaker 7>it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>even your sleep to it.</v>

262
00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:31.490
<v Speaker 7>The way to get out of our traumas in </v>
<v Speaker 7>fact is to invent a second world fictive</v>

263
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:36.210
<v Speaker 7>world or artistic world that will avoid </v>
<v Speaker 7>the trauma,</v>

264
00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.930
<v Speaker 7>but perhaps going to a psychiatrist who </v>
<v Speaker 7>understands you,</v>

265
00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.980
<v Speaker 7>maybe something,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but then maybe you can try it anymore.</v>

266
00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.320
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is the thing that my friends always</v>

267
00:16:47.321 --> 00:16:51.550
<v Speaker 7>tell me or and I see you're traumatized.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can give you this pill,</v>

268
00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:56.020
<v Speaker 7>but maybe tomorrow are feel happy and </v>
<v Speaker 7>that you cannot write again.</v>

269
00:16:56.290 --> 00:17:00.520
<v Speaker 7>Is that sent through contradiction in my</v>
<v Speaker 7>life?</v>

270
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:01.683
<v Speaker 7>Perhaps because I'm happy I cannot write</v>
<v Speaker 7>perhaps because I'm so unhappy I can </v>

271
00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:10.360
<v Speaker 7>write.</v>
<v Speaker 7>These are reasonable contradictions.</v>

272
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.320
<v Speaker 7>I think a writer's life has all of these</v>
<v Speaker 7>variations,</v>

273
00:17:14.650 --> 00:17:15.483
<v Speaker 7>but in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sailing with good Ville and bleeding in </v>

274
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:24.160
<v Speaker 7>the wind is the essential and you sell </v>
<v Speaker 7>on and on and on and on,</v>

275
00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:27.040
<v Speaker 7>and I'm writing fiction for the last 40 </v>
<v Speaker 7>years.</v>

276
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.083
<v Speaker 7>After 40 years of sailing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I have a sense that this wind will take </v>

277
00:17:32.561 --> 00:17:34.090
<v Speaker 7>me a twit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nice,</v>

278
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:35.560
<v Speaker 7>quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 7>good,</v>

279
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:36.663
<v Speaker 7>beautiful place.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I trust them in and sail and sail and </v>

280
00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:40.684
<v Speaker 7>right then right</v>

281
00:17:44.590 --> 00:17:48.610
<v Speaker 7>earlier this year,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I sat down with author James McBride,</v>

282
00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 7>who won the book award</v>

283
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 1>for the color of water to talk to him </v>
<v Speaker 1>about his memoir or biography </v>

284
00:17:55.021 --> 00:17:58.050
<v Speaker 1>investigation into the life of James </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown.</v>

285
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:59.543
<v Speaker 1>Here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brings up his recent experiences in </v>

286
00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:06.090
<v Speaker 1>what must have been one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting writers rooms ever.</v>

287
00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:10.230
<v Speaker 1>The surprise quip is from journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Duhigg,</v>

288
00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:14.040
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the power of habit talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>here about creative teams.</v>

289
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:20.443
<v Speaker 2>About five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Google started this interesting </v>

290
00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:23.563
<v Speaker 2>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to figure out how to build </v>

291
00:18:25.731 --> 00:18:26.564
<v Speaker 2>the perfect team and so what they did is</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started collecting huge amounts of </v>

292
00:18:29.601 --> 00:18:30.434
<v Speaker 2>data about all the teams within Google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The teams that at a glance look most </v>

293
00:18:34.911 --> 00:18:35.744
<v Speaker 2>productive oftentimes aren't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you can create this </v>

294
00:18:39.711 --> 00:18:42.470
<v Speaker 2>conversational turn taking equality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>voices,</v>

295
00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:43.483
<v Speaker 2>if you can convince people to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to each other by being sensitive </v>

296
00:18:46.011 --> 00:18:50.810
<v Speaker 2>to the nonverbal cues were giving off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you create psychological safety and</v>

297
00:18:50.811 --> 00:18:51.644
<v Speaker 2>psychological safety is the single </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest determinant in whether a team </v>

298
00:18:55.071 --> 00:18:57.470
<v Speaker 2>comes together or whether it falls </v>
<v Speaker 2>apart.</v>

299
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.633
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite examples of </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological safety and a team really </v>

300
00:19:01.011 --> 00:19:04.550
<v Speaker 2>come to coming together is the early </v>
<v Speaker 2>days of Saturday night live.</v>

301
00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:07.220
<v Speaker 2>So when you think about it on Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 2>night live,</v>

302
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:08.990
<v Speaker 2>never should have worked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

303
00:19:08.991 --> 00:19:13.430
<v Speaker 2>You have a bunch of Comedians who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of misanthropes to begin with,</v>

304
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.520
<v Speaker 2>and yet for some reason when Lauren </v>
<v Speaker 2>michaels put them in a room together,</v>

305
00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.700
<v Speaker 2>everyone was willing to kind of get </v>
<v Speaker 2>along.</v>

306
00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:21.950
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were willing to put aside their ego</v>

307
00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.800
<v Speaker 2>and create this amazing show together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only an amazing show,</v>

308
00:19:24.801 --> 00:19:28.700
<v Speaker 2>but a show that was put together under </v>
<v Speaker 2>these incredible time pressures,</v>

309
00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:29.534
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have a week to put together a live </v>

310
00:19:30.981 --> 00:19:31.814
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I talked to the early writers </v>

311
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:36.380
<v Speaker 2>and performers on Saturday night live </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I asked them why this happened.</v>

312
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.500
<v Speaker 2>All of them said the same thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Lorne michaels.</v>

313
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:43.790
<v Speaker 2>So Lauren Michaels has this very unique </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of running meetings.</v>

314
00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.343
<v Speaker 2>He sits down and the meeting starts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what he'll do is he'll make everyone go </v>

315
00:19:48.711 --> 00:19:49.544
<v Speaker 2>around the table and say something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if someone hasn't spoken up in a </v>

316
00:19:52.311 --> 00:19:53.144
<v Speaker 2>little while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lauren michaels will actually stop the </v>

317
00:19:54.351 --> 00:19:56.120
<v Speaker 2>meeting and he'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Susie,</v>

318
00:19:56.121 --> 00:19:56.954
<v Speaker 2>I noticed that you haven't chimed in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you thinking about right </v>

319
00:19:59.091 --> 00:20:01.670
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it all works out,</v>

320
00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:06.140
<v Speaker 2>but it's because he creates an </v>
<v Speaker 2>environment that feels safe,</v>

321
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.153
<v Speaker 2>where everyone feels like they can speak</v>
<v Speaker 2>up and they feel like everyone else is </v>

322
00:20:10.371 --> 00:20:11.204
<v Speaker 2>genuinely listening to them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sensitive to all the cues that </v>

323
00:20:15.021 --> 00:20:15.854
<v Speaker 2>they're sending.</v>

324
00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.553
<v Speaker 8>I think that kind of analysis is a dream</v>
<v Speaker 8>killer for me because I think when you </v>

325
00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.430
<v Speaker 8>analyze stuff too much you,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the next thing you know it's like,</v>

326
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.110
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>analyzing sex.</v>

327
00:20:29.111 --> 00:20:34.070
<v Speaker 8>I mean we should we write a report when </v>
<v Speaker 8>we're done check lists of,</v>

328
00:20:34.071 --> 00:20:35.440
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>two phones,</v>

329
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:36.580
<v Speaker 8>one to five.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How did you,</v>

330
00:20:36.581 --> 00:20:37.510
<v Speaker 8>how was it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

331
00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.050
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

332
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.310
<v Speaker 8>I think that kind of thinking is </v>
<v Speaker 8>dangerous for the creative process.</v>

333
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.150
<v Speaker 8>Like if you come in with that method and</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

334
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.680
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>whatever method of following.</v>

335
00:20:46.681 --> 00:20:47.471
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

336
00:20:47.471 --> 00:20:48.310
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

337
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:49.390
<v Speaker 8>look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't fall,</v>

338
00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:50.560
<v Speaker 8>what's his name?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Lorne.</v>

339
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:52.850
<v Speaker 8>Lorne michaels.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I wouldn't find his method.</v>

340
00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:53.684
<v Speaker 8>I'd follow my method.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Everybody has a different solar as </v>

341
00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 8>different way of singing that song.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think the collaborative process,</v>

342
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:00.694
<v Speaker 8>which is really what the journalist is </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking about is dictated by what you </v>

343
00:21:04.691 --> 00:21:06.820
<v Speaker 8>need to create and who's in the room.</v>

344
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.713
<v Speaker 8>And so that process works for that </v>
<v Speaker 8>particular group of people given the </v>

345
00:21:11.591 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 8>time constraints that exist.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know that that would work.</v>

346
00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.880
<v Speaker 8>If you are writing for a six part mini </v>
<v Speaker 8>series like I did.</v>

347
00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:19.714
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was one of the writers in a six part </v>

348
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:23.020
<v Speaker 8>mini series for David Simon and </v>
<v Speaker 8>creative.</v>

349
00:21:23.021 --> 00:21:26.560
<v Speaker 8>The wire has an area that's called the </v>
<v Speaker 8>parting the waters.</v>

350
00:21:26.561 --> 00:21:30.610
<v Speaker 8>It's about Taylor branch is three book </v>
<v Speaker 8>series about the civil rights movement.</v>

351
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.200
<v Speaker 8>I'll be watching myself,</v>
<v Speaker 8>ta-nehisi codes,</v>

352
00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.870
<v Speaker 8>tail brands,</v>
<v Speaker 8>David Simon.</v>

353
00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:39.310
<v Speaker 8>Now we're going there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What was it like being in a writing room</v>

354
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:43.060
<v Speaker 8>with David Simon and Tanahashi and like </v>
<v Speaker 8>how did that go?</v>

355
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:44.290
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was great.</v>

356
00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:44.951
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

357
00:21:44.951 --> 00:21:46.390
<v Speaker 8>that work.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it was free.</v>

358
00:21:46.391 --> 00:21:48.190
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>David didn't point that.</v>

359
00:21:48.191 --> 00:21:49.420
<v Speaker 8>She wouldn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what are you thinking?</v>

360
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.670
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he did it a different way and he said,</v>

361
00:21:51.671 --> 00:21:52.480
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

362
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.313
<v Speaker 8>we have to decide which story we're </v>
<v Speaker 8>going to tell and who's going to tell </v>

363
00:21:55.331 --> 00:21:56.164
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>

364
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.340
<v Speaker 8>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>count base,</v>

365
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.031
<v Speaker 8>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

366
00:21:58.031 --> 00:21:58.990
<v Speaker 8>he's like Duke Ellington,</v>
<v Speaker 8>me,</v>

367
00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:03.700
<v Speaker 8>like Duke Ellington had a band of great </v>
<v Speaker 8>soloists and he'd say,</v>

368
00:22:03.701 --> 00:22:06.700
<v Speaker 8>this is the composition.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Now put your thing to it.</v>

369
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.350
<v Speaker 8>David is the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

370
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.360
<v Speaker 8>he says this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these are the parameters.</v>

371
00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.263
<v Speaker 8>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're all small little kings and your </v>

372
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:13.663
<v Speaker 8>kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let's bring our kingdoms together and </v>

373
00:22:15.641 --> 00:22:18.760
<v Speaker 8>see which one of us can come up with the</v>
<v Speaker 8>best idea.</v>

374
00:22:18.761 --> 00:22:21.430
<v Speaker 8>Whoever has the best idea,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'll run with that.</v>

375
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 8>So you can't bring a lot of ego into a </v>
<v Speaker 8>room like that.</v>

376
00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.723
<v Speaker 8>You have to be at,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're there to serve as a story and a </v>

377
00:22:26.411 --> 00:22:30.070
<v Speaker 8>good writer will serve as the story.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A good musician will serve as the music.</v>

378
00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.100
<v Speaker 8>As a novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 8>how do you work?</v>

379
00:22:33.101 --> 00:22:36.080
<v Speaker 8>Do you plot out everything before you </v>
<v Speaker 8>write or,</v>

380
00:22:36.081 --> 00:22:37.140
<v Speaker 8>and you just,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

381
00:22:37.141 --> 00:22:39.430
<v Speaker 8>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have no standard way of doing it other</v>

382
00:22:39.431 --> 00:22:42.190
<v Speaker 8>than getting up at four o'clock in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>morning and getting to work.</v>

383
00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.153
<v Speaker 8>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can write at four o'clock in the </v>

384
00:22:44.441 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 8>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay,</v>

385
00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:45.970
<v Speaker 8>well I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

386
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:48.070
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go to bed at nine all right,</v>

387
00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.650
<v Speaker 8>if I go to bed at 11 I get up at four </v>
<v Speaker 8>o'clock anyway.</v>

388
00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:52.960
<v Speaker 8>I'll take a nap at 11:00</v>
<v Speaker 8>AM until,</v>

389
00:22:52.961 --> 00:22:53.681
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>

390
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:56.830
<v Speaker 8>the discipline of music taught me how </v>
<v Speaker 8>the necessity of practice.</v>

391
00:22:56.831 --> 00:22:59.560
<v Speaker 8>But going back to your earlier statement</v>
<v Speaker 8>about this room full of writers,</v>

392
00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:02.290
<v Speaker 8>if you're a real serious writer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you,</v>

393
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:05.500
<v Speaker 8>you are a servant to the story you </v>
<v Speaker 8>writing chooses you,</v>

394
00:23:05.501 --> 00:23:06.334
<v Speaker 8>you don't choose it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So when you're working with other </v>

395
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:10.540
<v Speaker 8>writers,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have to service the idea.</v>

396
00:23:10.541 --> 00:23:11.374
<v Speaker 8>And that's really where craft comes into</v>
<v Speaker 8>the trade shows itself because then you </v>

397
00:23:15.281 --> 00:23:17.740
<v Speaker 8>have to be able to throw left handed in </v>
<v Speaker 8>Bat,</v>

398
00:23:17.741 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 8>right handed a bat right hand and throw </v>
<v Speaker 8>left handed.</v>

399
00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:21.730
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have to be able to,</v>

400
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:24.610
<v Speaker 8>you have to be able to hit a curve ball </v>
<v Speaker 8>in the bottom of the seventh,</v>

401
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:25.493
<v Speaker 8>two out in guy on base.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You just have to be able to do it </v>

402
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:29.620
<v Speaker 8>because if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you bring in the whole team down.</v>

403
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:32.170
<v Speaker 8>So you have to learn how to play every </v>
<v Speaker 8>position.</v>

404
00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:35.560
<v Speaker 8>You're a person who's collab and you've </v>
<v Speaker 8>done musics and you've collaborated with</v>

405
00:23:35.561 --> 00:23:37.150
<v Speaker 8>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You've done theater.</v>

406
00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:40.210
<v Speaker 8>Tanahashi has written a comic book just </v>
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>

407
00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.350
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

408
00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:43.060
<v Speaker 8>so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just,</v>

409
00:23:43.061 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 8>I think of like some of these folks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

410
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.400
<v Speaker 8>William Faulkner,</v>

411
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.233
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the folks like sitting alone in their </v>

412
00:23:48.231 --> 00:23:49.064
<v Speaker 1>room for their whole lives would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably freak out if they suddenly had </v>

413
00:23:51.681 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 1>to share the table.</v>

414
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:54.360
<v Speaker 8>Prob more maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 8>maybe.</v>

415
00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.213
<v Speaker 8>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I must say that writing is a lonely </v>

416
00:23:58.141 --> 00:23:58.974
<v Speaker 8>life.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so working with other writers in </v>

417
00:24:01.201 --> 00:24:03.720
<v Speaker 8>this particular situation was just a lot</v>
<v Speaker 8>of fun.</v>

418
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.500
<v Speaker 8>And my problem is that at my age,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

419
00:24:07.501 --> 00:24:10.290
<v Speaker 8>I walk into a room and I started talking</v>
<v Speaker 8>to people get intimidated.</v>

420
00:24:10.291 --> 00:24:11.250
<v Speaker 8>They think that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

421
00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.050
<v Speaker 8>I know what I'm talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

422
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:14.790
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm,</v>

423
00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.820
<v Speaker 8>I reached the point in my life where I </v>
<v Speaker 8>don't really feel like I'm not,</v>

424
00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:18.803
<v Speaker 8>I stopped working hard at trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 8>people feel comfortable if they can't </v>

425
00:24:22.231 --> 00:24:23.930
<v Speaker 8>accept me on my own terms,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just to,</v>

426
00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.773
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they'll see shortly that it's cool and </v>

427
00:24:27.271 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 8>if they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>then there's nothing I,</v>

428
00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.880
<v Speaker 8>nothing I write or play or do is going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to make them feel comfortable anyway.</v>

429
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:34.343
<v Speaker 8>So I didn't have that problem when I was</v>
<v Speaker 8>working with David and Eric overmeyer </v>

430
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:40.230
<v Speaker 8>tiny he seen and Taylor branch,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

431
00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.123
<v Speaker 8>They were just cool.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We were all there for the same purpose </v>

432
00:24:43.411 --> 00:24:44.700
<v Speaker 8>and I really liked them all.</v>

433
00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.173
<v Speaker 1>And I ended in early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier mix tape with a spontaneous </v>

434
00:24:51.941 --> 00:24:54.160
<v Speaker 1>monologue from one of my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 1>writers,</v>

435
00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Howitt and rapper kate tempest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the whole conversation with her,</v>

436
00:24:59.721 --> 00:25:02.980
<v Speaker 1>it was incredibly illuminating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had just finished her first novel,</v>

437
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:04.023
<v Speaker 1>the bricks that built the houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here she talks fascinatingly about </v>

438
00:25:08.861 --> 00:25:09.694
<v Speaker 1>writer's block.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The surprise clip is from author </v>

439
00:25:12.371 --> 00:25:15.340
<v Speaker 1>Augusten burroughs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's talking about writer's block,</v>

440
00:25:15.341 --> 00:25:20.050
<v Speaker 1>which he believes is a real thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how kate responds to that.</v>

441
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:30.250
<v Speaker 3>The worst thing to do with writer's </v>
<v Speaker 3>block is kind of like the worst thing to</v>

442
00:25:30.381 --> 00:25:32.810
<v Speaker 3>do with back pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

443
00:25:32.811 --> 00:25:33.644
<v Speaker 3>if you have back pain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to stay in bed for the </v>

444
00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:36.434
<v Speaker 3>next five years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know you need to begin physical </v>

445
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:39.404
<v Speaker 3>therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to maybe do yoga or </v>

446
00:25:40.491 --> 00:25:44.000
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to move with writer's block.</v>

447
00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:46.550
<v Speaker 3>You don't stay away from the writing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>think,</v>

448
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.983
<v Speaker 3>I'll wait until the solution comes to me</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's not how it works for a </v>

449
00:25:52.911 --> 00:25:53.744
<v Speaker 3>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The solution comes to us as we're </v>

450
00:25:56.151 --> 00:25:58.670
<v Speaker 3>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes mid sentence.</v>

451
00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:03.590
<v Speaker 3>The solution to writer's block is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write about the writer's block.</v>

452
00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.050
<v Speaker 3>Why don't you have it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does it suck?</v>

453
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:07.063
<v Speaker 3>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why it could be a case of you knows </v>

454
00:26:08.601 --> 00:26:10.280
<v Speaker 3>you're off plot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're off point.</v>

455
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.290
<v Speaker 3>It could be that there's something </v>
<v Speaker 3>deeper,</v>

456
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:13.213
<v Speaker 3>better,</v>
<v Speaker 3>truer jucier that you really need to </v>

457
00:26:15.681 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 3>write about that maybe you're too </v>
<v Speaker 3>embarrassed to write.</v>

458
00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.100
<v Speaker 9>I'm of the opinion that there is no such</v>
<v Speaker 9>thing as writer's block.</v>

459
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:25.173
<v Speaker 9>I don't think it exists.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that there is the fear of </v>

460
00:26:28.061 --> 00:26:29.290
<v Speaker 9>writing badly.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's,</v>

461
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:32.010
<v Speaker 9>that's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And if you're afraid of writing badly,</v>

462
00:26:32.011 --> 00:26:35.140
<v Speaker 9>then and you're not going to be writing </v>
<v Speaker 9>because it's a,</v>

463
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.620
<v Speaker 9>it's a crippling fear that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but you just have to take that fear away</v>

464
00:26:38.621 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 9>from it until you saw the flower.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I love this shit today.</v>

465
00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:41.750
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right?</v>

466
00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:46.350
<v Speaker 9>It doesn't matter if it's good like </v>
<v Speaker 9>because the point of it is right.</v>

467
00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:50.240
<v Speaker 9>Anyone can have an idea anybody but </v>
<v Speaker 9>finishing an ideas what I'm saying?</v>

468
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.990
<v Speaker 9>That's the agony.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's difficult.</v>

469
00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 9>It's always difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's fucking hard work and apologies for</v>

470
00:26:56.461 --> 00:26:59.100
<v Speaker 9>swearing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but the point is,</v>

471
00:26:59.101 --> 00:26:59.934
<v Speaker 9>is that like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're kind of in competition with </v>

472
00:27:01.501 --> 00:27:03.690
<v Speaker 9>yourself already because you're trying </v>
<v Speaker 9>to improve.</v>

473
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.970
<v Speaker 9>You're trying to be better tomorrow than</v>
<v Speaker 9>you were yesterday.</v>

474
00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.850
<v Speaker 9>That's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But having an idea,</v>

475
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.050
<v Speaker 9>beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 9>perfect.</v>

476
00:27:10.051 --> 00:27:10.651
<v Speaker 9>It's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

477
00:27:10.651 --> 00:27:12.510
<v Speaker 9>it's going to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's going to be the best thing you've</v>

478
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:15.450
<v Speaker 9>ever done to the actual finished thing </v>
<v Speaker 9>is going to be clunky.</v>

479
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:18.270
<v Speaker 9>You're going to be ashamed of it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You're going to pick it apart.</v>

480
00:27:18.271 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 9>We're getting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can't get to sleep.</v>

481
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:20.790
<v Speaker 9>You're going to hate yourself for doing </v>
<v Speaker 9>it.</v>

482
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.313
<v Speaker 9>That's the point.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That's why you move on and have another </v>

483
00:27:23.881 --> 00:27:25.290
<v Speaker 9>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You finish things,</v>

484
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:27.750
<v Speaker 9>you finished things.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The stepping stones towards finding your</v>

485
00:27:27.751 --> 00:27:30.660
<v Speaker 9>voice.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like on on a writing day.</v>

486
00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:32.760
<v Speaker 9>If I don't feel,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if it's not happening,</v>

487
00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:33.990
<v Speaker 9>if it's not coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't,</v>

488
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.420
<v Speaker 9>I don't force it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I take a walk,</v>

489
00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:37.254
<v Speaker 9>like I stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 9>like I'm in a slightly different </v>

490
00:27:39.181 --> 00:27:40.014
<v Speaker 9>situation because I'm usually,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm usually quite up against it with </v>

491
00:27:42.331 --> 00:27:43.164
<v Speaker 9>deadlines.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I wrote the majority of this has it </v>

492
00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 9>fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it built the houses,</v>

493
00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:48.180
<v Speaker 9>kind of what I was on the road.</v>

494
00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.660
<v Speaker 9>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So in a tour bus full of other people?</v>

495
00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:52.523
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and it's all boss or in a cafe or in a </v>

496
00:27:53.981 --> 00:27:54.814
<v Speaker 9>service station or like in the three </v>
<v Speaker 9>days I had off between tours in my </v>

497
00:27:58.111 --> 00:27:58.944
<v Speaker 9>bedroom or whatever it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and the thing is like you can make all </v>

498
00:28:02.791 --> 00:28:06.600
<v Speaker 9>kinds of excuses that you can say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh I need some space and I need time and</v>

499
00:28:06.601 --> 00:28:07.434
<v Speaker 9>I need natural light.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I need a room with a view and I </v>

500
00:28:09.481 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 9>need,</v>
<v Speaker 9>or you can just,</v>

501
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.160
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can just finish it.</v>

502
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.590
<v Speaker 9>It's really hard,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but it's what,</v>

503
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:17.483
<v Speaker 9>it's what will make you better.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Say you don't take a walk and say you </v>

504
00:28:21.091 --> 00:28:25.050
<v Speaker 9>sit down and you make yourself right one</v>
<v Speaker 9>day and it comes out and it's shit.</v>

505
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:27.140
<v Speaker 9>You delete it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Do you rewrite it?</v>

506
00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:30.510
<v Speaker 9>It depends what you're working on.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I feel if I'm working on a play,</v>

507
00:28:31.020 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 9>you can hear,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you can feel when it's a bad line,</v>

508
00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:34.680
<v Speaker 9>it's suddenly you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>what?</v>

509
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.740
<v Speaker 9>Nobody would ever say that about this </v>
<v Speaker 9>character would never say that.</v>

510
00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:39.383
<v Speaker 9>But the thing is when,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when I'm up against the deadline or </v>

511
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.173
<v Speaker 9>usually it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm under a lot of pressure because of </v>

512
00:28:44.341 --> 00:28:47.070
<v Speaker 9>my schedule because I mean that's the </v>
<v Speaker 9>way I work and I'm happy about it.</v>

513
00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:47.904
<v Speaker 9>It's good for me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But sometimes there isn't time to be </v>

514
00:28:50.011 --> 00:28:54.050
<v Speaker 9>having an off day and that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's crazy pressure but it works.</v>

515
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:54.933
<v Speaker 9>Sometimes it works.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Other times I'm in a really great </v>

516
00:28:57.331 --> 00:29:00.390
<v Speaker 9>situation because writing can be quite </v>
<v Speaker 9>lonely pursuit.</v>

517
00:29:00.391 --> 00:29:02.490
<v Speaker 9>But then when you have an editor or in </v>
<v Speaker 9>music,</v>

518
00:29:02.491 --> 00:29:03.324
<v Speaker 9>I have a great music producer who I work</v>
<v Speaker 9>with or what are making theater or I </v>

519
00:29:05.521 --> 00:29:06.354
<v Speaker 9>have the director,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I worked with a director and there were </v>

520
00:29:08.261 --> 00:29:09.094
<v Speaker 9>these other people,</v>
<v Speaker 9>these kind of midwives that populate a </v>

521
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:15.150
<v Speaker 9>writer's life that help you to kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>get over yourself enough to just kind of</v>

522
00:29:15.151 --> 00:29:16.020
<v Speaker 9>deliver it,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

523
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:17.670
<v Speaker 9>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

524
00:29:17.671 --> 00:29:18.421
<v Speaker 9>with,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with this,</v>

525
00:29:18.421 --> 00:29:19.680
<v Speaker 9>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 9>with the bricks,</v>

526
00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.820
<v Speaker 9>the most exhilarating part of this </v>
<v Speaker 9>process was deleting 30,000</v>

527
00:29:23.821 --> 00:29:28.821
<v Speaker 9>words and feeling how good that was.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like suddenly it got lighter and it kind</v>

528
00:29:29.161 --> 00:29:31.050
<v Speaker 9>of held its shape a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 9>successfully.</v>

529
00:29:31.051 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 9>And I could just feel this thing that </v>
<v Speaker 9>I'd only ever heard writers talk about,</v>

530
00:29:34.381 --> 00:29:35.214
<v Speaker 9>but I'd never experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is like the kind of joy of just </v>

531
00:29:37.531 --> 00:29:38.520
<v Speaker 9>cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>cutting,</v>

532
00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.413
<v Speaker 9>cutting,</v>
<v Speaker 9>cutting and just watching it kind of </v>

533
00:29:40.741 --> 00:29:41.750
<v Speaker 9>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

534
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.510
<v Speaker 9>Really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So yeah,</v>

535
00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.513
<v Speaker 9>shout out loud as shit.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It'll stay there for a bit and then you </v>

536
00:29:48.011 --> 00:29:48.880
<v Speaker 9>lose it.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's all right,</v>

537
00:29:48.881 --> 00:29:49.190
<v Speaker 9>you know?</v>

538
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.023
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it sounds like a big part of your </v>

539
00:29:51.261 --> 00:29:53.840
<v Speaker 4>process is kind of the gun to your head,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just saying,</v>

540
00:29:53.841 --> 00:29:54.674
<v Speaker 4>basically I got to get this done and </v>
<v Speaker 4>putting yourself in a position where </v>

541
00:29:56.901 --> 00:29:57.734
<v Speaker 4>that's the case.</v>

542
00:29:57.820 --> 00:29:58.653
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And even before when there wasn't </v>

543
00:29:59.591 --> 00:30:00.424
<v Speaker 9>deadlines,</v>
<v Speaker 9>when I have no publisher or anything </v>

544
00:30:01.871 --> 00:30:02.704
<v Speaker 9>else,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I was still inflicting that kind of </v>

545
00:30:04.121 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 9>pressure on myself because I've always </v>
<v Speaker 9>felt that time is kind of against me.</v>

546
00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 9>I don't know why then if he feel like </v>
<v Speaker 9>that.</v>

547
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:11.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well increasingly,</v>

548
00:30:11.111 --> 00:30:15.340
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me it was interesting because I,</v>

549
00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:16.983
<v Speaker 4>I grew up relatively privileged and had </v>
<v Speaker 4>the privilege slash curse of being able </v>

550
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:22.204
<v Speaker 4>to kind of wander around and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took me longer to feel that the gun </v>

551
00:30:25.361 --> 00:30:27.440
<v Speaker 4>of time to my head.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

552
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:30.070
<v Speaker 4>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know much about your background,</v>

553
00:30:30.071 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 4>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know from the fact that so much of the</v>

554
00:30:33.791 --> 00:30:34.624
<v Speaker 4>press is about your being from southeast</v>
<v Speaker 4>London and the neighborhood that you </v>

555
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:39.760
<v Speaker 4>focus on and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm guessing you may be,</v>

556
00:30:39.761 --> 00:30:43.420
<v Speaker 4>didn't have people sending you off to </v>
<v Speaker 4>wander around.</v>

557
00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:49.090
<v Speaker 9>I didn't get some really good supportive</v>
<v Speaker 9>environment,</v>

558
00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:51.403
<v Speaker 9>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the way that south London figures in my </v>

559
00:30:54.201 --> 00:30:56.660
<v Speaker 9>work and then in myself,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's like,</v>

560
00:30:56.661 --> 00:30:59.240
<v Speaker 9>it's such a huge Paul.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>

561
00:30:59.241 --> 00:31:00.074
<v Speaker 9>because if you grow up in a big city,</v>
<v Speaker 9>especially in a pot in a city that's so </v>

562
00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:04.701
<v Speaker 9>south London,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it,</v>

563
00:31:04.701 --> 00:31:07.730
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>so I suppose for an American audience to</v>

564
00:31:07.731 --> 00:31:08.720
<v Speaker 9>kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

565
00:31:08.730 --> 00:31:10.430
<v Speaker 9>southeastern,</v>
<v Speaker 9>then it probably doesn't mean anything.</v>

566
00:31:10.431 --> 00:31:11.030
<v Speaker 9>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

567
00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:12.350
<v Speaker 9>unless you've spent some time and none </v>
<v Speaker 9>of them,</v>

568
00:31:12.351 --> 00:31:14.990
<v Speaker 9>but the kind of character of it in my </v>
<v Speaker 9>head,</v>

569
00:31:14.991 --> 00:31:19.220
<v Speaker 9>the way that it is a very creative place</v>
<v Speaker 9>in terms of people who are really making</v>

570
00:31:19.221 --> 00:31:21.550
<v Speaker 9>something happen there.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I felt in my,</v>

571
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:26.030
<v Speaker 9>it's very mixed place culturally,</v>
<v Speaker 9>racially,</v>

572
00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:27.133
<v Speaker 9>and economically,</v>
<v Speaker 9>lots of different people live in very </v>

573
00:31:28.791 --> 00:31:29.624
<v Speaker 9>close together.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's a certain sensibility that it </v>

574
00:31:31.191 --> 00:31:33.020
<v Speaker 9>gives you if you're from there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is,</v>

575
00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:34.760
<v Speaker 9>it's quite a rough area.</v>

576
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:35.763
<v Speaker 9>It was like the highest,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the highest rates of teenage pregnancy </v>

577
00:31:38.121 --> 00:31:41.180
<v Speaker 9>and murder amongst teenagers when I was </v>
<v Speaker 9>growing up in Lewisham,</v>

578
00:31:41.181 --> 00:31:42.350
<v Speaker 9>which is the borrower,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'll go up,</v>

579
00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:43.483
<v Speaker 9>but at the same time there's a huge </v>
<v Speaker 9>amount of music and huge amount of </v>

580
00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:47.713
<v Speaker 9>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 9>vibrant creativity and I found it to be </v>

581
00:31:50.731 --> 00:31:54.120
<v Speaker 9>a really positive place.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I grew up in a very good home.</v>

582
00:31:54.121 --> 00:31:56.300
<v Speaker 9>My Dad was a lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my mom was a teacher.</v>

583
00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:59.480
<v Speaker 9>We just lived in this area that was like</v>
<v Speaker 9>full of full of life,</v>

584
00:31:59.481 --> 00:32:00.314
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was just full of life and every time </v>

585
00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.100
<v Speaker 9>I walked out of the door and down the </v>
<v Speaker 9>street,</v>

586
00:32:04.101 --> 00:32:07.470
<v Speaker 9>every time I ever went anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I would pass by thousands if not fucking</v>

587
00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.530
<v Speaker 9>tens of thousands of people because it's</v>
<v Speaker 9>London,</v>

588
00:32:09.531 --> 00:32:13.310
<v Speaker 9>it's a big city,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and I just always felt so close to life,</v>

589
00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:14.330
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it was just everywhere.</v>

590
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:18.820
<v Speaker 9>And that I have a huge love for people </v>
<v Speaker 9>like the rubber,</v>

591
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.663
<v Speaker 9>not so obvious to say,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but I'm really moved by just like being </v>

592
00:32:22.641 --> 00:32:27.080
<v Speaker 9>amongst strangers and feeling connected </v>
<v Speaker 9>to their humanity and feeling this thing</v>

593
00:32:27.081 --> 00:32:28.110
<v Speaker 9>I'm talking about earlier.</v>

594
00:32:28.110 --> 00:32:32.420
<v Speaker 9>What about this kind of current reality </v>
<v Speaker 9>that we are denied access to?</v>

595
00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.853
<v Speaker 9>I think there is something about a kind </v>
<v Speaker 9>of a frequency that our rights are </v>

596
00:32:36.531 --> 00:32:39.140
<v Speaker 9>exists on looking for the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>looking,</v>

597
00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.630
<v Speaker 9>the internal experience of strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You know,</v>

598
00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.420
<v Speaker 9>I don't really know why,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but yeah,</v>

599
00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.610
<v Speaker 9>I watched somebody walk down the street </v>
<v Speaker 9>and the way that they're carrying their,</v>

600
00:32:46.850 --> 00:32:47.683
<v Speaker 9>their car keys,</v>
<v Speaker 9>something about the way they just </v>

601
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:49.784
<v Speaker 9>dropped their shopping bag.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like I feel so blown away by a tiny </v>

602
00:32:52.101 --> 00:32:52.940
<v Speaker 9>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>

603
00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:57.470
<v Speaker 9>They kind of sends me into this like </v>
<v Speaker 9>deep passion for these people,</v>

604
00:32:57.471 --> 00:32:58.220
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>for,</v>

605
00:32:58.220 --> 00:32:59.053
<v Speaker 9>for somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I think that the writer is </v>

606
00:32:59.991 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 9>constantly feeling kind of outside of </v>
<v Speaker 9>life,</v>

607
00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:05.000
<v Speaker 9>which is what sends us to the page </v>
<v Speaker 9>often,</v>

608
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:05.863
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>trying to write ourselves into this </v>

609
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:11.410
<v Speaker 9>existence that we were kind of </v>
<v Speaker 9>constantly because we observed so much I</v>

610
00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:12.244
<v Speaker 9>kind of outside of things.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But the observation is one of like pure </v>

611
00:33:14.631 --> 00:33:15.464
<v Speaker 9>love.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Really.</v>

612
00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.161
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I got,</v>

613
00:33:16.161 --> 00:33:19.530
<v Speaker 9>I got lost in south London and I found </v>
<v Speaker 9>myself there but you know,</v>

614
00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:23.150
<v Speaker 9>got into all kinds of trouble and all </v>
<v Speaker 9>kinds of like beautiful,</v>

615
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:23.984
<v Speaker 9>beautiful things happened.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And I still live there and it's still </v>

616
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:26.440
<v Speaker 9>home.</v>

617
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.273
<v Speaker 4>You know in the book there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you talk about gentrification and </v>

618
00:33:30.451 --> 00:33:31.284
<v Speaker 4>there's this sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it seems like you feel like the </v>

619
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:35.993
<v Speaker 4>heart of south London is still intact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that there's this threat somehow of </v>

620
00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.590
<v Speaker 4>it being co opted or,</v>

621
00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.070
<v Speaker 9>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's strange because the,</v>

622
00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.590
<v Speaker 9>I think it's more helpful because this </v>
<v Speaker 9>conversation about gentrification,</v>

623
00:33:50.591 --> 00:33:53.740
<v Speaker 9>it happens all over the world and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 9>tragedy.</v>

624
00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:54.723
<v Speaker 9>But the minute where I've been thinking </v>
<v Speaker 9>about it is it's more useful actually </v>

625
00:33:57.051 --> 00:34:01.240
<v Speaker 9>need to pan out of this a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 9>think about what this means it in a kind</v>

626
00:34:01.241 --> 00:34:02.074
<v Speaker 9>of why the framework,</v>
<v Speaker 9>which is this kind of symptomatic greed </v>

627
00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:10.080
<v Speaker 9>and the exploitation of land for profit </v>
<v Speaker 9>above people and this year you could,</v>

628
00:34:10.210 --> 00:34:11.050
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>yes,</v>

629
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.453
<v Speaker 9>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's a real shame shaft on this </v>

630
00:34:13.931 --> 00:34:14.830
<v Speaker 9>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 9>My God,</v>

631
00:34:14.831 --> 00:34:15.664
<v Speaker 9>it hurts.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But if we pan out a little bit and we </v>

632
00:34:17.261 --> 00:34:20.860
<v Speaker 9>think about land,</v>
<v Speaker 9>land is being exploited for profit,</v>

633
00:34:20.861 --> 00:34:22.840
<v Speaker 9>the people that live on that land are </v>
<v Speaker 9>being destroyed.</v>

634
00:34:22.841 --> 00:34:24.490
<v Speaker 9>The community is that culture has been </v>
<v Speaker 9>destroyed.</v>

635
00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:27.520
<v Speaker 9>This isn't just happening in cities,</v>
<v Speaker 9>it's just happening all over the world.</v>

636
00:34:27.521 --> 00:34:28.354
<v Speaker 9>It's happening to the first Australians.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's happening in the rainforest and </v>

637
00:34:30.221 --> 00:34:30.650
<v Speaker 9>primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

638
00:34:30.650 --> 00:34:34.390
<v Speaker 9>it's like there is a greed that is </v>
<v Speaker 9>running,</v>

639
00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:36.110
<v Speaker 9>running the world.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>

640
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:39.000
<v Speaker 9>it's greed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>There's no empathy and I</v>

641
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.553
<v Speaker 4>alienation happens not only to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>communities that are destroyed but to </v>

642
00:34:44.941 --> 00:34:46.740
<v Speaker 4>the destroyers as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

643
00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:47.603
<v Speaker 4>I just think that the world that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>built up upon the wreckage of these </v>

644
00:34:51.571 --> 00:34:52.404
<v Speaker 4>communities is also a world in which </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's difficult to form community like </v>

645
00:34:56.401 --> 00:34:57.234
<v Speaker 4>new communities.</v>

646
00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.250
<v Speaker 9>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

647
00:34:58.251 --> 00:34:59.210
<v Speaker 9>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

648
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 9>I've never lived in a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

649
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:05.750
<v Speaker 9>I think that like this has to go both </v>
<v Speaker 9>ways.</v>

650
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:07.520
<v Speaker 9>So if I say that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

651
00:35:07.521 --> 00:35:10.130
<v Speaker 9>I love people and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm for people,</v>

652
00:35:10.131 --> 00:35:13.040
<v Speaker 9>I can't be just for people that I </v>
<v Speaker 9>already agree with,</v>

653
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.280
<v Speaker 9>like this has to go both ways.</v>
<v Speaker 9>You have to,</v>

654
00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:18.110
<v Speaker 9>recently I've been thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 9>okay,</v>

655
00:35:18.111 --> 00:35:22.130
<v Speaker 9>so you need to empower even the very </v>
<v Speaker 9>powerful to be more real with themselves</v>

656
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:22.973
<v Speaker 9>that actually think about the cost.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The only thing I can think to say is </v>

657
00:35:27.351 --> 00:35:29.630
<v Speaker 9>just empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It does need more empathy.</v>

658
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.910
<v Speaker 9>It's very easy for artists,</v>

659
00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:33.053
<v Speaker 4>a buddy to basically cut themselves off </v>
<v Speaker 4>from all the rest of that humanity and </v>

660
00:35:36.211 --> 00:35:39.870
<v Speaker 4>find some way to people and say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

661
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:42.020
<v Speaker 4>that person is to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

662
00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.900
<v Speaker 4>that's a greedy corporate person,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or that's a this person or that,</v>

663
00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:46.763
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I think it's hard for anyone to to </v>

664
00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:52.410
<v Speaker 4>remind themselves and try to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to like</v>

665
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.790
<v Speaker 9>not shutoff difficult because part of me</v>
<v Speaker 9>just recoils and kind of wishes that the</v>

666
00:35:58.971 --> 00:36:01.780
<v Speaker 9>world was kind of run by these reptilian</v>
<v Speaker 9>monsters.</v>

667
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.313
<v Speaker 9>The reality is that the human beings are</v>
<v Speaker 9>human beings that are making these </v>

668
00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:06.794
<v Speaker 9>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And so at the beginning of this </v>

669
00:36:08.571 --> 00:36:10.040
<v Speaker 9>conversation we were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

670
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:10.874
<v Speaker 9>whether this kind of grappling between </v>
<v Speaker 9>what we're capable of and what we are </v>

671
00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:16.213
<v Speaker 9>inherent nature is.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And actually what I believe that </v>

672
00:36:18.411 --> 00:36:21.290
<v Speaker 9>inherently we are physiologically </v>
<v Speaker 9>empathic beings.</v>

673
00:36:21.291 --> 00:36:21.870
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>That was,</v>

674
00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:22.703
<v Speaker 9>that was a study that that took place </v>
<v Speaker 9>where I learned about this in the </v>

675
00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.240
<v Speaker 9>Science Museum in London.</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I know it's true,</v>

676
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.250
<v Speaker 9>right?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So they took two strangers,</v>

677
00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:32.780
<v Speaker 9>put them in a,</v>
<v Speaker 9>in a room,</v>

678
00:36:32.781 --> 00:36:33.614
<v Speaker 9>separated by a glass partition.</v>
<v Speaker 9>And one of them stood on a block of ice </v>

679
00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.593
<v Speaker 9>and the temperature of the others,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the temperature of the other person's </v>

680
00:36:41.181 --> 00:36:45.770
<v Speaker 9>feet dropped in response to watching </v>
<v Speaker 9>another human being who they didn't know</v>

681
00:36:45.771 --> 00:36:46.604
<v Speaker 9>stand on a block of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Like our bodies are chained into each </v>

682
00:36:48.741 --> 00:36:51.650
<v Speaker 9>other's.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It's like if I see like I see your wound</v>

683
00:36:51.651 --> 00:36:52.940
<v Speaker 9>on you,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I will recoil,</v>

684
00:36:52.941 --> 00:36:54.350
<v Speaker 9>it will hurt me at some level.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>

685
00:36:54.850 --> 00:36:55.683
<v Speaker 4>We have to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People have to learn not to be able to </v>

686
00:36:58.061 --> 00:36:58.894
<v Speaker 4>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

687
00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.420
<v Speaker 9>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Yeah.</v>

688
00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.253
<v Speaker 9>But so like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but we've kind of fed this thing about </v>

689
00:37:02.731 --> 00:37:06.720
<v Speaker 9>Humana being this like inherently like </v>
<v Speaker 9>aggressive,</v>

690
00:37:06.721 --> 00:37:08.730
<v Speaker 9>competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 9>selfish.</v>

691
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:09.913
<v Speaker 9>I don't believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I think that that is something that has </v>

692
00:37:11.971 --> 00:37:15.030
<v Speaker 9>encouraged this kind of myth of the </v>
<v Speaker 9>individual,</v>

693
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:18.270
<v Speaker 9>which is very helpful for capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 9>but not very helpful for humanity.</v>

694
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.490
<v Speaker 9>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 9>I mean fierce</v>

695
00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:23.710
<v Speaker 4>to be a pretty strong forest within </v>
<v Speaker 4>humanity as well.</v>

696
00:37:23.711 --> 00:37:26.380
<v Speaker 4>And it seems to me that a lot of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff arises from fear,</v>

697
00:37:26.381 --> 00:37:27.190
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

698
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 4>the primal fear goes all the way back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

699
00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:30.671
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>

700
00:37:30.671 --> 00:37:32.170
<v Speaker 4>we're afraid of death,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

701
00:37:32.171 --> 00:37:34.000
<v Speaker 4>is probably where it begins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

702
00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:37.150
<v Speaker 4>But fear of scarcity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fear of whatever,</v>

703
00:37:37.151 --> 00:37:40.080
<v Speaker 4>like fear of somebody taking what's </v>
<v Speaker 4>ours.</v>

704
00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:42.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably pretty old.</v>

705
00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:42.960
<v Speaker 9>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm,</v>

706
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.550
<v Speaker 9>no,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I'm with the you and I think,</v>

707
00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.910
<v Speaker 9>I think yes of course.</v>
<v Speaker 9>But like once you are,</v>

708
00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.460
<v Speaker 9>sounds so kind of far fetched and also </v>
<v Speaker 9>so easy.</v>

709
00:37:50.461 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 9>But this is kind of where I'm at at the </v>
<v Speaker 9>minute is if you're,</v>

710
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:54.023
<v Speaker 9>if you're there,</v>
<v Speaker 9>if you're present with yourself and </v>

711
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.110
<v Speaker 9>suddenly like the,</v>
<v Speaker 9>the worry of things,</v>

712
00:37:58.111 --> 00:37:58.944
<v Speaker 9>the anxiety of things to come.</v>
<v Speaker 9>This is not important because you're </v>

713
00:38:00.561 --> 00:38:01.650
<v Speaker 9>just,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you're just where you are,</v>

714
00:38:01.651 --> 00:38:03.840
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 9>and you can deal with it when it comes.</v>

715
00:38:03.841 --> 00:38:06.960
<v Speaker 9>But I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I don't know.</v>

716
00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.120
<v Speaker 9>I'm a sudden he was about to say </v>
<v Speaker 9>something extremely kind of new agey and</v>

717
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.640
<v Speaker 9>I stopped myself.</v>
<v Speaker 9>I still feel something else.</v>

718
00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:15.390
<v Speaker 9>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 9>good.</v>

719
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:16.223
<v Speaker 9>Next subject.</v>

720
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's it for this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think again,</v>

721
00:38:22.951 --> 00:38:23.784
<v Speaker 4>mixed tape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I'm calling the writer's room </v>

722
00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:26.873
<v Speaker 4>gathering some of the most poignant and </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting advice that I've heard some </v>

723
00:38:30.451 --> 00:38:35.040
<v Speaker 4>writers on writing over the past year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're listening and liking the,</v>

724
00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 4>you're probably sick of</v>

725
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.873
<v Speaker 1>hearing me say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I wish that I could personally </v>

726
00:38:39.101 --> 00:38:39.934
<v Speaker 1>remove this message from all the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes of everyone who has gone and </v>

727
00:38:44.051 --> 00:38:45.580
<v Speaker 1>done this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at any rate,</v>

728
00:38:45.581 --> 00:38:46.414
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could go and read or review the </v>

729
00:38:49.781 --> 00:38:51.940
<v Speaker 1>show on Itunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stitcher,</v>

730
00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:52.923
<v Speaker 1>wherever it is you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really doesn't take very long and it </v>

731
00:38:55.751 --> 00:38:59.590
<v Speaker 1>makes a major difference in terms of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows sustainability.</v>

732
00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:03.010
<v Speaker 1>We have an amazing season coming up now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's fall,</v>

733
00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.600
<v Speaker 1>and I hope to see you next week.</v>
