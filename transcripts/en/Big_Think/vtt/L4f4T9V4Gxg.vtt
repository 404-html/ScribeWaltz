00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No particular event comes to my mind or</v>

3
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly true that in the post</v>

4
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:26.240
<v Speaker 2>World War Two era when I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was born in 1939,</v>

5
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 2>so you can do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me.</v>

6
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Lots of stuff was happening in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

7
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York City.</v>

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.940
<v Speaker 2>The United Nations was being built.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lever House was being built.</v>

9
00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 2>I remember seeing lever has when it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>nearing completion for the first time</v>

10
00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 2>because my dentist office was down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>block,</v>

11
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that you could see at the museum</v>

12
00:00:48.021 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 2>of Modern Art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the various houses that were built in</v>

13
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 2>the garden.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to all of them with my parents.</v>

14
00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:58.631
<v Speaker 2>Took me to the and so let's say</v>
<v Speaker 2>subliminally that interested me.</v>

15
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:04.211
<v Speaker 2>I did have a teacher in a junior high</v>
<v Speaker 2>school and she was the art teacher or an</v>

16
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:09.881
<v Speaker 2>art teacher and her brother was a city</v>
<v Speaker 2>planner and when I expressed my</v>

17
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 2>interests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose he.</v>

18
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.910
<v Speaker 2>She connected me to the brother who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in Cleveland as I recall.</v>

19
00:01:16.911 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 2>So it was just the fact that there was</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody out there might be interested</v>

20
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:22.600
<v Speaker 2>in what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making little drawings.</v>
