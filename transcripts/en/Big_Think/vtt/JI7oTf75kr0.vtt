1
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Important because it studies those big</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions I mentioned,</v>

2
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.100
<v Speaker 1>especially the big question of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>should I live.</v>

3
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can be indifferent to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs to have an answer to</v>

4
00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most people don't think about it</v>

5
00:00:25.541 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 1>very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people live and think at the level</v>

6
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>of a Dva or if they're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful,</v>

7
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:38.491
<v Speaker 1>they move it up to magazines or</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally they'll read a book.</v>

8
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 1>But behind all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>above all those layers are the great</v>

9
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sources of the thoughts that are</v>

10
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elaborated and the trickle down to</v>

11
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That uh,</v>

12
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>we wouldn't pay enough attention to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily necessities of life or the moral</v>

13
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.050
<v Speaker 1>virtues of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>living with others who aren't a</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophers or political philosophers.</v>

15
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

16
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a narrowing and you might</v>

17
00:01:18.761 --> 00:01:23.761
<v Speaker 1>even forget a thing or two by being so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so isolated or,</v>

18
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

19
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.130
<v Speaker 1>or so high above</v>

20
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>most peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to keep it</v>

21
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>true to the great books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our tradition.</v>

22
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>Our tradition is our substance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our tradition is a tradition of</v>

23
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>questioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not a stultifying tradition.</v>

24
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>It's a tradition that keeps us aware.</v>

25
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Rake the lie.</v>
