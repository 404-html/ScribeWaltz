00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with vegetarian</v>
<v Speaker 1>diets and there's nothing wrong with</v>

3
00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:15.190
<v Speaker 1>Vegan diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people who eat those kinds of diets</v>

4
00:00:15.191 --> 00:00:19.240
<v Speaker 1>are often the healthier than people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't because they're eating a lot.</v>

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.840
<v Speaker 1>They're doing exactly what my advice is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating less,</v>

6
00:00:22.841 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>they're moving more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're eating lots of fruits,</v>

7
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whole grains,</v>

8
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 1>and they're certainly not eating much</v>
<v Speaker 1>junk food.</v>

9
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm so they're healthier.</v>
