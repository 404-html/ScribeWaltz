1
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.840
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that impresses me every</v>
<v Speaker 1>time I go into the sea and it should</v>

2
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:14.680
<v Speaker 1>impress everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the abundance of life.</v>

3
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>The ocean is not just rocks and water</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the surface,</v>

4
00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>it looks pretty much the same everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go.</v>

5
00:00:21.311 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's a little bluer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greener or grayer than others,</v>

6
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:30.211
<v Speaker 1>but most people I think have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impression that it's all about water and</v>

7
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>water of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the key to life.</v>

8
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a single non negotiable thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>life requires,</v>

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>but because most diverse water is ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of expect that's where most of</v>

10
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>life will be in and that's the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way it is.</v>

11
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Dive into the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's life all the way down.</v>

12
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like diving into the history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life on earth to look around when you're</v>

13
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:02.470
<v Speaker 1>in the sea because you see not just our</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow vertebrates,</v>

14
00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>so there there are plenty of them.</v>

15
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>The fish and some cases you have lucky</v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters with whales or dolphins.</v>

16
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.410
<v Speaker 1>You might see turtles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow vertebrates.</v>

17
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>You might even see if you're in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galapagos islands,</v>

18
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>Iguanas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fellow vertebrates,</v>

19
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>but the great sweep of life is mostly</v>
<v Speaker 1>not about vertebrates.</v>

20
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 1>It's about the invertebrates creatures</v>
<v Speaker 1>without backbones starting with a little</v>

21
00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>tiny things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The microbes that rule the world,</v>

22
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>they were in the ocean in abundance long</v>
<v Speaker 1>before there were organisms that had</v>

23
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:44.851
<v Speaker 1>multicellular structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so having a chance to dive in and to be</v>

24
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>aware even though you can't see them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that you're surrounded by this</v>

25
00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>great sweep of tiny things that generate</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of the oxygen that grab much of the</v>

26
00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.941
<v Speaker 1>carbon out of the atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photosynthetic bacteria and other</v>

27
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>forms of photosynthetic life that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>abundance.</v>

28
00:02:08.171 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 1>In plankton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really see them for the most</v>

29
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>part unless you have high magnification</v>
<v Speaker 1>and divers usually just have a face</v>

30
00:02:15.741 --> 00:02:16.574
<v Speaker 1>mask.</v>

31
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.120
<v Speaker 1>You might see that the water's a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>greener or not.</v>

32
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes you can actually see little</v>
<v Speaker 1>particles,</v>

33
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>but those are relatively large compared</v>
<v Speaker 1>to those really tiny things that even</v>

34
00:02:28.841 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>with the closest look you can deliver</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your eyes.</v>

35
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:36.511
<v Speaker 1>You really can't see the bacteria that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are there and in great abundance and in</v>

36
00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.500
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.270
<v Speaker 1>a cup of water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may have millions of bacteria,</v>

38
00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.370
<v Speaker 1>may have a thousand different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these little microbes.</v>

39
00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.610
<v Speaker 1>It looks like water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still filled with life,</v>

40
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.980
<v Speaker 1>and of course there are the bigger</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

41
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.860
<v Speaker 1>You're down on the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might see sponges.</v>

42
00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>They've been around for hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of years,</v>

43
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$500,</v>

44
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:07.210
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might see starfish.</v>

45
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>There are ancient citizens to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back 500 million years.</v>

46
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>You might see jellyfish pulsing by think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 500 million years,</v>

47
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>half a billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you see some other creatures that</v>

48
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 1>have taken a little longer to form in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of looking at the history of life</v>

49
00:03:33.431 --> 00:03:34.264
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>

50
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Horseshoe crabs have a history that goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>back perhaps as much as 400 million</v>

51
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:43.450
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other arthropods creatures that have</v>

52
00:03:43.451 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>jointed legs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crabs,</v>

53
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.460
<v Speaker 1>a horseshoe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crabs aren't true.</v>

54
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Crabs there clip more closely related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiders and Scorpions even though</v>

55
00:03:52.151 --> 00:03:56.990
<v Speaker 1>they're out there in the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but crabs and shrimp and little Copa</v>

56
00:03:56.991 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>pods that feed on the algae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the photosynthetic things that formed</v>

57
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 1>the basis of much of the great food</v>
<v Speaker 1>chains,</v>

58
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>food webs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ocean.</v>

59
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>All of that surrounds you as you dive</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

60
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:14.371
<v Speaker 1>You see creatures whose history preceded</v>
<v Speaker 1>that have certainly humankind or</v>

61
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:19.561
<v Speaker 1>anything closely related to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe sharks or they have a backbone or</v>

62
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.600
<v Speaker 1>back cartilage anyway that have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>history that goes back at least $300,</v>

63
00:04:24.601 --> 00:04:27.450
<v Speaker 1>million years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are really newcomers.</v>

64
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Our history is maybe contained within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 5 million years or anything</v>

65
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:38.461
<v Speaker 1>like human civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about 50,000 years or really when</v>

66
00:04:40.841 --> 00:04:45.610
<v Speaker 1>you think about civilization with</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and art and things that we</v>

67
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:50.611
<v Speaker 1>really associate with who we think we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are maybe the last 10,000 years since</v>

68
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the end of the last ice age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing in the history of the</v>

69
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.840
<v Speaker 1>earth or life on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a diver,</v>

70
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can think of yourself as almost an</v>

71
00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A newcomer on this ancient planet filled</v>

72
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:10.951
<v Speaker 1>with creatures whose life preceded that</v>
<v Speaker 1>of humankind by hundreds fruits</v>

73
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 2>of millions of years.</v>
