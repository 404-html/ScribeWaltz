00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>I hate interviewing people because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>very rarely level with you,</v>

2
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.223
<v Speaker 1>and so although it would be interesting </v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit down with Joseph Stalin and say </v>

3
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.720
<v Speaker 1>on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you delude yourself about Nazi plans</v>

4
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.793
<v Speaker 1>for the invasion of the Soviet Union in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1941 and nearly destroy your own </v>

5
00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:38.030
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he would tell me the truth</v>

6
00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.460
<v Speaker 1>on balance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an historian,</v>

7
00:00:40.461 --> 00:00:41.294
<v Speaker 1>I've always chosen the dead over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>living for the very good reason that </v>

8
00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.673
<v Speaker 1>they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That letters and diaries are far prefer </v>

9
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>to what they might have told me in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>

10
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>So if you forced my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably.</v>

11
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.014
<v Speaker 1>I would probably like to spend some time</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Stalin even though he was probably </v>

12
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the most frightening man of the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

13
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.963
<v Speaker 1>Most people who've spent time with him </v>
<v Speaker 1>were filled with fear through </v>

14
00:01:07.141 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>throughout.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>

15
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.000
<v Speaker 1>it would be a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a fascinating experience.</v>
