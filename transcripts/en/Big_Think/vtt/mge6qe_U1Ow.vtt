1
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>A lot of it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>the transcendental experience I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>

3
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading the Lord of the rings</v>

4
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>in about eighth grade and just finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

5
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>inexperience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that,</v>

6
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>just the level of engagement and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity in that experience that,</v>

7
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>the rest of my life didn't really match,</v>
<v Speaker 1>match up to that.</v>

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was also had that impulse to,</v>

10
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>if I liked something or was excited by</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

11
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never was that comfortable in the role</v>

13
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>of fan and I knew a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

14
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:51.724
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

15
00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people I knew who just were</v>

16
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>fanatical baseball fans and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>enrich their lives to kind of go to a</v>

17
00:00:59.761 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>lot of games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more about statistics and everybody</v>

18
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if I,</v>

19
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I like baseball,</v>

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to play baseball and certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened to me with a rock and roll</v>

21
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>when I was about 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13.</v>

22
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I started listening to a led Zeppelin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aerosmith,</v>

24
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>David Bowie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

26
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>really to me that was a central center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my high school experience was,</v>

27
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.140
<v Speaker 1>was just music and trying to make music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something that I had very</v>

28
00:01:28.141 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 1>little talent for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I knew a lot of talented musicians.</v>

29
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>I could play a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

30
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:35.170
<v Speaker 1>but not well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

31
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>at the same time I was reading really</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely and starting to think about</v>

32
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:41.220
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I picked up a pen and tried to</v>

33
00:01:41.221 --> 00:01:43.440
<v Speaker 1>write a story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the feeling that was completely</v>

34
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 1>different from the feeling I had holding</v>
<v Speaker 1>a guitar and feeling like,</v>

35
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not my native language.</v>

36
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to do this.</v>

37
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>If somebody showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could kind of,</v>

38
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can make my fingers do what they told</v>

39
00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>me to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't intuitively feel the</v>

40
00:01:58.201 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>

41
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I started to write stories,</v>

42
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.201
<v Speaker 1>I immediately felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

43
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know where you'd go now.</v>

44
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew when it started doing to stop,</v>

45
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came relatively easily.</v>

47
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I would say that that feeling of,</v>

48
00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

49
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>that kind of was the first thing that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>really loved in life.</v>

50
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>That I felt like I could do at the level</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to do.</v>

51
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

52
00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I did discover that in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in high school.</v>

53
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So by the time I got to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very clear with everyone.</v>

54
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:30.661
<v Speaker 1>I knew they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 1>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

56
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>I want to be a writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>so I guess that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.710
<v Speaker 1>relatively early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be surprised if a lot of other</v>

59
00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:45.711
<v Speaker 1>writers didn't say the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read as a kid.</v>

60
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 1>And My mother certainly encouraged it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't educated people,</v>

61
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:51.610
<v Speaker 1>they were working class people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:02:55.421 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I often meet a writers who have</v>

64
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>similar stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember in high school going to the</v>

66
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>library and asking for the Magic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mountain.</v>

67
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>I had discovered Thomas Mann and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the librarian kept telling me that,</v>

68
00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I must be mistaken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to read the magic</v>

69
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:17.380
<v Speaker 1>mountain because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody in this high school probably ever</v>

70
00:03:17.381 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>had taken the magic out of the library.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I said,</v>

71
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:20.210
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

72
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>I've been reading Thomas Mann,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read death in Venice.</v>

73
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:22.901
<v Speaker 1>I read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Mario and the magician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

75
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>the seven short novels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were great and I want to</v>

76
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>read the Magic Mountain and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.860
<v Speaker 1>so it seems funny now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

78
00:03:31.861 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>but I'd certainly didn't have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly literary childhood.</v>

79
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I had,</v>

80
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 1>I had some very good English teachers in</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sort of,</v>

81
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly average public high school in</v>

82
00:03:46.781 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey.</v>

83
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:51.460
<v Speaker 1>But once they knew that I liked to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they certainly had suggestions.</v>

84
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

85
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teacher probably in 11th grade who,</v>

86
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said all,</v>

87
00:03:57.881 --> 00:04:01.430
<v Speaker 1>you got to read a Raymond Chandler and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I went on a binge of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a reading,</v>

89
00:04:04.001 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>hard boiled detective fiction back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still feel the</v>

90
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.570
<v Speaker 1>influence that that had on my writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I found Chandler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a stunningly good,</v>

92
00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and I found that writing so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so bold and funny and colorful.</v>

93
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still think of that as a kind of ideal</v>

94
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.460
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a pro style and like,</v>

95
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's just a recommendation from a</v>

96
00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:27.130
<v Speaker 1>high school teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

97
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just the kind of kid who took it.</v>

98
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:31.090
<v Speaker 1>If my English teacher said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read Moby Dick,</v>

99
00:04:31.091 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd go and read Moby Dick and if they</v>

100
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read Raymond Chandler,</v>

101
00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I Read Raymond Chandler because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hungry.</v>

102
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It was the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

103
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of kids do this with</v>

104
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:39.221
<v Speaker 1>music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

105
00:04:39.221 --> 00:04:39.971
<v Speaker 1>if your friend says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

106
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>you got to listen to King Crimson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>

107
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>you've got to listen to radio head or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

108
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll go out and listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was like that with,</v>

109
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>with books and that to me is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the one sign I think when I meet</v>

110
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:53.410
<v Speaker 1>a young writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if they read really</v>

111
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:54.800
<v Speaker 1>passionately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

112
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 1>that to me is the one mark of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

113
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.270
<v Speaker 1>you'll be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

114
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm always mystified when I meet writers</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

115
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to write,</v>

116
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>they have this urge to express</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

117
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want to read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't make sense.</v>
