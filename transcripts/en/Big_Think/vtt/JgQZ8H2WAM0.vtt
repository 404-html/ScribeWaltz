1
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>it's doable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from it and the language high</v>

3
00:00:14.321 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.960
<v Speaker 1>but we have had the phenomenon in Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>of feeding the nature.</v>

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Now Nietzsche is well known for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>death of God,</v>

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>nihilism and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forth</v>

7
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>and net next to each year we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dostoyevsky,</v>

8
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers Karamazov the idiot,</v>

9
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.220
<v Speaker 1>a crime or punishment has also for now</v>
<v Speaker 1>those two,</v>

10
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite different figures,</v>

11
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had something in common and this and</v>

12
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>that is that they realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realized all too well that</v>

13
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 2>MMM,</v>

14
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>if we lose the idea or the awareness</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>

15
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>the most important things in life have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intrinsic value,</v>

16
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:05.623
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

17
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>then you will create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you will get nihilism.</v>

18
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>If we don't understand what freedom is</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we think that freedom is equal to</v>

19
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>everything is permissible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When everything's become permissible,</v>

20
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>you get mass killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When things no longer half an intrinsic,</v>

21
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>intrinsic value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you don't fail you or your child</v>

22
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>because it is your child's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you fell you had because you think</v>

23
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>he will become a movie star or football</v>
<v Speaker 1>player or we'll do a lot of work for me.</v>

24
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can no longer,</v>

25
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell you decorate loft in your life</v>

26
00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>because you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:40.444
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be,</v>

28
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.130
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

29
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is the judge Gentek stupidity</v>

30
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

31
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>of a society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.580
<v Speaker 1>with this bombardments buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

33
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:52.181
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

34
00:01:52.181 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>buy mass media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

35
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>which is constantly lying to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's constantly lying to us.</v>

36
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to get first ID.</v>

37
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Trump for example.</v>

38
00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Trump is the incarnation of Mr</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kitsch.</v>

39
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.930
<v Speaker 1>And because you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he truly thinks that money is to</v>

40
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.580
<v Speaker 1>mode most important thing in alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you become a kitchen,</v>

41
00:02:13.581 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>like figure like he is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

42
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>you can make a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But look,</v>

43
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>every sound can tell you that raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing in money.</v>

44
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And this is what nihilism is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely nothing.</v>

45
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.640
<v Speaker 1>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I called the kitchen society.</v>

46
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.100
<v Speaker 1>We aim at a presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ignore the best.</v>

47
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.420
<v Speaker 1>We do not understand that the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>important things must have an intrinsic</v>

48
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

49
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was that there's,</v>

50
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 1>something's has to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to be a sacred and that,</v>

51
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the level of,</v>

53
00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.990
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of politics.</v>

54
00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

55
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Mr Karl Rove when he was still there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished.</v>

56
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect example of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

57
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>when politics is no longer the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>debate about the good society,</v>

58
00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>when politics is reduced to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>Surfing Bart Interest or surfing a self</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

60
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And to do it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to create a certain image like</v>

61
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

62
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 1>it worked for at least half a year that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the American people for</v>

63
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 1>mission accomplished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now in the meantime,</v>

64
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>they know the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there.</v>

65
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>So when the Kitsch Society is there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are constantly upheld with the fact,</v>

66
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

67
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.450
<v Speaker 1>education and education should be pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

68
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>Should focus on the useless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should try to make us,</v>

69
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware of,</v>

70
00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the masterpieces have to tell us,</v>

71
00:03:49.691 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>how to gain a certain wisdom in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then of course,</v>

72
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to develop your talents and you</v>

73
00:03:55.151 --> 00:04:00.151
<v Speaker 1>should follow your passion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for so long we are already living in</v>

74
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>a society in which wisdom is replaced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

75
00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:07.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how in which a history,</v>

76
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>according to Mr. Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>his bunk and all you have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious sects who are telling you</v>

78
00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:18.030
<v Speaker 1>there is only one truth and a 40 and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to obey and so on.</v>

79
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

80
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>are we surprised about what's happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our society?</v>

81
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Are we surprised about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh,</v>

82
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.160
<v Speaker 1>the sensors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ness,</v>

83
00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.800
<v Speaker 1>the killing or we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

84
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.190
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

85
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the interesting thing is that,</v>

86
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are still living in democracy.</v>

87
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not Russia,</v>

88
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>it's not Darfur or both places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are still living in a democracy.</v>

89
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:44.140
<v Speaker 1>And for God's sake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

90
00:04:44.141 --> 00:04:45.210
<v Speaker 1>you are American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>this is the country we'd start with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

92
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.130
<v Speaker 1>the people now we the people means one</v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple thing that is we are</v>

93
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 1>responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are responsible,</v>

94
00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>not those bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we stop watching television,</v>

95
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it will be immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't buy the product,</v>

96
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>the product will be gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you start by books,</v>

97
00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>bookshops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll return.</v>

98
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>Let's get rid of the lice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

99
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I that's also,</v>

100
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean what I hope you can contribute</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this disease.</v>

101
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>We have to get rid of the lies that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be very powerful.</v>

102
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are not very powerful.</v>

103
00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>And will it be addressed at chains?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>what would change in our society if</v>
<v Speaker 1>people still can do what they want to do</v>

105
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.710
<v Speaker 1>but they can no longer keep up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>

106
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.960
<v Speaker 1>They can no longer keep up the ID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

107
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>What I do is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore your interest or whatever,</v>

108
00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>we know you're lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still can do it,</v>

109
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.220
<v Speaker 1>but you're lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would make a difference.</v>

110
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.370
<v Speaker 1>And so we need a different mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to try to get back something,</v>

111
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:52.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our,</v>

112
00:05:52.771 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

113
00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>our cultural setting and starting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize again,</v>

114
00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:59.190
<v Speaker 1>what was the true questions are</v>

115
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.640
<v Speaker 3>democracy,</v>

116
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:12.070
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

117
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the good fix,</v>

118
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.860
<v Speaker 1>all the good things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the important things are that by</v>

119
00:06:20.861 --> 00:06:24.220
<v Speaker 1>definition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>filterable at fragile,</v>

120
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.100
<v Speaker 1>nothing can be taken for probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

121
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.250
<v Speaker 1>this is also European lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

122
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:38.251
<v Speaker 1>my mother was in one of the camps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was impossible for her to throw away</v>

123
00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:42.100
<v Speaker 1>one single piece of breads because she</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew what hunger was.</v>

124
00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:48.150
<v Speaker 1>That generation knows very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well still what freedom is and what</v>

125
00:06:49.931 --> 00:06:52.900
<v Speaker 1>happens to society when there is no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer freedom.</v>

126
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>They know what they are talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also know it's never a Giffen.</v>

127
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.680
<v Speaker 1>We don't have guarantees not alive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for our society.</v>

128
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.150
<v Speaker 1>So we know and we can even see it on</v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

129
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And if you also see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.970
<v Speaker 1>by what kind of forces we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>surrounded.</v>

131
00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is terrorism.</v>

132
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are people with a complete</v>

133
00:07:18.581 --> 00:07:21.610
<v Speaker 1>different mindset who believe in a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of holy law.</v>

134
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:23.990
<v Speaker 1>And so almost a fourth who want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>define it,</v>

135
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.520
<v Speaker 1>reduce the world to believe snow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievers and everybody in their</v>

136
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.820
<v Speaker 1>mindset is an unbelief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be an eagle lated and killed</v>

137
00:07:30.821 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

138
00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 1>it is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

139
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.380
<v Speaker 1>with economic power and so crazy by</v>
<v Speaker 1>their economic commercial power that he</v>

142
00:07:43.841 --> 00:07:47.350
<v Speaker 1>really wants to reduce everybody to</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers.</v>

143
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.390
<v Speaker 1>And if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:07:49.391 --> 00:07:54.220
<v Speaker 1>turn our society into a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>infantiles society that we all behave</v>

145
00:07:54.221 --> 00:07:58.590
<v Speaker 1>like stupid childs who wants this or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and,</v>

146
00:07:58.591 --> 00:08:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and can fight a certain satisfaction.</v>

147
00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Now for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long moment,</v>

148
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>we know the forces high there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that the best thing can Paris</v>

149
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.910
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very easily.</v>

150
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

151
00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:17.640
<v Speaker 1>being that the case and realizing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>what all those forces in their role for</v>

152
00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 1>variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what's a Sarepta and some are more</v>

153
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.920
<v Speaker 1>immediately frightening to our society</v>
<v Speaker 1>and orders are more threatening in,</v>

154
00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:26.800
<v Speaker 1>in a longterm.</v>

155
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:31.210
<v Speaker 1>But what they have in common is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they take away the quality of our life,</v>

156
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.540
<v Speaker 1>which could be on the level of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

157
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.630
<v Speaker 1>which could be on the level of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of our civil society,</v>

158
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 1>which could be on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

159
00:08:38.741 --> 00:08:39.371
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

160
00:08:39.371 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on one folf.</v>

161
00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.790
<v Speaker 1>But they take away the quality of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

162
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the ferry first thing to be done</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

163
00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:47.260
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking news,</v>

164
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:50.530
<v Speaker 1>let's do it right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is we have to rethink what is,</v>

165
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:54.520
<v Speaker 1>what's the meaning of the good society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

166
00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:59.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I once said to a friends,</v>

167
00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>and not that long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally had the opportunity to go to</v>

168
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Ellis island for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the very first time,</v>

169
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>a statue of liberty then to Ellis</v>
<v Speaker 1>island.</v>

170
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm a European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

171
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by your history.</v>

172
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by the people who came.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I came to Ellis Island,</v>

173
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>I saw this documentary with Gene</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hackman.</v>

174
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And you understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing the history of Europe,</v>

175
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 1>that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for so many people,</v>

176
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.040
<v Speaker 1>America by definition is if it's not the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good society,</v>

177
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the better society because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horror they had to face in Europe.</v>

178
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:36.030
<v Speaker 1>One guy's in this documentary says an</v>
<v Speaker 1>old man,</v>

179
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>the strange thing about America is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police is here to help you.</v>

181
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 1>They're also not the case in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was not the case in Poland.</v>

182
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>That was not the case in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I understand the kind of mindset in</v>

183
00:09:49.501 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>which Americans think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

184
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not the good society or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best societies,</v>

185
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:58.290
<v Speaker 1>but by far the better society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time itself,</v>

186
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>everybody now has to rethink once the</v>
<v Speaker 1>good society,</v>

187
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:07.440
<v Speaker 1>what are the quintessential values?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it that Europe and America have</v>

188
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:11.940
<v Speaker 1>in common?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how to defend those values in such a</v>

189
00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.270
<v Speaker 1>way that you are not a threat to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>

190
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the American dream worked</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everybody could realize,</v>

191
00:10:19.801 --> 00:10:21.330
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something in it for me</v>

192
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.300
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best,</v>

193
00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creators,</v>

194
00:10:25.611 --> 00:10:30.611
<v Speaker 1>the situation with it's globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with globalization in a sense of that,</v>

195
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.760
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that a lot of people have half the idea</v>

196
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:38.280
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that around identities are destructed</v>

197
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 1>because I don't want to sound like an</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti American but have the only coca</v>

198
00:10:44.141 --> 00:10:46.590
<v Speaker 1>cola and only a Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

199
00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the caricature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's how a lot of people</v>

200
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:50.970
<v Speaker 1>experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

201
00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 1>that's not the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's also not the as essence of</v>

202
00:10:54.841 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>the American dream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the good society,</v>

203
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:00.590
<v Speaker 1>what our quintessential fellows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then from there on,</v>

204
00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 1>what is it that we are doing with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>education?</v>

205
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.800
<v Speaker 1>How do we use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a media,</v>

206
00:11:04.801 --> 00:11:05.581
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our media,</v>

207
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 1>I no longer to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give information.</v>

208
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from it.</v>

209
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.100
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just one big commercial,</v>

210
00:11:11.130 --> 00:11:14.160
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thing as education has become a</v>

211
00:11:14.161 --> 00:11:16.720
<v Speaker 1>commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

213
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

214
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:20.310
<v Speaker 1>look at the politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

215
00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the both sides,</v>

216
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>on both,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the liberal side and the conservator,</v>

217
00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:29.130
<v Speaker 1>there was an enormous reductionism to</v>
<v Speaker 1>very simplistic concepts,</v>

218
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>which has nothing to do with a serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussion.</v>

219
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of work to be done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

220
00:11:34.441 --> 00:11:34.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

221
00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can do it.</v>

222
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:38.280
<v Speaker 1>And also we should win because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a choice.</v>
