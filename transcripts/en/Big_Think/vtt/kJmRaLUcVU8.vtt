1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>My name is Sherman Alexie and on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bantamweight champion of the world.</v>

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.741
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poet,</v>

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>short story writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novelist,</v>

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>screenwriter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're young bastard.</v>

6
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:20.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a strange dilemma because in some</v>

8
00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:25.734
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>I was very negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very native identified and I still am,</v>

10
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's almost become secondary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sort of joined the tribe of highly</v>

11
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>established literary writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

12
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm with Jonathan Franzen's of the</v>

13
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.753
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

15
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>I know I'm a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's sort of my peer group now</v>

16
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>rather than this sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>Indian world literary world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm now in this sort of</v>

18
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>make believe world of writers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly hang out a lot,</v>

19
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>although none of us ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in,</v>

20
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a community of riders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly successful literary writer is</v>

21
00:01:00.811 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

22
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I haven't changed anything I've written</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on all that stuff.</v>

24
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 1>So the perceptions of me may have</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed or the my career,</v>

25
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>but I'm still writing the same stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still pretty much about spokane,</v>

26
00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Indian males stumbling through live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

27
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because of the combination</v>

28
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 1>of skills I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>I work in multigenre is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do stand up comedy.</v>

31
00:01:28.651 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>I helped make movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think all of that has contributed to</v>

32
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just a novelist or not just a</v>

33
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>short story writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

34
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this highly technological world with</v>

35
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:45.591
<v Speaker 1>many diverse and diffuse influences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm able to hit a lot of bases.</v>

36
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Nobody who's ever been poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

37
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>use the phrase selling out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.063
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

40
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:57.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:57.571 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>my influences and the genre artists come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from my Indian writing ancestors,</v>

42
00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>the previous generation when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking James Welch,</v>

43
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Simon Artese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Momaday,</v>

44
00:02:07.411 --> 00:02:09.300
<v Speaker 1>joy Harjo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leslie Silko,</v>

45
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Linda Hogan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adrian St Louis,</v>

46
00:02:11.851 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>all of these writers were multigenre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all wrote poetry and novels and</v>

47
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>short stories and nonfiction and dabbled</v>
<v Speaker 1>in song writing and filmmaking and</v>

48
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>documentary making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my original influences were native</v>

49
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.330
<v Speaker 1>American multigenre artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.520
<v Speaker 1>now these days the younger native</v>
<v Speaker 1>writers are not multigenre.</v>

51
00:02:32.521 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what's happening,</v>

52
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>why that has changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I grew up as a kid writer.</v>

53
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody ever told me I was supposed to be</v>

54
00:02:41.281 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just because I've happened to become</v>

55
00:02:44.461 --> 00:02:49.230
<v Speaker 1>successful in a number of those genres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't because I was pursuing them</v>

56
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was because I saw the artistic</v>

57
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 1>possibilities in all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was taught that was when I was a</v>

58
00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>19 year old undergraduate.</v>

59
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm the least educated Indian</v>

60
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.270
<v Speaker 1>writer out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

62
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>I've taught at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington,</v>

63
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not a good teacher.</v>

64
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>So I think that probably disqualifies</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

65
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

66
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in academia at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.640
<v Speaker 1>in terms of a full time career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's interesting because I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at native American</v>

69
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to find that it doesn't</v>

70
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>really reflect the diversity of the ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which the writers actually live their</v>

71
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody has ever written,</v>

72
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:34.770
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in academic farce,</v>

73
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.520
<v Speaker 1>a native American teacher at college</v>
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>

74
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.040
<v Speaker 1>which is a time honored and wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>genre.</v>

75
00:03:40.041 --> 00:03:42.250
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Lodge made a whole career out of</v>

76
00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing economic forces.</v>

77
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:44.891
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every writer you can name as written it,</v>

79
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>but we haven't done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas that novel about that Indian</v>

81
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>architect or that Indian lawyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a distinct lack of white collar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>native American literature,</v>

83
00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that most of it's most</v>
<v Speaker 1>visible practitioners are white collar</v>

84
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

85
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's an effort,</v>

86
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 1>a somewhat of an insecurity that to</v>
<v Speaker 1>prove your indianness by focusing almost</v>

87
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>entirely on our reservation based</v>
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>

88
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's old fashioned actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

89
00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>I think people think it's something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of being a storyteller,</v>

90
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for most of our existence was not</v>

91
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>related to books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was about the ability to stand up in</v>

92
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>front of the fire and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.140
<v Speaker 1>earn your supper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

94
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>so I think it's just something old and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspired in me,</v>

95
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>but I never really was the funny guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>

96
00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>If you'd asked my siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tell you I was the depressed guy in</v>

97
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>the basement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

98
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there the funny ones,</v>

99
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.780
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got on stage and started talking and</v>

101
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.610
<v Speaker 1>people laughed at the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even necessarily know what was</v>

102
00:04:54.611 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 1>but as the years have gone on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realized that a humorous,</v>

104
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>pretty amazing in its ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>transcend differences politically,</v>

105
00:05:04.691 --> 00:05:06.070
<v Speaker 1>ethnically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racially,</v>

106
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>geographically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically.</v>

107
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about it that really</v>

108
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>opens people up spiritually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

109
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And they listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pay attention and it's also a great</v>

110
00:05:16.961 --> 00:05:18.880
<v Speaker 1>way to offend people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

111
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all been to literary readings,</v>

112
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we got theater but so bored by the</v>

113
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:30.070
<v Speaker 1>person up in front of us reading their</v>
<v Speaker 1>work so dispassionately that it nearly</v>

114
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:32.400
<v Speaker 1>turns us off their books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

115
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are writers who I've heard do</v>

116
00:05:35.141 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 1>their work that I could only hear their</v>
<v Speaker 1>voice when I'm reading their books and</v>

117
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.770
<v Speaker 1>it's so disinterested in their own stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just never wanted to do that.</v>

118
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to make the mistake the other</v>

119
00:05:46.421 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm pleased when somebody is offended by</v>
<v Speaker 1>my large stage presence because there's</v>

121
00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>still people who show up will get</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended.</v>

122
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get up there and give a show and I'm</v>

123
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>improvising and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>talking about current events and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened yesterday or what happened an</v>

125
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>hour ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened five minutes before I</v>

126
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:07.820
<v Speaker 1>walked into the place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:06:07.821 --> 00:06:10.480
<v Speaker 1>and giving people a glimpse of how my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 1>crazy mind works and then they'll come</v>
<v Speaker 1>up after me and said,</v>

129
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really disappointed you didn't read</v>

130
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:16.724
<v Speaker 1>the story.</v>

131
00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you look at them and think,</v>

132
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read this story.</v>

133
00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened tonight will only happen</v>

134
00:06:22.791 --> 00:06:23.530
<v Speaker 1>once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

135
00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.550
<v Speaker 1>you were here for one time thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

136
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>so I guess people are trapped in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions of what a literary artist is</v>

137
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be.</v>

138
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.671
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>I write poems naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing them all the time.</v>

140
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's more of a reflex talent</v>
<v Speaker 1>than fiction is for me.</v>

141
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It seems like I have to work harder to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write fiction.</v>

142
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sad poems are much more demanding.</v>

143
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>You have fewer words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make fewer mistakes.</v>

144
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you write a 10 line poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can't make any mistakes.</v>

145
00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poem is terrible.</v>

146
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you write a novel,</v>

147
00:07:00.111 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>you have all that space to mess up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are more forgiving.</v>

148
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I think poetry audiences are far more</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding than fiction and audiences are</v>

150
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.910
<v Speaker 1>writers generally come in two groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who love what they do and those</v>

152
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:19.260
<v Speaker 1>who can't stand what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

153
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>in the second group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a really difficult time looking</v>

154
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

155
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I figure out of the thousands of</v>

156
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>pages I published,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably about 100 great pages.</v>

157
00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I think I worked on probably about a two</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent greatness rate.</v>

158
00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's probably 10 poems to stories</v>

159
00:07:38.901 --> 00:07:43.901
<v Speaker 1>that are great and the rest of it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>from anywhere from pretty good to know</v>

160
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.900
<v Speaker 1>total crap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:07:47.901 --> 00:07:52.901
<v Speaker 1>the book is not played out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of what a book can be is not</v>

162
00:07:53.091 --> 00:07:56.940
<v Speaker 1>played out in its form as it is with</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper and covers and um,</v>

163
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.130
<v Speaker 1>and there are things that can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that digital will never touch.</v>

164
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with this,</v>

165
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and comparing it to a cassette tape,</v>

166
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>the old fashioned way of making a mix</v>
<v Speaker 1>tape,</v>

167
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.010
<v Speaker 1>I love burning cds too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something far more</v>

169
00:08:13.011 --> 00:08:17.540
<v Speaker 1>passionate and hands on and hard work</v>
<v Speaker 1>about making a mix tape on a cassette.</v>

170
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.610
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's too easy to revise with a CD.</v>

171
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.450
<v Speaker 1>And today's technology makes it too easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

172
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.940
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change immediately.</v>

173
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:32.080
<v Speaker 1>You can cover your mistakes quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

174
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.013
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

175
00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>I think it allows you to have this sheen</v>
<v Speaker 1>of perfection around yourself,</v>

176
00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with,</v>

177
00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an old fashioned book or an old</v>

178
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>fashioned cassette tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can actually see all the flaws and</v>

179
00:08:44.541 --> 00:08:47.760
<v Speaker 1>imperfections and the bad choices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

180
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.760
<v Speaker 1>and I think there's something we lose</v>
<v Speaker 1>with technology when you talk about bad</v>

181
00:08:52.761 --> 00:08:53.594
<v Speaker 1>choices.</v>

182
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:58.290
<v Speaker 1>They cost $300.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

183
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anything that costs $300</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be called the gala perion.</v>

184
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

185
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>how much of the world can afford a $300</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading device?</v>

186
00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:12.010
<v Speaker 1>A one percent of one percent of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent that automatically qualifies for</v>

187
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.950
<v Speaker 1>economically elite status.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

188
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:15.950
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

189
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>what's really going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reading public doesn't really know</v>

190
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>about all they're concerned about and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all their defending is they're reading</v>

191
00:09:21.481 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 1>convenience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I completely understand whether</v>

192
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>it's because of physical disability or</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of personal preference or just</v>

193
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>the newness of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why they love a digital book,</v>

194
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:34.350
<v Speaker 1>but they don't understand the economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate pressures going on in the</v>

195
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>publishing world and what's going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

196
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>And this is going to happen on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet to,</v>

197
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:41.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to pretend that the internet is</v>

198
00:09:41.161 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

199
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we like to pretend it's an open source</v>

200
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

201
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.190
<v Speaker 1>But as culture changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as corporate,</v>

202
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>old corporate models of distributing</v>
<v Speaker 1>information are changing,</v>

203
00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why people assumed that</v>

204
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:57.360
<v Speaker 1>corporations aren't going to take over</v>
<v Speaker 1>this medium as well because they can.</v>

205
00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.531
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

206
00:09:58.531 --> 00:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

207
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>so what's happening in the book world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the digital books,</v>

208
00:10:03.151 --> 00:10:05.580
<v Speaker 1>is that these ebook companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

209
00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barnes and noble,</v>

210
00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>others that are rising a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just don't seek to published books.</v>

211
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>They're going to end up seeking the</v>
<v Speaker 1>books to be chosen to be published.</v>

212
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.170
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

213
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.120
<v Speaker 1>this economic model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's set up now is going to</v>

214
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:26.121
<v Speaker 1>favor a certain kind of book a and</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishers and being economically</v>

215
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 1>motivated companies are only going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishing those kinds of books and the</v>

216
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:37.521
<v Speaker 1>divide between pop culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pop writing and literary writing.</v>

217
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Is this going to increase and increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>and increase and it's gonna make it</v>

218
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>harder and harder and harder for first</v>
<v Speaker 1>time writers to get published in any</v>

219
00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:46.770
<v Speaker 1>form whatsoever where they'll get</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

220
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.680
<v Speaker 1>who can find you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

221
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.150
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's gonna find anybody.</v>

222
00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's really risen out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet to become a major voice.</v>

223
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they always end up getting a book</v>

224
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 1>published and then the book makes them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>major voice.</v>

225
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody has.</v>

226
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

227
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

228
00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not Internet averse at all.</v>

229
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

230
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean I love the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is,</v>

231
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>is that it's a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>

232
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:20.220
<v Speaker 1>unfiltered library which has the</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and beauty,</v>

233
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.150
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's impossible to find people and</v>

234
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we end up doing anyways,</v>

235
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:29.630
<v Speaker 1>I go to about five sites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

236
00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:31.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think most people probably do the</v>

237
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You create this little small town inside</v>

238
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:39.180
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and we end up in all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>little tiny separate communities.</v>

239
00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joan Jett and interviewed Joan Jett,</v>

240
00:11:41.971 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 1>she said about the music industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

241
00:11:44.191 --> 00:11:46.200
<v Speaker 1>the thing that's missing now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>anticipation.</v>

242
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:50.520
<v Speaker 1>They said that nobody gets an a big line</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of tower records anymore waiting</v>

243
00:11:50.521 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>for that new stones album to drop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And nobody stands in line outside of a</v>

244
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.030
<v Speaker 1>record store waiting to buy the tickets</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the WHO concert.</v>

245
00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.210
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a real lack of community on the</v>

246
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.240
<v Speaker 1>internet experience when it comes to art</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can't tell me and it's not true</v>

247
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>that communicating strictly through the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet forums community and the way</v>

248
00:12:11.351 --> 00:12:15.280
<v Speaker 1>that being together does a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're missing all.</v>

249
00:12:15.281 --> 00:12:18.880
<v Speaker 1>But one sense you don't smell paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really hear them,</v>

250
00:12:18.881 --> 00:12:20.530
<v Speaker 1>you don't see him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

251
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:24.220
<v Speaker 1>and we're animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're creatures of senses and the</v>

252
00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Internet deprives you of many of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

253
00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:27.634
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

254
00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

255
00:12:29.621 --> 00:12:32.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's new art coming based on</v>

256
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:34.870
<v Speaker 1>this technology and some of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening and it's exciting and</v>

257
00:12:34.871 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nothing wrong with the old</v>

258
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:42.511
<v Speaker 1>art and I always worry and you see it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with certain Internet folks,</v>

259
00:12:42.521 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 1>the way in which they're completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to jettison their past in the</v>

260
00:12:46.961 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I'm worried about.</v>

261
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to write about the emotional</v>

262
00:12:54.461 --> 00:12:57.040
<v Speaker 1>state of a character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to get as close as possible to</v>

263
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:01.300
<v Speaker 1>being in that emotional state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I have to get that sad.</v>

264
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I have to get that happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that crazed,</v>

265
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>that bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obsessed,</v>

266
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever one of my characters are going</v>

267
00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to find my way into it.</v>

268
00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.730
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

269
00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.170
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the way I do it.</v>

270
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.750
<v Speaker 1>There's a story in this book called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ballad of Paul nonetheless,</v>

271
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:24.751
<v Speaker 1>where he becomes so obsessed with pop</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and so obsessed with his ipod and</v>

272
00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.333
<v Speaker 1>that he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

273
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:28.183
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

274
00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.300
<v Speaker 1>every thought he has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this can become directly related to a</v>

275
00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went that far into it.</v>

276
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to talk only in song lyrics.</v>

277
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 1>whenever anybody was talking to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I drove my friends and family mad</v>

279
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.190
<v Speaker 1>because whenever they would talk to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

280
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.711
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

281
00:13:44.711 --> 00:13:46.230
<v Speaker 1>that reminds me of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

282
00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:50.020
<v Speaker 1>a rolling stones song or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whenever anybody said something</v>

283
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.660
<v Speaker 1>accidentally that was a lyric or a title</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a song,</v>

284
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I would then sing the song.</v>

285
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.400
<v Speaker 1>So it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it got me seeing the way it was</v>

286
00:14:00.551 --> 00:14:03.940
<v Speaker 1>completely alienating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends and family really got me to a</v>

287
00:14:03.941 --> 00:14:08.030
<v Speaker 1>place where I could write that story</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this really genial guy who's</v>

288
00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:13.050
<v Speaker 1>actually very much an anti hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a case of beer a day.</v>

289
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:17.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

290
00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:20.730
<v Speaker 1>I could drink a fifth of Tequila a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

291
00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a drinking problem when it</v>

292
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 1>affects your relationships with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.500
<v Speaker 1>when it affects your job or your school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your grade point average,</v>

294
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:31.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:33.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affects your,</v>

296
00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:36.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a drinking problem when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting on your couch at home,</v>

297
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:40.480
<v Speaker 1>drinking a case of beer all by yourself</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you pass out and grabbed the</v>

298
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:44.410
<v Speaker 1>fifth of Tequila when you wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's pretty obvious what my problem</v>

299
00:14:44.411 --> 00:14:45.244
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

300
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.320
<v Speaker 1>I wrote the lone ranger and Tonto</v>
<v Speaker 1>fistfight in heaven and the business of</v>

301
00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:53.930
<v Speaker 1>fancy dancing a while drunk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking.</v>

302
00:14:53.931 --> 00:14:55.060
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:55.470
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

304
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:58.610
<v Speaker 1>there's certainly a lot to be said for</v>
<v Speaker 1>my desperate years.</v>

305
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.640
<v Speaker 1>My Alcoholic Year is my active alcoholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>years as being the source of some pretty</v>

306
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>good work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

307
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.660
<v Speaker 1>for being the source of the two books</v>
<v Speaker 1>that established and made my career.</v>

308
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>

309
00:15:09.981 --> 00:15:12.440
<v Speaker 1>it's unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

310
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are using substances to feel your</v>

311
00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:17.950
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

312
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very short artistic life.</v>

313
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:23.870
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be a sprinter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

314
00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.680
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

315
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:29.000
<v Speaker 1>by and large I wanted to become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon runner and I can only run the</v>

316
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:31.490
<v Speaker 1>marathon if I'm sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Kill Your brain,</v>

317
00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

318
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:37.690
<v Speaker 1>please try to find me the successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug user,</v>

319
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

320
00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.590
<v Speaker 1>try to find me the high functioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>

321
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>career person,</v>

322
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could probably find in their</v>

323
00:15:47.691 --> 00:15:51.180
<v Speaker 1>work when they were drinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were a,</v>

324
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:56.430
<v Speaker 1>I bet you could look at the downfall of</v>
<v Speaker 1>some amazing writers who wrote a one or</v>

325
00:15:56.431 --> 00:15:58.220
<v Speaker 1>two great books and then just fell</v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

326
00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that's a related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol consumption.</v>

327
00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's unsustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

328
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the environment,</v>

329
00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can only pour so much pollutants</v>

330
00:16:09.831 --> 00:16:12.740
<v Speaker 1>into it before the temperature changes</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically.</v>

331
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 1>So I think a drug and alcohol abuse is</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the greenhouse effect for riders.</v>

332
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:20.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

333
00:16:20.901 --> 00:16:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm an alcoholic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

334
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family is filled with alcohol</v>

335
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:27.150
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My tribe is filled with alcoholics.</v>

336
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:29.120
<v Speaker 1>The whole race is filled with</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcoholics.</v>

337
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:31.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those Indians who try to pretend</v>

338
00:16:31.851 --> 00:16:33.620
<v Speaker 1>it's a stereotype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in deep,</v>

339
00:16:33.621 --> 00:16:35.080
<v Speaker 1>deep denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

340
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:40.510
<v Speaker 1>it's an everyday part of my life and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a writer I use that a to write about it,</v>

341
00:16:41.991 --> 00:16:44.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly for fictional purposes and</v>

342
00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 1>narrative purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly what the social hope that by</v>

343
00:16:47.241 --> 00:16:50.750
<v Speaker 1>writing about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it'll help people get sober and it</v>

344
00:16:50.751 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard from them,</v>

345
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

346
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.150
<v Speaker 1>the social function of art is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to me.</v>

347
00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just for art's sake.</v>

348
00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a very specific,</v>

349
00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 1>very specific ideas in mind about what</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can do.</v>

350
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:08.771
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it is writing about alcohol that</v>

351
00:17:08.991 --> 00:17:11.010
<v Speaker 1>helps me stay sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

352
00:17:11.210 --> 00:17:14.510
<v Speaker 1>and I think reading about alcoholism</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps other people stay sober.</v>

353
00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I try to meet deadlines</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

354
00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>more dependence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

356
00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:24.980
<v Speaker 1>so it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

357
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:29.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basic triangle needs that bottom part of</v>

358
00:17:29.361 --> 00:17:30.470
<v Speaker 1>the triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

359
00:17:30.471 --> 00:17:32.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they're always surprising me.</v>

360
00:17:32.661 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>The kids are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I surprisingly,</v>

361
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:37.340
<v Speaker 1>if their insights into the world and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course because they're my children,</v>

362
00:17:37.341 --> 00:17:38.930
<v Speaker 1>I pay more attention to what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

363
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Then pretty much everybody else on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

364
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I care more what my kids say on a daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

365
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:44.811
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

366
00:17:44.811 --> 00:17:47.070
<v Speaker 1>the smartest people on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.480
<v Speaker 1>and so I listened and their insights are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really surprising and the way in which,</v>

368
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.740
<v Speaker 1>how unfiltered they are and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

369
00:17:57.741 --> 00:18:00.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their obsessions and passions,</v>

370
00:18:00.061 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 1>they don't apologize for any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I learned a lot from them.</v>

371
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.150
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also aggravating and irritating and</v>

372
00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.470
<v Speaker 1>exhausting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

373
00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:10.590
<v Speaker 1>the sacrifices you make and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.320
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it feels like my whole life as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a to do list.</v>

375
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:14.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

376
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:15.773
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

377
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think their passion for life really as</v>

378
00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.840
<v Speaker 1>reinspired me.</v>

379
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:28.240
<v Speaker 1>No I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

380
00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.540
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're autonomous.</v>

381
00:18:29.541 --> 00:18:32.090
<v Speaker 1>I certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they want to read my stuff and talk</v>

382
00:18:32.091 --> 00:18:33.410
<v Speaker 1>about it later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be great.</v>

383
00:18:33.411 --> 00:18:35.060
<v Speaker 1>But until then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

384
00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it was so funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was profiled on the layer news hour</v>

385
00:18:39.381 --> 00:18:43.640
<v Speaker 1>recently and I was watching the rough</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut of it and my son came down,</v>

386
00:18:43.641 --> 00:18:46.430
<v Speaker 1>my eight year old and he was watching it</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the TV with me and it was a five</v>

387
00:18:46.431 --> 00:18:49.970
<v Speaker 1>minute piece about poetry and I read a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple poems and I read one very</v>

388
00:18:49.971 --> 00:18:52.910
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my father's death and it was over</v>

389
00:18:52.911 --> 00:18:54.590
<v Speaker 1>and my son looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's eight years old.</v>

390
00:18:54.591 --> 00:18:55.424
<v Speaker 1>They looked at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

391
00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pretty good.</v>

392
00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:05.360
<v Speaker 1>So that was a great moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's funny.</v>

393
00:19:05.361 --> 00:19:07.280
<v Speaker 1>This popped into my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll go with it.</v>

394
00:19:07.281 --> 00:19:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Shoeless Joe Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

395
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.920
<v Speaker 1>who was banned from baseball in 1919 for</v>
<v Speaker 1>allegedly fixing the world series a</v>

396
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:19.880
<v Speaker 1>country boy ended up being a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>baseball player,</v>

397
00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:23.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to talk to them about that</v>

398
00:19:23.511 --> 00:19:26.990
<v Speaker 1>world series about the mysteries of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human nature because,</v>

399
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at the stats.</v>

400
00:19:29.290 --> 00:19:32.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure he didn't participate in</v>

401
00:19:32.811 --> 00:19:34.100
<v Speaker 1>the fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he knew about it.</v>

402
00:19:34.101 --> 00:19:36.500
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to have the discussion with</v>
<v Speaker 1>morality,</v>

403
00:19:36.501 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 1>which she will list Joe Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

404
00:19:41.151 --> 00:19:44.540
<v Speaker 1>there are just certain poems and novels</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stories that resonate forever and</v>

405
00:19:44.541 --> 00:19:45.610
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

406
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poems.</v>

407
00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 1>I always return to Emily Dickinson</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I could not stop for death that</v>

408
00:19:50.961 --> 00:19:52.220
<v Speaker 1>kindly stopped for me.</v>

409
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.320
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no</v>

410
00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Speaker 1>theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhett keys.</v>

411
00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I know a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

412
00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.360
<v Speaker 1>I knew a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lovely later bones when small birds side</v>

413
00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.713
<v Speaker 3>back at them,</v>

414
00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.403
<v Speaker 1>James,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

415
00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly I realized that if I stepped</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside my body,</v>

416
00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I would break into blossom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

417
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:13.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

418
00:20:13.691 --> 00:20:14.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

419
00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:16.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of Grapes of Wrath when Rosa,</v>

420
00:20:16.811 --> 00:20:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Sharon breastfeeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her child has died,</v>

421
00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:22.600
<v Speaker 1>but she breastfeeds to starving man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That moment.</v>

422
00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's always individual works.</v>

423
00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in life I don't,</v>

424
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:33.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't have heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in heroic ideas because the</v>

425
00:20:33.461 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 1>creators of all those ideas are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

426
00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you make heroes out of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you invariably be disappointed</v>

427
00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:46.350
<v Speaker 1>as her Jack Keats a snowy day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book,</v>

428
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of multicultural literature is</v>

429
00:20:49.781 --> 00:20:53.290
<v Speaker 1>very new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so as a little Indian boy growing up</v>

430
00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.930
<v Speaker 1>on the reservation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was nobody like me in the books.</v>

431
00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:00.250
<v Speaker 1>So you always had to extrapolate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I picked up a snowy day with</v>

432
00:21:00.251 --> 00:21:05.251
<v Speaker 1>that inner city Black Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that child walking through the snow</v>

433
00:21:05.501 --> 00:21:09.220
<v Speaker 1>covered pretty quiet and lonely city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

434
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was making snow angels and you</v>

435
00:21:12.051 --> 00:21:14.020
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he was getting a snowball fights</v>

436
00:21:14.021 --> 00:21:16.090
<v Speaker 1>and when he got home to his mother and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was cold,</v>

437
00:21:16.091 --> 00:21:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and if you put them in a hot bath tub</v>
<v Speaker 1>and put them to sleep,</v>

438
00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 1>the loneliness and the love in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>

439
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just gorgeous.</v>

440
00:21:23.771 --> 00:21:27.190
<v Speaker 1>So that picture book resonates with me</v>
<v Speaker 1>still.</v>
