00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really are very few countries left</v>

2
00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 1>in the world that are capable of adding</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the world supply of oil.</v>

3
00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Most of the oil producers now are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>decline,</v>

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>so that handful of countries that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to increase oil are Azerbaijan and</v>

5
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:29.351
<v Speaker 1>Kazakhstan and the Caspian Sea area may</v>
<v Speaker 1>be Iraq in the Persian Gulf.</v>

6
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:36.731
<v Speaker 1>And we know what problems are faced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and then Africa,</v>

7
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Algeria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya,</v>

8
00:00:39.471 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Sudan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Gola,</v>

9
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Equatorial Guinea and Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not too many other countries really</v>

10
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>may be Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Columbia,</v>

11
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 2>but that's about it.</v>
