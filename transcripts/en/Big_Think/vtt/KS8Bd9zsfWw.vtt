1
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.200
<v Speaker 1>Well I think you can really trace it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to at least the 1960s,</v>

2
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>if not earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>what we started to see going on in</v>
<v Speaker 1>American politics in the 1960s and</v>

4
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>continuing into the seventies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties was really the disintegration</v>

5
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>of the old new deal coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>and alignment that had been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.020
<v Speaker 1>kind of put together by Franklin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt and that sustained the</v>

8
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party as the dominant party</v>
<v Speaker 1>in American politics for many years.</v>

9
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that coalition consisted of a number of</v>

10
00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.180
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>such as white southerners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>northern white ethnic voters,</v>

12
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>and white working class voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 1>inherently had a little in common with</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

15
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>particularly when you add in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>the growing representation of African</v>
<v Speaker 1>American voters after the 1960s with the</v>

17
00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:00.190
<v Speaker 1>voting rights act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>so there's coalition was sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently unstable.</v>

19
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:06.350
<v Speaker 1>And what we began to see in the 1960s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:11.351
<v Speaker 1>especially after the passage of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting rights act and the growth of the</v>

21
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>African American electorate was that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the more conservative elements in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>coalition,</v>

23
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>particularly white southerners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>

24
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative white ethnic voters,</v>

25
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to move,</v>

26
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the Republicans.</v>

27
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had an ideological realignment that</v>

28
00:01:31.461 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen overnight.</v>

29
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not something that occurred in</v>

30
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:38.120
<v Speaker 1>the single election or a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

31
00:01:38.121 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>It was something that took place over</v>
<v Speaker 1>several decades,</v>

32
00:01:40.611 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:46.871
<v Speaker 1>but we gradually began to see these more</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative voters moving away from the</v>

34
00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and into the Republican camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:49.881 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>and on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in response to that,</v>

36
00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more moderate to liberal voters,</v>

37
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had been aligned with the</v>

38
00:01:57.291 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in parts of the country where</v>

39
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>you had a moderate to liberal</v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans like the northeast,</v>

40
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they began to move away from the</v>

41
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Republicans and toward the Democrats as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican party became increasingly</v>

42
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can see this beginning with</v>

43
00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon southern strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>in 1972,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>and continuing with Ronald Reagan's</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential campaigns.</v>

46
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 1>And then certainly in the 1990s with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>takeover of the Republican Party in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress by I'm more conservative group</v>

49
00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>of leaders led by Newt Gingrich.</v>

50
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>So essentially what was happening here</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>

51
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the elite level,</v>

52
00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>we were seeing increasing ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization and that change began to,</v>

53
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect the loyalties of the voters,</v>

54
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and increasingly over time.</v>

55
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.750
<v Speaker 1>And by the time we got to the 1990s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it had reached the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

57
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>old democratic coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:09.570
<v Speaker 1>and the Democratic dominance of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least congress was no longer no</v>

60
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>longer existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's really continued even up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>present time.</v>

62
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else that's been happening a</v>

63
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>over this entire time period and</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with the last couple of</v>

64
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.170
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also playing into this has been,</v>

65
00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demographic changes taking place in</v>

66
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:33.730
<v Speaker 1>the electric and the growing diversity</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the American Electric,</v>

67
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where non white voters are becoming a</v>

68
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger share of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>electorate.</v>

69
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and particularly of the Democratic</v>

70
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that by 2008,</v>

71
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the contributions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different racial and ethnic groups to</v>

72
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>the party coalitions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that,</v>

73
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nonwhites made up over 40% of democratic</v>

74
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:00.274
<v Speaker 1>voters.</v>

75
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas,</v>

76
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non whites were only about seven or 8%</v>

77
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.400
<v Speaker 1>of Republican voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:04:09.401 --> 00:04:11.770
<v Speaker 1>so this is growing divergence between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties,</v>

79
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>both in terms of their racial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic,</v>

80
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups that support the parties.</v>

81
00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:22.510
<v Speaker 1>And also in terms of ideology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

82
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>it's the more engaged segment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public that really becomes increasingly</v>

83
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:36.631
<v Speaker 1>polarized because they're the ones who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really following these debates,</v>

84
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>who are really attentive to what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the congress to the</v>

85
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>positions of the parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

86
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.670
<v Speaker 1>and so they tend to react much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly than people who are just not,</v>

87
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention.</v>

88
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>But what happens over time is that even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though this process of realignment</v>

89
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.200
<v Speaker 1>really was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

90
00:04:56.201 --> 00:05:00.730
<v Speaker 1>initiated by political elites for</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic reasons.</v>

91
00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:05.020
<v Speaker 1>So you had Republican politicians in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular who I think saw opportunities</v>

92
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:09.880
<v Speaker 1>to win over some of these voting groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been traditionally supporting</v>

93
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:10.714
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats.</v>

94
00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once the public,</v>

95
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least the attentive segment of the</v>

96
00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:21.091
<v Speaker 1>public becomes polarized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in turn sort of starts to constrain</v>

97
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the positions of political elites</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

98
00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And now they have to reflect the views</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the voters who make up their,</v>

99
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own base.</v>

100
00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.420
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're seeing today is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotten to the point where the party</v>

101
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 1>leaders and candidates for office are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really kind of constrained to a large</v>

102
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:47.491
<v Speaker 1>degree by the polarization that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the attentive public.</v>

103
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:48.520
<v Speaker 1>So if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

104
00:05:48.521 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>at primary voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that,</v>

105
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican primary voters are really</v>

106
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>quite conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By enlarge democratic primary voters</v>

107
00:05:55.751 --> 00:06:00.751
<v Speaker 1>tend to be a fairly liberal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore candidates who want to be</v>

108
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.920
<v Speaker 1>successful in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:06:04.921 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Speaker 1>have to appeal to these primary voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

110
00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more and more congressional</v>

111
00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:17.501
<v Speaker 1>districts and even states where one</v>
<v Speaker 1>party is dominant and therefore the key</v>

112
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:23.411
<v Speaker 1>to success in those types of districts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those types of states is,</v>

113
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.080
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just to appeal to the party base and</v>

114
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 1>there's less need to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to voters,</v>

115
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the other party.</v>

116
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:36.341
<v Speaker 1>So political campaigns have become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>about mobilizing the base then about</v>

117
00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.730
<v Speaker 1>appealing to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>swing voters in the middle.</v>

119
00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
