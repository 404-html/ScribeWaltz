<v Speaker 1>It's really weird because I write for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this high culture magazine in all</v>

2
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:17.680
<v Speaker 1>of my great original influences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like low culture.</v>

3
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

4
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I love Fitzgerald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>

5
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>love,</v>

6
00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>love fits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

8
00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:24.850
<v Speaker 1>I love the New Yorker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.390
<v Speaker 1>I love all these high culture things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first things that taught me</v>

10
00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:32.290
<v Speaker 1>about how words were beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like hip hop and dungeons and</v>

11
00:00:32.291 --> 00:00:36.730
<v Speaker 1>dragons and I can't remember a taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>dungeons and dragons has all these.</v>

12
00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm about to get real nerdy on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope you're ready for this.</v>

13
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>They're using dragon says all these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these great books.</v>

14
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so like I can remember taking one of</v>

15
00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Speaker 1>the books is the monsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

16
00:00:44.931 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>You went into the list of all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological monsters that inhabit a</v>

17
00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:51.550
<v Speaker 1>world of Greyhawk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of dungeons and dragons.</v>

18
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>And I can remember just sitting back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>flipping through and looking at the</v>

19
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>words and the descriptions and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would come alive for me.</v>

20
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And that was a beautiful thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the first lesson for me</v>

21
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.320
<v Speaker 1>about how words can take you somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>else and a hip hop was the first lesson</v>

22
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>in terms of how words are beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.360
<v Speaker 1>my parents were very much in the books</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>

24
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>I read a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly as a kid,</v>

25
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of people talking in the</v>

26
00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kids speak in a,</v>

27
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>someone speaking in the slang of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

28
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I heard something like a rock him</v>

29
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>follow the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says I could take a phrase that's</v>

30
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>rarely heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flip it,</v>

31
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.670
<v Speaker 1>and now it's a daily word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was like,</v>

32
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.241
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

33
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was beautiful.</v>

34
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>That was beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I desperately wanted to do something</v>

35
00:01:45.241 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>that beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

36
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't the sort of thing that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought it was beautiful because someone</v>

37
00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>told you it was beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you felt it.</v>

38
00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>It was a feeling like here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

39
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.430
<v Speaker 1>and of course all your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of your friends felt it too.</v>

40
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>But</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things later I,</v>

41
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I later in college I studied poetry,</v>

42
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:09.790
<v Speaker 1>which is also a huge influence on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I had to learn why poetry was</v>

43
00:02:09.791 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

44
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.110
<v Speaker 1>I really did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn why art was beautiful.</v>

45
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to learn why certain music was</v>

46
00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 1>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's true for certain aspects of</v>

48
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:21.320
<v Speaker 1>hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a,</v>

49
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>for a lot of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it touched on such a visceral level.</v>

50
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>I desperately wanted to create something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that did that.</v>

51
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.450
<v Speaker 2>Still do.</v>
