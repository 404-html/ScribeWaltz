00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>A large percentage of what people will</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to something is sometimes</v>

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>it's as much a donation in support of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship as it is a donation in</v>

3
00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:16.581
<v Speaker 1>support of a cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we wanted to be sure to do was make</v>

4
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:21.711
<v Speaker 1>sure that for the motivated person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a target and a goal that that what</v>

5
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:28.191
<v Speaker 1>we were engineering was an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>toolbox for them to use all of our best</v>

6
00:00:28.861 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>ideas that we've ever had and even to</v>
<v Speaker 1>source from other people by surfing</v>

7
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>around in the site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective ways of taking their</v>

8
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>motivation and their energy and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

9
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>leveraging it into really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity in terms of their personal</v>

10
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 1>fundraising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand you want to supply</v>

11
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:52.140
<v Speaker 1>the motivated person with everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to do a really good job.</v>

12
00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.700
<v Speaker 1>The next ring out is people who might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not have a specific connection.</v>

13
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.790
<v Speaker 1>So for organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think one of the things that's really</v>

14
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>potent is the idea of in some ways doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Obama did,</v>

15
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:09.081
<v Speaker 1>which is take people who are already</v>
<v Speaker 1>donors to you and turn them into small</v>

16
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>fundraisers for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

17
00:01:12.091 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a person is capable of giving 50</v>

18
00:01:14.251 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>bucks themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really easy for them to reach</v>

19
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>out to their family and friends and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the strength of personal</v>

20
00:01:20.671 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

21
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>could I get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

22
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 more people to donate 50 bucks,</v>

23
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>then they've just multiplied their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity by 10 times.</v>

24
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who was involved in fundraising</v>
<v Speaker 1>will tell you that that kind of</v>

25
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 1>multiplying effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has huge ramifications.</v>
