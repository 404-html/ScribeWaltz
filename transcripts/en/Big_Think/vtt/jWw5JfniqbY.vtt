1
00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:01.903
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.280
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the great things I love</v>
<v Speaker 2>about San Francisco is so fun.</v>

3
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 2>I just love the typography offer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a great walk into and you just,</v>

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you can walk around San Francisco and</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:15.310
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 2>you get up and one of the hills and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're looking over the city and you're</v>

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 2>just go a completely different aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't believe that you,</v>

8
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just a marriage,</v>

9
00:00:22.681 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 2>don't to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you can just see all over the</v>

10
00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you dip down into the,</v>

11
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 2>into the skin to get Kinda cool</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood you've never seen before</v>

12
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 2>and it's obviously because of it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>always,</v>

13
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's changed me.</v>

14
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:41.670
<v Speaker 2>All American cities are changing because</v>
<v Speaker 2>of maybe,</v>

15
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 2>maybe San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was going to say that affluence is as</v>

16
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.030
<v Speaker 2>driven out the ash to San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to go there and you're used to</v>

17
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 2>and know the economically disadvantaged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to fly to San Francisco and</v>

18
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 2>people used to go there for the vibe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole hippie thing and stuff like</v>

19
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:08.361
<v Speaker 2>that and but I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the recession might kind of</v>

20
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 2>ironically might restore the glory of</v>
<v Speaker 2>San Francisco and away know and stop</v>

21
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.450
<v Speaker 2>being this kind of Yuppie Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of just become the whole</v>

22
00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 2>silicon.</v>
