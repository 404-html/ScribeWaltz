1
00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.280
<v Speaker 1>Everybody seems to think that Obama is</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his heart,</v>

2
00:00:05.281 --> 00:00:10.281
<v Speaker 1>an atheist in India's hardest skeptic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The church he belonged to in Chicago is</v>

3
00:00:11.191 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>a whack job church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about equal to Payton's church.</v>

4
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Granted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't been as religious as do we</v>

5
00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 1>know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we know off the top of our heads,</v>

6
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>the most religious president in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of references referencing to</v>

7
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:29.271
<v Speaker 1>God references to God and in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>appearing in churches who the most</v>

8
00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:32.730
<v Speaker 1>religious president history was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an interesting answer and I get</v>

9
00:00:32.731 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>this information from NPR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's probably not slanted in the way</v>

10
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you'd think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most religious president in history,</v>

11
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>in terms of appearances in churches and</v>
<v Speaker 1>mentions of the Bible was Clinton.</v>

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton is the most religious</v>
<v Speaker 1>president we've had.</v>

13
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>He Beats George Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands down,</v>

14
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>and he beats Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you know was a born again Christian.</v>

15
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>He beats him hands down.</v>

16
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>So Obama does that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean to the nine slash 11 thing.</v>

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>Maybe appropriately he read from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible,</v>

18
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but you have two choices with Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You either believe that he is a man of</v>

19
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Christ who prays for decisions in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>White House,</v>

20
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>which he said he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you think he's a liar.</v>

21
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And I'm surprised by the number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheists,</v>

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>pre thinkers that support Obama and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their argument is essentially he's lying</v>

23
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>about being religious cause you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that to be elected.</v>

24
00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not happy with either one of those.</v>

25
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama is wicked smart.</v>

26
00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.870
<v Speaker 1>He's a wicked good talker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no doubt in my mind that his</v>

27
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 1>heart is in the right place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

28
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that about almost every</v>
<v Speaker 1>president we've had,</v>

29
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.110
<v Speaker 1>but I think he wants to do good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any malicious</v>

30
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:56.280
<v Speaker 1>quality to them at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's some sense he's a</v>

31
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Speaker 1>believer or he's a liar.</v>

32
00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>So one to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I rate them pretty high on the</v>

33
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:07.911
<v Speaker 1>skepticism a maybe a six or a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I rate them that way because</v>

34
00:02:08.851 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in my heart I think he might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be lying about being religious and</v>

35
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>that's horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a horrible reason to like somebody.</v>

36
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>I like him because he may be a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mirabelle Michele Bachmann's blast for</v>

37
00:02:27.181 --> 00:02:31.110
<v Speaker 1>me is greater than anything I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplished.</v>

38
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have tried with friends to say the</v>

39
00:02:35.461 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>most blasphemous his sentence I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly say,</v>

40
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and it does not come close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>blasphemy of Michele Bachmann saying</v>

41
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>that earthquakes and hurricanes were the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way God was trying to get the attention</v>

42
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:55.311
<v Speaker 1>of politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot imagine a serious religious</v>

43
00:02:57.031 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>person reading that quote or hearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that quote and saying,</v>

44
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:03.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right on.</v>

45
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>It is solid cystic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is opportunistic.</v>

46
00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:10.540
<v Speaker 1>It is cynical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is deep and it is wrong.</v>

47
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And it is an insult to religious people</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

48
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.670
<v Speaker 1>For an atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

49
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>it's a burlesque.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit of a joke.</v>

50
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>You can dismiss her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't see it as an atheist.</v>

51
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>I see it from through my father's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>my father was a Christian his whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

53
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and if he had heard Michele Bachmann say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would have looked away from the</v>

54
00:03:33.131 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea that you would lightly state</v>

55
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>that people were suffering and dying in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to,</v>

56
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>to prove that God was on the side of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician is sickening.</v>

57
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.680
<v Speaker 1>The only reason that Bachman and Rick</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perry are able to say this stuff is</v>

58
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 1>because of a magic word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this magic word is Christian,</v>

59
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
<v Speaker 1>and if you look back in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the word Christian doesn't really appear</v>

60
00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.330
<v Speaker 1>in the way we use it today until the</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti abortion debate in the sixties when</v>

61
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:18.241
<v Speaker 1>you had 1890 end of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your top three highest paid speakers.</v>

62
00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>The highest paid speakers were atheist</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking about atheism.</v>

63
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Robert Ingersoll number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Twain,</v>

64
00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huxley.</v>

65
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Number three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ingersoll was the,</v>

66
00:04:32.051 --> 00:04:33.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

67
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 1>the great infidel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great skeptic,</v>

68
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>be a theist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Twain,</v>

69
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:39.640
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are people speaking on.</v>

70
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.160
<v Speaker 1>He was not reading from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not reading from Oxfam.</v>

71
00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>He was reading from letters from Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was reading atheist stuff and Huxley,</v>

72
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Darwin's a pit bull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess bulldog at that time,</v>

73
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I think if it has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a real sense of atheism</v>

74
00:04:53.171 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>being an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were invited to the White House.</v>

75
00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.300
<v Speaker 1>And the reason was that Catholics were</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrified of baptists who were terrified</v>

76
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>of pentecostals or terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lutherans who were terrified of</v>

77
00:05:05.141 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>evangelicals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole list.</v>

78
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't a feeling of Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The founding fathers were very afraid of</v>

79
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>baptists taking over from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pentecostals.</v>

80
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was afraid of the Catholics.</v>

81
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>So you had this divided thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we still had that,</v>

82
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 1>if we still were dividing people by sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like we should be sex like we should be.</v>

83
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:37.500
<v Speaker 1>One of the largest groups in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country would be atheists by the USA</v>

84
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Today poll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was 22 percent,</v>

85
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>20 percent even the lowest polls put it</v>
<v Speaker 1>at eight.</v>

86
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next highest would be Catholics and</v>

87
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>they'd be knocking around 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

88
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>then you've got all your divided up</v>
<v Speaker 1>categories.</v>

89
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>And then abortion happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A legalized abortion.</v>

90
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And some very smart people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very forward thinking.</v>

91
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:09.791
<v Speaker 1>People decided we can never fight</v>
<v Speaker 1>abortion if it's the Catholics fighting</v>

92
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the Protestants and finding the</v>
<v Speaker 1>baptists.</v>

93
00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>Pentecostals fight it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to get them under one tent.</v>

94
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>And there's a great book on this called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of free thought that these</v>

95
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:22.850
<v Speaker 1>are not my ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pull this tent together and they</v>

96
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>kind of create the word Christian and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Carter with born again.</v>

97
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.390
<v Speaker 1>Christian really helps with the word</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>

98
00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.100
<v Speaker 1>So what they've really done is they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken very different philosophies.</v>

99
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean Catholicism and Protestantism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protestantism are very different</v>

100
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 1>philosophies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>

101
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've pulled it together to make</v>

102
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:49.580
<v Speaker 1>this term Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are people that don't agree at all</v>

103
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a Christian message.</v>

104
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:56.591
<v Speaker 1>So Michelle Bachmann and Rick Perry just</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 years ago really recently would have</v>

105
00:06:59.691 --> 00:07:04.691
<v Speaker 1>been terrified to speak about their God</v>
<v Speaker 1>and their church because the second they</v>

106
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>said they were baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second they said they were</v>

107
00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 1>pentecostal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second they said they were Lutheran,</v>

108
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.660
<v Speaker 1>all the other people fall away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now they've got this magic word</v>

109
00:07:17.661 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I am helping make it worse because</v>

110
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:26.261
<v Speaker 1>by using the word atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am separating that even more from</v>

111
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a broader umbrella and I'm</v>

112
00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:31.730
<v Speaker 1>making theist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

113
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>And if you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theist,</v>

114
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 1>atheist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thesis when completely,</v>

115
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I should be doing.</v>

116
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.080
<v Speaker 1>If I were a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

117
00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political thinker,</v>

118
00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.980
<v Speaker 1>if I were someone that was interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements,</v>

119
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:47.480
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm against them.</v>

120
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.930
<v Speaker 1>If I wasn't for individual thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would be one of those people who was</v>

121
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:58.361
<v Speaker 1>saying using a term like free thinker or</v>
<v Speaker 1>open minded and I will be gathering this</v>

122
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 1>umbrella that included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

123
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who self identify as agnostic or</v>

124
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.590
<v Speaker 1>atheist against organized religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would get the wiccans in there.</v>

125
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:16.550
<v Speaker 1>I would get as many people as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I could probably pump that up to 25</v>

126
00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:19.490
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would be also saying,</v>

127
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

128
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.870
<v Speaker 1>the Muslims are very different from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jews who are very different from the</v>

129
00:08:26.511 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Catholics who are very different from</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

130
00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.800
<v Speaker 1>But what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

131
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not interested in tactical</v>

132
00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather in telling the truth,</v>

133
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get theist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>atheist.</v>

134
00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:44.170
<v Speaker 1>But you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can imagine in 1965 a baptist talking</v>

135
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.230
<v Speaker 1>baptist politician talking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion and where they go to church,</v>

136
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>if they have to use word baptist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's using the word Christian that</v>

137
00:08:58.891 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 1>allows this craziness to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

138
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>because I am</v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimist,</v>

139
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>to the point of being incorrect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the point of not being realistic.</v>

140
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 1>That's what flushes over me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's what I feel in my heart is</v>

141
00:09:13.981 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>optimism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tend to go with something Christopher</v>

142
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Hitchens said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember where he said it could</v>

143
00:09:19.801 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>have even been in personal conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

144
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:27.200
<v Speaker 1>but I'm hitchens said that what we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing with this incredible,</v>

145
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:31.260
<v Speaker 1>crazy religious stuff is the death</v>
<v Speaker 1>throws.</v>

146
00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since nine slash 11,</v>

147
00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.250
<v Speaker 1>a free thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atheism is growing so quickly because of</v>

148
00:09:38.251 --> 00:09:43.110
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and people who were seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it first with those who are called.</v>

149
00:09:43.111 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>And I realized this is a racist term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's easiest one to use.</v>

150
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>So please forgive me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

151
00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Gypsy's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing it with the amish.</v>

152
00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:54.740
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing it with the citrix.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

153
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:59.750
<v Speaker 1>all the groups that try to stay as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>subset of America and keep their own</v>

154
00:10:01.381 --> 00:10:06.381
<v Speaker 1>traditions are going away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Elvis chipped away at them and malls</v>

155
00:10:06.601 --> 00:10:08.980
<v Speaker 1>chipped away at them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Internet is going to take them</v>

156
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just too hard to keep your children</v>

157
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>cloistered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to hear Katy Perry.</v>

158
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:21.530
<v Speaker 1>There's just no way to stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to see a video like this.</v>

159
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:23.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once you've gotten on the Internet to</v>

160
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 1>see Katy Perry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not hard to fall over to the big</v>

161
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:29.220
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same keyboard.</v>

162
00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:32.760
<v Speaker 1>It's the same screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the same everything and those that</v>

163
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:37.761
<v Speaker 1>information gets out there and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everybody knows that and everybody</v>

164
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:41.640
<v Speaker 1>feels that so that those who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>

165
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:45.000
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing a a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a desperate,</v>

166
00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:49.710
<v Speaker 1>terrified clawing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the only way you can explain</v>

167
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of desperation coupled with</v>

168
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 1>the magic protective word of Christian.</v>

169
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:04.340
<v Speaker 1>The problem is a movement of individuals</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not going to have the muscle of a</v>

170
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:10.401
<v Speaker 1>cohesive movement of people who believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right and I'm not willing to lie</v>

171
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:13.920
<v Speaker 1>to fight them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want individuals who disagree on</v>

172
00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:18.921
<v Speaker 1>everything and I want us to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>band together for freedom band together</v>

173
00:11:20.101 --> 00:11:23.820
<v Speaker 1>in order to be different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a much harder thing to sell,</v>

174
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>but it's all that matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have to do it.</v>

175
00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Mitt Romney is wearing crazy underwear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's wearing magic underwear.</v>

176
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.400
<v Speaker 1>He is under his pants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is wearing magic underwear,</v>

177
00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:46.400
<v Speaker 1>magic underwear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he believes that a convicted con man</v>

178
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:52.910
<v Speaker 1>got golden tablets that no one else</v>
<v Speaker 1>could see and sat with an angel to find</v>

179
00:11:53.261 --> 00:11:57.400
<v Speaker 1>out that the original Jews of the Bible</v>
<v Speaker 1>were living in North America.</v>

180
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.390
<v Speaker 1>Crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

181
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:02.950
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

182
00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just more modern,</v>

183
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:12.450
<v Speaker 1>not more crazy than other religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not more crazy than Islam,</v>

184
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

185
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.060
<v Speaker 1>not more crazy than virgin births.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And resurrections,</v>

187
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not more crazy than any of that stuff.</v>

188
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.660
<v Speaker 1>It fascinates me</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can have the Bible belt and you</v>

189
00:12:28.931 --> 00:12:31.300
<v Speaker 1>can have a court trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen this.</v>

190
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:35.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use it hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll know the specifics I'm</v>

191
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't want to talk about that</v>

192
00:12:37.511 --> 00:12:40.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of pain directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's too unpleasant for me.</v>

193
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 1>But hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the Bible belt where you can have a</v>

194
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.500
<v Speaker 1>born again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian judge,</v>

195
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>born again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian judge,</v>

196
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 1>I believe the Bible is the literal word</v>
<v Speaker 1>of God.</v>

197
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:59.710
<v Speaker 1>There were talking snakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were talking snakes and virgin</v>

198
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:01.690
<v Speaker 1>births,</v>
<v Speaker 1>burning bushes,</v>

199
00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 1>and Abraham being willing to kill his</v>
<v Speaker 1>son for God.</v>

200
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>He believes that the jury is made up of</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 people who let's say 10 of them</v>

201
00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.780
<v Speaker 1>believed that and to have them believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

202
00:13:16.781 --> 00:13:21.781
<v Speaker 1>but a little less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're prosecuting attorney believes</v>

203
00:13:22.901 --> 00:13:27.901
<v Speaker 1>that the people that are sitting in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courtroom believed that these are all</v>

204
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:33.421
<v Speaker 1>people that know each other in church</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the person on the witness stand says</v>

205
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:40.500
<v Speaker 1>that she killed her three children in</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold blood because God told her to</v>

206
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.140
<v Speaker 1>and every single person in the courtroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>decides whether she is guilty or not</v>

207
00:13:51.851 --> 00:13:54.550
<v Speaker 1>guilty by reason of insanity.</v>

208
00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two choices they way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

209
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 1>not the defense attorney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the judge,</v>

210
00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.020
<v Speaker 1>not the jury people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the people in the gallery,</v>

211
00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:10.230
<v Speaker 1>not one person stands up and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe God told her to.</v>

212
00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:14.770
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's less weird than the talking snake.</v>

213
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe God told her to and in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country which they say over and over</v>

214
00:14:21.401 --> 00:14:26.401
<v Speaker 1>again is founded on Christian values and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give them that founded on Christian</v>

215
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:27.550
<v Speaker 1>values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

216
00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country founded on Christian values</v>

217
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:37.800
<v Speaker 1>has guilty not guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not guilty by reason of insanity.</v>

218
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:43.600
<v Speaker 1>End of list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is nothing that says not guilty</v>

219
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:48.690
<v Speaker 1>because God told me to and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't that there?</v>

220
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Why isn't this country allowing them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the court system,</v>

221
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 1>someone to go on the witness stand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

222
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.880
<v Speaker 1>snake walk up to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snake opened his mouth.</v>

223
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Snake said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into Mcdonald's.</v>

224
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Pull out an eight K,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 killed 10 people walk back out.</v>

225
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.470
<v Speaker 1>Snake told me that it's that snake</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

226
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>He's not talking anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I throw myself on the mercy of the</v>

227
00:15:15.681 --> 00:15:17.780
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you all good Christians?</v>

228
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Don't you believe in the miracles of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bible?</v>

229
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:25.150
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing one now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's.</v>

230
00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:30.110
<v Speaker 1>That's the part that amazes me is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff.</v>

231
00:15:30.111 --> 00:15:35.111
<v Speaker 1>So Mitt Romney comes along and at some</v>
<v Speaker 1>level doesn't he know what he believes</v>

232
00:15:36.951 --> 00:15:41.951
<v Speaker 1>is crazy at some level is any going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weren't Jews in North America?</v>

233
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.030
<v Speaker 1>You know that's not where the garden of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eden was.</v>

234
00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't that go through his mind?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the part of that whole thing</v>

235
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.100
<v Speaker 1>that kills me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Mitt Romney,</v>

236
00:15:59.101 --> 00:16:03.650
<v Speaker 1>he really believes what he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes he is bugged,</v>

237
00:16:03.651 --> 00:16:07.730
<v Speaker 1>nutty bat shit crazy and he's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>bugged.</v>

238
00:16:07.731 --> 00:16:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Nutty batshit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the same as Obama.</v>

239
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.070
<v Speaker 1>If Obama believes what he was being</v>
<v Speaker 1>taught in that church in Chicago,</v>

240
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:21.730
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is bat shit crazy and Obama is</v>

241
00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:23.120
<v Speaker 1>demonstrative.</v>

242
00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Lee Not batshit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have this weird deal we make with</v>

243
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:34.541
<v Speaker 1>all the politicians where we say you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you believe bug nutty bat shit,</v>

244
00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:41.480
<v Speaker 1>crazy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll shrug it off because you're</v>

245
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 1>clearly not bugged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nutty batshit crazy.</v>

246
00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:49.780
<v Speaker 1>And all I want out of our politicians is</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to just say,</v>

247
00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the religious stuff I'm talking</v>

248
00:16:52.371 --> 00:16:54.890
<v Speaker 1>about is bugged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>duddy bad shit.</v>

249
00:16:54.891 --> 00:16:58.550
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not because I don't think any of</v>

250
00:16:58.551 --> 00:17:03.380
<v Speaker 1>these men and women are crazy and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>even give you Michele Bachmann.</v>

251
00:17:03.381 --> 00:17:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll even give you a rick Perry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll even give you Sarah Pailin.</v>

252
00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't have that cynical msnbc point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view that they are bugged,</v>

253
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:16.280
<v Speaker 1>nutty batshit crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they are good people who somehow</v>

254
00:17:16.281 --> 00:17:21.281
<v Speaker 1>think that their morality and their love</v>
<v Speaker 1>for humanity and their love for their</v>

255
00:17:21.831 --> 00:17:26.270
<v Speaker 1>families are tied up in this weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition and when they think that the</v>

256
00:17:26.271 --> 00:17:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Bible is the word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they mean something else.</v>

257
00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:35.440
<v Speaker 1>I sometimes think that many other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are speaking in a code that I've not</v>

258
00:17:36.291 --> 00:17:37.550
<v Speaker 1>been given.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key to.</v>

259
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:42.650
<v Speaker 1>When someone says to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the Bible literally,</v>

260
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.440
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I personally pendulum read about a</v>

261
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 1>chapter of the Bible a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just read through it over and over</v>

262
00:17:48.711 --> 00:17:52.800
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when someone says they believe in the</v>

263
00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:56.130
<v Speaker 1>word of God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally I go back and think about</v>

264
00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.260
<v Speaker 1>genesis where people are living to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>900 years old and I say bullshit and</v>

265
00:18:01.261 --> 00:18:05.310
<v Speaker 1>then I even think about noah and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>flood killing everybody,</v>

266
00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:09.660
<v Speaker 1>God that loves us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kills everybody and he wants to get two</v>

267
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:14.661
<v Speaker 1>of every species and several of the ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are clean onto a boat that floats</v>

268
00:18:14.791 --> 00:18:19.791
<v Speaker 1>for that amount of time and I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you don't act that way.</v>

269
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.760
<v Speaker 1>You're able to go to home depot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're able to play pay with a credit</v>

270

273
00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:34.200

<v Speaker 1>Do you really mean you're going to stone</v>

<v Speaker 1>on the sabbath or you're really going to</v>

<v Speaker 1>and throw it in a motherfucker's head</v>
