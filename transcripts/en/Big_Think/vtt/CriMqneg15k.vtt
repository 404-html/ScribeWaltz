00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Mary poppins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell you that I have to look back</v>

2
00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.470
<v Speaker 1>and see how far we've come in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements,</v>

3
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>all social movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every social movement faces this</v>

4
00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>massive uphill battle of being laughed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

5
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>scorned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejected,</v>

6
00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can look back and just be amazed at</v>

7
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:28.010
<v Speaker 1>the things humans have done to others in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>

8
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>So that is encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I look at the enormity of what's a</v>

9
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.730
<v Speaker 1>hedge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's discouraging,</v>

10
00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>

11
00:00:36.711 --> 00:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>Because you'd never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't get to that crystal ball.</v>

12
00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>You'll never know whether you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to succeed or a meteor writer's going to</v>

13
00:00:44.391 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>hit the earth and it won't matter</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

14
00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>So I feel that I can do is as much as I</v>
<v Speaker 1>can in this finite amount of time I</v>

15
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you get older,</v>

16
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>time goes quicker and you realize how</v>
<v Speaker 1>little you have left,</v>

17
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>not when you're young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem to be that,</v>

18
00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in that small time,</v>

19
00:01:03.231 --> 00:01:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I think you can do as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly can stink to do in case it's</v>

20
00:01:07.251 --> 00:01:10.180
<v Speaker 1>going to make a big difference and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big knock on door,</v>

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 2>which is your.</v>
