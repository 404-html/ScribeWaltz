1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You have to slow down and slowing down</v>
<v Speaker 1>means you have to reflect and it means</v>

2
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>that you have to listen and listen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen some more.</v>

3
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 1>When you start to truly listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is that you begin to again,</v>

4
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>self reflect and that isn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most comfortable thing.</v>

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Over the last 25 years in working in</v>
<v Speaker 1>professional service firms over and over</v>

6
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would find myself talking with</v>

7
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:41.121
<v Speaker 1>conversing with individuals who in many</v>
<v Speaker 1>respects never wanted to slow down</v>

8
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.380
<v Speaker 1>incredibly smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit defensive when you gave</v>

9
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>them feedback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.540
<v Speaker 1>felt in many respects that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good at everything that they did,</v>

11
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without ever asking actually some tough</v>

12
00:00:57.121 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>questions about whether they really were</v>
<v Speaker 1>competent or not in things like</v>

13
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:05.721
<v Speaker 1>management,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who after a while seem to spend more</v>

14
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.761
<v Speaker 1>time managing their image than actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>worrying about are,</v>

15
00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>am I really improving or am I trying new</v>
<v Speaker 1>things?</v>

16
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed like that they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming more and more frightened.</v>

17
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm about about some very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very basic things while their lives seem</v>

18
00:01:23.461 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>to be working and they seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>progressing and they seem to be</v>

19
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.780
<v Speaker 1>achieving and accomplishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for some reason you tell them that</v>

20
00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>they're falling down in a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

21
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 1>what happens is they begin to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves as an absolute failure as</v>

22
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.290
<v Speaker 1>opposed to saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm overwhelmed.</v>

24
00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:40.200
<v Speaker 1>I have a lot of things that I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance.</v>

25
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Anything that gets in the way of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>not accomplishing at the end of the day</v>

26
00:01:46.141 --> 00:01:51.141
<v Speaker 1>starts to feel like a distraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often relationships begin to suffer with</v>

27
00:01:52.081 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>these individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find themselves rather than</v>

28
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>listening with their children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find themselves asking for</v>

29
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:02.760
<v Speaker 1>accountability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find themselves a giving directions</v>

30
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>and offering advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They find themselves asking questions</v>

31
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.220
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did you do today?</v>

32
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you done your homework?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you applied for college?</v>

33
00:02:10.561 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're seven years old.</v>

34
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you applying for college?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How was your room dirty?</v>

35
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>And so they're still in that role of</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplish.</v>

36
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>Check things off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you start having those kinds of</v>

37
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>feelings of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

38
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>I may be inadequate and these other</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

39
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.870
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you find yourself going</v>
<v Speaker 1>faster and faster.</v>
