1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.741
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 2>mostly what I do is analysis and if we</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about analysis,</v>

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a book or an opinion</v>
<v Speaker 2>column,</v>

5
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.220
<v Speaker 2>when it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it helps you read the newspaper better,</v>

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.941
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

8
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just giving people information,</v>

9
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:29.040
<v Speaker 2>it's giving people analysis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting the dots between a few</v>

10
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.760
<v Speaker 2>different pieces of information that</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates that sort of Aha click of</v>

11
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 2>clarity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.410
<v Speaker 2>and when you read strong analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clear analysis and it makes you feel</v>

13
00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 2>better equipped,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

14
00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of ammo and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so as an opinion writer,</v>

15
00:00:46.681 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 2>as a columnist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's my goal is helping</v>

16
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.590
<v Speaker 2>people get more of those cliques of</v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding because I think that we</v>

17
00:00:55.591 --> 00:01:00.591
<v Speaker 2>feel bombarded with information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are bombarded with information,</v>

18
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 2>but we are extremely disoriented and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

19
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to do now with this book</v>

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.920
<v Speaker 2>is I feel like we're still in somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a state of shock from September 11th.</v>

21
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that a state of shock is about a gap</v>

22
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.940
<v Speaker 2>that opens up between an event and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

23
00:01:24.941 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our analysis of that event.</v>

24
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's what shocked means something</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens that so big that we lose our</v>

25
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 2>collective story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the Bush administration has</v>

26
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 2>been really adept at heightening that</v>
<v Speaker 2>state of disorientation by telling</v>

27
00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:44.070
<v Speaker 2>people everything you thought you knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>before September 11th is wrong.</v>

28
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 2>We're rebooting history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're starting over.</v>

29
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about what,</v>

30
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what most people wanted to do after</v>

31
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:54.861
<v Speaker 2>September 11th is they actually wanted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do the work to integrate that event</v>

32
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 2>into their story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

33
00:01:57.961 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was an event that seemed to come</v>

34
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:01.110
<v Speaker 2>out of nowhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing comes out of nowhere.</v>

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.330
<v Speaker 2>So people wanted to know history and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

36
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 2>they were hungry for that knowledge that</v>
<v Speaker 2>could bridge the gap between event and</v>

37
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 2>collective and enter collective story.</v>

38
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I guess that's what I see myself</v>

39
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:18.600
<v Speaker 2>doing is helping that bridging process</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when we're in a state of shock,</v>

40
00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 2>we're very vulnerable to political</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation.</v>

41
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 2>We're frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we regress.</v>

42
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 2>We think Rudy Giuliani's are long lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>daddy,</v>

43
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:26.221
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

44
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 2>this is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

45
00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good politicians were effective</v>

46
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not good politicians,</v>

47
00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:36.060
<v Speaker 2>but effective politicians understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are very powerful in those</v>

48
00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:41.061
<v Speaker 2>moments when people are disoriented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So analysis a,</v>

49
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.920
<v Speaker 2>it connects the dots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gives us a new story and orients us.</v>

50
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when we're better citizens.</v>

51
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:53.430
<v Speaker 2>That's when we can engage in debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's when were harder to manipulate.</v>

52
00:02:53.431 --> 00:02:55.140
<v Speaker 2>That's when we're smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a calmer,</v>

53
00:02:55.141 --> 00:02:56.540
<v Speaker 2>more focused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

54
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:57.451
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

55
00:02:57.451 --> 00:02:59.300
<v Speaker 2>that's what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what all analysis.</v>
