1
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2
00:00:04.581 --> 00:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>I think that's always sort of the fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>part about the story about deal stories</v>

3
00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:13.741
<v Speaker 1>is that they often have this almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>movie like quality to them where they're</v>

4
00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>meeting in secret hotel rooms and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>have project code words and you have</v>

5
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>teams of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes hundreds of people who are</v>

6
00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>under this kind of a cone of silence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>how they make a deal happen or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes there's not just two people</v>

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.140
<v Speaker 1>coming together in a friendly way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's multiple bidders.</v>

9
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>Someone is the jilted lover who doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get their,</v>

10
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get the bride.</v>

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>And so there really is a great story</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

12
00:00:39.041 --> 00:00:41.290
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you asked how do these deals really come</v>

13
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in one way,</v>

14
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.400
<v Speaker 1>in every situation somebody is looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an opportunity.</v>

15
00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Everyone in the deal world is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunist,</v>

16
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>so they're looking at the stock price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at the relationship</v>

17
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.190
<v Speaker 1>between the CEO and the board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at whether the CEO is</v>

18
00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:00.080
<v Speaker 1>about to be ousted and maybe there's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to come in then and there.</v>

19
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 1>They're looking for weakness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

20
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>oftentimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

21
00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that collectively is,</v>

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the great soap opera that makes my</v>

23
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>job so much</v>

24
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.783
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

26
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>what's made this actually so interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the deal landscape,</v>

27
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the players,</v>

28
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the importance of the relative</v>

29
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>importance of each player has changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>dramatically in the past,</v>

30
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>say 12 or 18 months or 12 months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important people on the planet</v>

31
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Speaker 1>were these people called private equity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a misnomer for what</v>

32
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>would otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a polite way to describe Lbo is or,</v>

33
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>or leveraged buyouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of a less polite word that</v>

34
00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>people didn't like in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

35
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>whether it was Henry Kravis or Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schwarzman from blackstone or the guys</v>

36
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 1>at tpg or Carlyle in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys with the power players,</v>

37
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>they were the hitters because they had</v>
<v Speaker 1>amassed all this money and we're</v>

38
00:01:56.541 --> 00:02:00.530
<v Speaker 1>spending it at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at outrigger outrageous songs at an</v>

39
00:02:00.531 --> 00:02:04.700
<v Speaker 1>outrageous pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you saw some very big blue chip</v>

40
00:02:04.701 --> 00:02:05.910
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.740
<v Speaker 1>get taken out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get bought in these massive buyouts.</v>

42
00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>now that we've had this credit crunch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

44
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>they still have cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't,</v>

45
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.690
<v Speaker 1>they can't add the steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

46
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>They can't add the juice that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>their formula work and therefore they're</v>

47
00:02:22.131 --> 00:02:26.310
<v Speaker 1>sort of sidelined and now you're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>big corporations big what they call</v>

48
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.870
<v Speaker 1>strategic players come in and start</v>
<v Speaker 1>making deals.</v>

49
00:02:29.871 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>They had sort of been cast aside because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't afford to pay the premiums</v>

50
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>that private equity was paying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And frankly,</v>

51
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 1>it's unclear where the private equity</v>
<v Speaker 1>should've been paying those premiums to</v>

52
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see how those deals work out.</v>

53
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.330
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

54
00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the news there's rumors about Inbev,</v>

55
00:02:43.791 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>the beer distributor in beer</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer trying to buy budweiser,</v>

56
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a anheuser busch.</v>

57
00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:50.870
<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

58
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big strategic deal,</v>

59
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that about a year ago probably wouldn't</v>

60
00:02:55.101 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're seeing sort of major</v>

61
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.880
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that had sort of been,</v>

62
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>hadn't really been thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisitions because they didn't know</v>

63
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>how to compete against private equity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

64
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>is the new power player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no longer a cabal of 10 or five</v>

65
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>guys from the private equity world who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to rule the world for the next</v>

66
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really the CEO's of big</v>

67
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>corporations and the bankers and lawyers</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes that are making these</v>

68
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:16.774
<v Speaker 1>deals happen.</v>

69
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Hot Sector is always a dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>question because,</v>

70
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

71
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>you can never get the answer right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just when you think it's hard.</v>

72
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think right now you're going to see</v>

74
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>transactions in the financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they call financial services banks.</v>

75
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs rescue financing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You saw this,</v>

76
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>all the banks go through this period in</v>
<v Speaker 1>November,</v>

77
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>December where they wrote down billions</v>
<v Speaker 1>upon tens of billions of dollars and</v>

78
00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>they needed more cash to keep up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stay afloat frankly.</v>

79
00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>And you saw them go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they say go to the desert.</v>

80
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would go to the Middle East and</v>

81
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>raise money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're going to see a lot more</v>

82
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>of that over the next couple of weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly.</v>

83
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>And I think you're also going to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>banks that need to consolidate and</v>

84
00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>there's always been consolidation than</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial services area,</v>

85
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>but I think you're gonna see more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of that.</v>

86
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Obviously bear stearns in trouble goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and is now owned by JP Morgan,</v>

87
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:18.670
<v Speaker 1>but you're going to see countrywide gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>bought by a bank of America.</v>

88
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>These are deals that are not going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the calls from strength to</v>

89
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 1>strength.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are,</v>

90
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.340
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are truly going to be distressed</v>

91
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>deals were some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some strong players taking over</v>

92
00:04:27.781 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>distressed player and is seeing as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked about being an opportunistic,</v>

93
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.490
<v Speaker 1>being an opportunist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>really trying to take advantage of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
