1
00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>The New York Police Department over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 12 years has made extraordinary</v>

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:08.691
<v Speaker 1>progress in reducing crime in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started 20 slash 25 years ago.</v>

3
00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm an idea that a called compstat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was the idea that,</v>

4
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn all the data that we have about</v>

5
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:24.960
<v Speaker 1>crime transparent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us see in infinite detail where it's</v>

6
00:00:24.961 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's doing it,</v>

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives us the opportunity to then manage</v>

8
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>a crime control very precisely and very</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very effectively and move our</v>

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:42.441
<v Speaker 1>resources where crime was and in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it down in extraordinary ways.</v>

10
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>But what we also saw was that over these</v>
<v Speaker 1>last 12 years,</v>

11
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 1>the move to crime control costs than New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York police department,</v>

12
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>citizen support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs the New York Police Department,</v>

13
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:56.551 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>the support of citizens for an</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly important mission,</v>

15
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>which was crime control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that it's possible to have a</v>

16
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>great crime control and strong citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>support and we know that it's possible</v>

17
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>as well to truly engage police officers</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that work.</v>

18
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>When you have those three things moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and when you keep your eye not</v>

19
00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>only on citizens support and workforce</v>
<v Speaker 1>engagement and crime control,</v>

20
00:01:21.961 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>but finally then on outcomes for</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods,</v>

21
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we see we measure our success by</v>

22
00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 1>whether people are playing in parks</v>
<v Speaker 1>where their kids can walk to school</v>

23
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>safely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll have a success in a way that</v>

24
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>we've never had before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've lost,</v>

25
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

26
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>a large segment of New Yorkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>we know that we can get them back and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to and we need to,</v>

28
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>in order to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>will be successful with crime control</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we are able to mobilize all</v>

30
00:01:56.341 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>segments of New York and support of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can't,</v>

31
00:01:59.011 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>then we're not going to have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information that we need.</v>

32
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to have the support that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need.</v>

33
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today's witness will,</v>

34
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won't come forward tomorrow if they</v>

35
00:02:06.601 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>don't see the results.</v>

36
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they,</v>

37
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>we're in a new world today where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

38
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.460
<v Speaker 1>some of the traditional tools of law</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcement have been taken away from</v>

39
00:02:17.461 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>the New York Police Department by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>courts.</v>

40
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop and Frisk.</v>

41
00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.170
<v Speaker 1>We see the effect on the street corners</v>
<v Speaker 1>and public housing.</v>

42
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Trespass laws have been a very effective</v>
<v Speaker 1>tool for law enforcement because we</v>

43
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:31.230
<v Speaker 1>don't need to ask permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are the,</v>

44
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.680
<v Speaker 1>we are the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agents of the public housing.</v>

45
00:02:34.681 --> 00:02:35.514
<v Speaker 1>We can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>we use trespass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>summonses for that kind of control.</v>

47
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.380
<v Speaker 1>Even marijuana stops have been a way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

48
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those three important control tools are</v>

49
00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>now changing for the New York Police</v>
<v Speaker 1>Department and we have to find new ways</v>

50
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.490
<v Speaker 1>to assure safety and security for</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens to do that we will need to</v>

51
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>engage and to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will need to understand far better</v>

52
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:07.141
<v Speaker 1>than we do the sources of citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>support and to see far better than we</v>

53
00:03:07.661 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>ever have before.</v>

54
00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Crime as it as it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it begins to emerge.</v>

55
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:19.770
<v Speaker 1>We know now that some of the hardest</v>
<v Speaker 1>press a precincts and boroughs of New</v>

56
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cruise small groups of kids,</v>

57
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
<v Speaker 1>teenagers have come together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundreds of crews that are</v>

58
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 1>responsible for a great deal of the gun</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence in New York by hearing them</v>

59
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching them speak.</v>

60
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at them on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We understand who is doing a lot of the,</v>

61
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's causing a lot of the damage in the</v>

62
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:52.591
<v Speaker 1>city and we've been able to address that</v>
<v Speaker 1>not by hammering entire communities but</v>

63
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>by precision targeting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.260
<v Speaker 1>these young people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not all of whom were bad boys and bad</v>

65
00:03:59.261 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them are good kids.</v>

66
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm just getting mixed up with bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

67
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and instead of hammering whole</v>

68
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>communities begin to work very</v>
<v Speaker 1>surgically,</v>

69
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.320
<v Speaker 1>that's the future of policing in New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York in its future.</v>

70
00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 1>That's data driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

71
00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>that looks for the supportive</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities by,</v>

72
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by building up,</v>

73
00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.060
<v Speaker 1>our contact and our engagement by social</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

75
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>by using social media also to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ebb and flow of crime and disorder</v>

76
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:34.030
<v Speaker 1>and communities using it appropriately</v>
<v Speaker 1>and safely.</v>

77
00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the new wave of policing in New</v>

78
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>York is the next generation where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure our success now simply by</v>

79
00:04:41.951 --> 00:04:43.570
<v Speaker 1>Compstat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime control numbers,</v>

80
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>but by crime control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus citizen support,</v>

81
00:04:46.481 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>plus workforce engagement plus</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood outcomes.</v>

82
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.110
<v Speaker 1>And we're now able to measure all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those in ways that we never have before.</v>

83
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And we planned to so that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we achieve crime control,</v>

84
00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.370
<v Speaker 1>we lift support and we lived in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>workforce engagement and we achieve</v>

85
00:05:02.841 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>great results for neighborhoods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really our goal.</v>

86
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>And I think what we can do next.</v>
