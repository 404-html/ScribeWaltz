1
00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.490
<v Speaker 1>There are four fundamental forces of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature as we now understand it,</v>

2
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>there's gravity and electromagnetism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are the classic forces which were</v>

3
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.490
<v Speaker 1>known already in prehistory and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and known in some form to the ancient</v>

4
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which had mature theories in the</v>

5
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:30.620
<v Speaker 1>case of gravity already in the 17th</v>
<v Speaker 1>century with Newton,</v>

6
00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>end of the 19th century with Maxwell and</v>
<v Speaker 1>very beautiful descriptions in and in</v>

7
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>case of gravity made even more beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Einstein's general theory of</v>

8
00:00:40.791 --> 00:00:45.791
<v Speaker 1>relativity in the early 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the course of studying a</v>

9
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>subatomic physics and in what goes on at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

10
00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>very short distances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people found they needed to additional</v>

11
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>forces like gravity and electromagnetism</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't enough,</v>

12
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>and the two additional forces are called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strong and weak forces.</v>

13
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.330
<v Speaker 1>What I got the Nobel prize for was</v>
<v Speaker 1>figuring out the equations of the strong</v>

14
00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:09.830
<v Speaker 1>force and equally important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just guessing the equations,</v>

15
00:01:09.831 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>but showing how you could test them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>see that they were right.</v>

16
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.870
<v Speaker 1>This was something I did as a graduate</v>
<v Speaker 1>student.</v>

17
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.910
<v Speaker 1>I was of course working very closely</v>
<v Speaker 1>with my thesis advisor at very,</v>

18
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>very gifted and a powerful physicist</v>
<v Speaker 1>named David.</v>

19
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Gross,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how did we go about doing it?</v>

21
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.550
<v Speaker 1>there were some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were the experimental situation</v>

23
00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>regarding the strong interaction was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very confused,</v>

24
00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>desperately confused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no theory even remotely worthy</v>

25
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>of standing behind beside Newton's</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory of gravity or Einstein's or</v>

26
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>maxwell's theory of electromagnetism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just a lot of rules of thumb</v>

27
00:01:49.371 --> 00:01:54.371
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of confusing data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we did was focus on one particular</v>

28
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:03.020
<v Speaker 1>phenomena and try to understand just</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

29
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>putting off all other aspects of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>confusing a situation.</v>

30
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>The phenomena we tried to understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems so paradoxical,</v>

31
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:20.351
<v Speaker 1>so crazy that we thought if we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that we could understand</v>

32
00:02:21.021 --> 00:02:22.890
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also seen because it seems so</v>

35
00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>profound and fundamental.</v>

36
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually David thought that we could</v>

37
00:02:32.241 --> 00:02:35.060
<v Speaker 1>prove that it couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you couldn't just couldn't</v>

38
00:02:35.061 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>understand that within the standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>framework of quantum mechanics and</v>

39
00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Speaker 1>relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that would be a very important</v>

40
00:02:41.391 --> 00:02:45.590
<v Speaker 1>result too because we'd tell a physicist</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to go back to the drawing</v>

41
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This aspect that we were trying to</v>

42
00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 1>explain was the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>corks,</v>

43
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>which were somewhat speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a pretty clear indication of reality</v>

44
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 1>at that time when they get close</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

45
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:09.210
<v Speaker 1>hardly interact at all or when they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving at very high velocity relative to</v>

46
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:11.890
<v Speaker 1>one of them there at high energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

47
00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:16.891
<v Speaker 1>they don't interact very much at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you try to pull them apart,</v>

48
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>a significant distance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means in this case,</v>

49
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>10 to the minus 13 centimeters or more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>or if they're moving slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.450
<v Speaker 1>then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.300
<v Speaker 1>have very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very powerful forces.</v>

53
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't extract single corks from</v>

54
00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.500
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always exist bound to one another</v>

55
00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:43.501
<v Speaker 1>inside protons and neutrons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we needed a force which gets weaker</v>

56
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.880
<v Speaker 1>at short distances and grows as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance growth.</v>

57
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:53.881
<v Speaker 1>That's a very paradoxical and difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to imagine and make consistent</v>

58
00:03:54.521 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>with the other laws of physics that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

59
00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now there were powerful mathematical</v>

60
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>techniques.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're investigating that kind of</v>

61
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:08.911
<v Speaker 1>question that had been developed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>other for other purposes called</v>

62
00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>renormalization group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were able to bring those</v>

63
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>techniques to bear and address this</v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

64
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:19.240
<v Speaker 1>And they were very difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculations,</v>

65
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't entirely clear that they were</v>

66
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>concise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent that you could actually do</v>

67
00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>this kind of calculation in the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that there was most beautiful</v>

68
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>that we wanted to investigate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but we insisted on hoping that the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful equations would be the right</v>

70
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:40.534
<v Speaker 1>equations.</v>

71
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And we found out that a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very special class of theoretical,</v>

72
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructions with tremendous amounts of</v>

73
00:04:53.051 --> 00:04:58.051
<v Speaker 1>symmetry a could give you this behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was,</v>

74
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to say that I compare that to a</v>

75
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>archimedes saying that if you give me a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lever and a place to stand,</v>

76
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>I can lift the world based on that kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a</v>

77
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>leverage given by the sort of basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles and faith in symmetry and</v>

78
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus this one fact about the force is</v>

79
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>getting weaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will lead to quite a unique proposal</v>

80
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 1>for what the equations of the strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction should be.</v>

81
00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And we could develop some consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those equations and then propose to</v>

82
00:05:37.481 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>experimenters that they go out and check</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether these consequences are correct.</v>

83
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Now it took several years afterwards</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it became clear that those</v>

84
00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 1>consequences we predicted were correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are,</v>

85
00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.470
<v Speaker 1>and in subsequent years that's become</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more clear.</v>

86
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>The theory has been used for a wide</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of applications now with great</v>

87
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:05.570
<v Speaker 1>success and the kind of thing that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the early days was called testing</v>

88
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>quantum chromo dynamics or testing</v>
<v Speaker 1>asymptotic freedom is now cold</v>

89
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:13.850
<v Speaker 1>calculating backgrounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's gone from being a glamorous</v>

90
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.650
<v Speaker 1>exploration of new worlds to kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking care of the garbage so that you</v>

91
00:06:18.651 --> 00:06:19.484
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>you can look for more interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

93
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:23.380
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:24.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

95
00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.930
<v Speaker 1>although it sounds in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a,</v>

96
00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.630
<v Speaker 1>a step down in a few if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

97
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>look at it in the big picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's glorious that you have a theory</v>

98
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:39.620
<v Speaker 1>that was originally very speculative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just something that existed in our</v>

99
00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:41.200
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.260
<v Speaker 1>and we had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's gone now too.</v>

101
00:06:45.261 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>Being an absolutely accepted and basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of our understanding of nature and</v>

102
00:06:49.761 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>a very beautiful.</v>
