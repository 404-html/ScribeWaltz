00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's had a dramatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect.</v>

2
00:00:09.581 --> 00:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not probably a great effect,</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>is that a lot of the new shows now try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to show that they have a sense of humor</v>

4
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

5
00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

6
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>that they can be rascals as well or make</v>
<v Speaker 1>fun of themselves.</v>

7
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

9
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure how valuable that is.</v>

10
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:38.011
<v Speaker 1>I think probably their anchors on these</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows are less likely to say things</v>

11
00:00:40.301 --> 00:00:44.380
<v Speaker 1>without thinking if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're concerned that they might be</v>

12
00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:46.750
<v Speaker 1>made fun of on a show like the daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

13
00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>So that can't be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's made the gun gun shy</v>

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>in a way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the audience isn't being served.</v>

15
00:00:53.711 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.383
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>

19
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.480
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sad reality remains that they are,</v>

20
00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>that they respond to what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>their audience wants.</v>

21
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 1>And this current campaign is so riveting</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're sort of on their best</v>

22
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>behavior right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I actually think that the,</v>

23
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

24
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

25
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 1>that the cable news nats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are sort of flawed because they</v>

26
00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:28.861
<v Speaker 1>feel that they need to keep filling all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this time least it's being filled with,</v>

27
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>with more substantive politics than</v>
<v Speaker 1>usual.</v>
