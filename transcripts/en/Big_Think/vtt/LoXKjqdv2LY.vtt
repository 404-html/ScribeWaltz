1
00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 2>The so called liberal argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is probably more liberal today</v>

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.900
<v Speaker 2>than it has been in many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many decades.</v>

4
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:17.550
<v Speaker 2>they argue that we should have equal</v>
<v Speaker 2>equality.</v>

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Everybody should be equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should all make the same amount of</v>

7
00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should all have the same assets and</v>

8
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that.</v>

9
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I think that's fundamentally inimical to</v>
<v Speaker 2>free market capitalism.</v>

10
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a kind of Soviet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 2>East Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

12
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 2>old communist socialist model that has</v>
<v Speaker 2>never worked you,</v>

13
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:41.360
<v Speaker 2>you can't make anybody everybody equal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They tried to redistrict it,</v>

14
00:00:41.361 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 2>redistribute income and wealth rather</v>
<v Speaker 2>than increase it.</v>

15
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my credo here is instead of making the</v>

16
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 2>economic pie smaller and handling</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller pieces to everyone,</v>

17
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 2>let's make the pie bigger and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody a larger piece.</v>

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And I think history has proven really</v>
<v Speaker 2>since the fall of Soviet communism that</v>

19
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 2>that model of income leveling is a bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

20
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a mild does work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It took seven years for the Soviets to</v>

21
00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 2>felt fall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they fell.</v>

22
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 2>And China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

23
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.110
<v Speaker 2>the other big communist country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say that they've fallen,</v>

24
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.190
<v Speaker 2>but they've changed their economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's now much more of a market oriented</v>

25
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 2>economy in my judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Markets distribute goods,</v>

26
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.690
<v Speaker 2>market set prices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if there are free opportunities</v>

27
00:01:30.691 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 2>inside markets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how people who work hard will do</v>

28
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:37.830
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think the ethos in America is to</v>

29
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 2>work hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's always been where we are.</v>

30
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all start at the same beginning.</v>

31
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.540
<v Speaker 2>The starting line is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By law and tradition,</v>

32
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 2>we should be prejudice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

33
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 2>color free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gender free,</v>

34
00:01:52.921 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have the same legal starting</v>

35
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean we all finish at</v>

36
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 2>the finish line at the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's human nature.</v>

37
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.600
<v Speaker 2>So we talk about this in the book and in</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular as you asked about,</v>

38
00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tax policy,</v>

39
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 2>taxing rich people at high confiscatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>rates has never worked in this country.</v>

40
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.890
<v Speaker 2>It's outside of our tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's been tried a couple of times.</v>

41
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>FDR tried it 1930s and it didn't work</v>

42
00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.590
<v Speaker 2>and the economy was no better in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>late thirties than it was when he took</v>

43
00:02:28.591 --> 00:02:30.500
<v Speaker 2>over in 1932.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

44
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.840
<v Speaker 2>the war spending did help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the great new deal experiment failed</v>

45
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 2>the great times of prosperity in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

46
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 2>It's so when we lower tax rates and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shrank government,</v>

47
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 2>we put government in a lesser position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a believer in the private sector.</v>

48
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 2>The government does not run the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We run the economy.</v>

49
00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 2>So you go back and look at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable prosperity periods like the</v>

50
00:02:57.091 --> 00:02:59.370
<v Speaker 2>post civil war period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable.</v>

51
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>The 1920s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable prosperity,</v>

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 2>the 1960s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>

53
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 2>The 1980s and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic economic growth.</v>

54
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Those all have some common</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics and usually they include</v>

55
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>low marginal tax rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you keep more of what you earn.</v>

56
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 2>That's a reward for your work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>investment and entrepreneurship.</v>

57
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>less government,</v>

58
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 2>fewer regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean no government.</v>

59
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:34.000
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean no regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm for a safety net,</v>

60
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 2>but it means at some point you go too</v>
<v Speaker 2>far and you're strangling businesses.</v>

61
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 2>You're strangling small businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's who I'm really worried about.</v>

62
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>So that's my basic argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John F.</v>

63
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get right to the chase in this book,</v>

64
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>John F Kennedy's tax cut legacy has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost.</v>

65
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.820
<v Speaker 2>It's a very strange story and that's one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the reasons why Brian Dimitra rich</v>

66
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 2>and I wrote this book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy was the first post World War II</v>

67
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>supply side tax cutting president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the first Eisenhower wouldn't do</v>

68
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the 1950s,</v>

69
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 2>despite certain urban legends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 1950s where allows the economy three</v>

70
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 2>recessions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in eight or nine years,</v>

71
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.910
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>having one by a cat's whisker against</v>

72
00:04:21.281 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy knew that he had to grow the</v>

73
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 2>American economy at 5% a year.</v>

74
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>That was his target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nixon didn't go there and Kennedy never</v>

75
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:36.331
<v Speaker 2>really told us in the 1960 election how</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was going to grow at five,</v>

76
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what we're going to do.</v>

77
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 2>And then he went back and forth with his</v>
<v Speaker 2>advisors in 1961 and 1962 the first step</v>

78
00:04:45.521 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>he made was one I disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot of government spending lots</v>

79
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.540
<v Speaker 2>and lots of government spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>safety net spending,</v>

80
00:04:52.541 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you name it,</v>

81
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 2>which is liberal academic advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

82
00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suggested to him that was their idea,</v>

83
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.330
<v Speaker 2>spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend and leave tax rates high.</v>

84
00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:08.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top tax rate was 91%.</v>

85
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 2>It's inconceivable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you earn an extra dollar,</v>

86
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 2>you get 9 cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but government gets the rest.</v>

87
00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 2>That's a big number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big number.</v>

88
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a long story short or at least this</v>

89
00:05:24.521 --> 00:05:25.240
<v Speaker 2>part of the story.</v>

90
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy had several Republicans in his</v>

91
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:31.960
<v Speaker 2>cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an interesting side note,</v>

92
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 2>but very important for today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them was a guy named Douglas</v>

93
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 2>Dillon who came from a famous banking</v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

94
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like get Kennedy.</v>

95
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 2>He has as much money as JFK,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father and his banking guy and owned</v>

96
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 2>the vineyard in south of France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was Eisenhower's under secretary of</v>

97
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

98
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:56.070
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy puts him in the top tier</v>
<v Speaker 2>Treasury Department and Dylan makes the</v>

99
00:05:56.621 --> 00:06:01.621
<v Speaker 2>argument that the liberals were wrong</v>
<v Speaker 2>and instead we should give men and women</v>

100
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>more opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more rewards,</v>

101
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 2>more incentives to grow the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get paid more,</v>

102
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:18.850
<v Speaker 2>you're likely to work more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if the tax rate is lower on</v>

103
00:06:18.951 --> 00:06:23.951
<v Speaker 2>investment for a new business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you are rewarded with higher pay</v>

104
00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 2>after tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be rejuvenated.</v>

105
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:30.800
<v Speaker 2>You're going to get out there and go for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gold.</v>

106
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 2>And that hasn't been happening since</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War II hadn't happened in the</v>

107
00:06:34.761 --> 00:06:36.010
<v Speaker 2>1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

108
00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.520
<v Speaker 2>it was just throughout one number for</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

109
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 2>It's in that book at 91% tax rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as I said,</v>

110
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 2>you make a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make an extra dollar,</v>

111
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 2>you get 9 cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

112
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 2>The government gets a 91 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

113
00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.080
<v Speaker 2>Ronald Reagan as a movie actor quit</v>
<v Speaker 2>acting because he decided 9 cents on the</v>

114
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 2>dollar was not enough for him to</v>
<v Speaker 2>motivate him.</v>

115
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.180
<v Speaker 2>True Story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

116
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.320
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy cut the top tax rate from 91 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>70.</v>

117
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 2>So instead of taking home 9 cents on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar,</v>

118
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.280
<v Speaker 2>you took home 30 cents on the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an over 200% increase.</v>

119
00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 2>And after tax income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Kennedy argued he was the pioneer</v>

120
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.500
<v Speaker 2>and I Reagan Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this will create opportunities and</v>

121
00:07:27.501 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 2>incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll get government out of the way.</v>

122
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 2>It'll get people work at harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll get them to take risks to start</v>

123
00:07:34.791 --> 00:07:35.624
<v Speaker 2>new companies.</v>

124
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of new companies,</v>

125
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of technology and silicon valley</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff was started in the 60s,</v>

126
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the Kennedy tax cuts.</v>

127
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.130
<v Speaker 2>That was his argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then 20 years later,</v>

128
00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 2>the top rate was at 70,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Reagan cut it the 28 and two steps,</v>

129
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 2>1981,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1986,</v>

130
00:07:52.761 --> 00:07:55.790
<v Speaker 2>28.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now instead of getting 30 cents on</v>

131
00:07:55.791 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 2>the dollar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got 72 cents on the dollar.</v>

132
00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:03.920
<v Speaker 2>It's about 145% increased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I call reward.</v>

133
00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:09.610
<v Speaker 2>That's a basic economic principle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't work to finance the government,</v>

134
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.050
<v Speaker 2>we don't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

135
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 2>unless we are compensated for the hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

136
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.220
<v Speaker 2>we might go on welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not going to necessarily help</v>

137
00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps the poor.</v>

138
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:23.630
<v Speaker 2>But we want less poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want more opportunity.</v>

139
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:27.530
<v Speaker 2>So give us more after tax income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Kennedy did.</v>

140
00:08:27.531 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 2>It's called an incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what Reagan did and it's called</v>

141
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>and a Saturday and both times it worked.</v>

142
00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.610
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennedy,</v>

143
00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 2>the Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people said he was a liberal</v>

144
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:38.151
<v Speaker 2>democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>

145
00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 2>He was not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was very conservative.</v>

146
00:08:39.501 --> 00:08:42.560
<v Speaker 2>But Kenny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Democrats using a Republican</v>

147
00:08:42.561 --> 00:08:45.380
<v Speaker 2>treasury secretary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doug Dawn Reagan,</v>

148
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.320
<v Speaker 2>20 something years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Republican,</v>

149
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who wound Democrats in Congress to get</v>

150
00:08:51.651 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 2>his tax cuts through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They presided over the best economic</v>

151
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 2>decades postwar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is not a coincidence that they</v>

152
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 2>both were tax cutters and we can talk</v>
<v Speaker 2>about this later,</v>

153
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 2>but they also wanted a steady and strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>reliable dollar as our currency.</v>

154
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.940
<v Speaker 2>But incentives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government does not run our,</v>

155
00:09:12.941 --> 00:09:17.280
<v Speaker 2>our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We run our economy as long as we are</v>

156
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:22.140
<v Speaker 2>properly rewarded for our efforts and</v>
<v Speaker 2>our entrepreneurship and Soviet Union.</v>

157
00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.850
<v Speaker 2>The Soviets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>randy economy,</v>

158
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.310
<v Speaker 2>it was horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible,</v>

159
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 2>rampid poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is horrible.</v>

160
00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 2>East Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horrible Latin America,</v>

161
00:09:30.781 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 2>horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then came the free market revolution</v>

162
00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:37.380
<v Speaker 2>and things picked up quite a bit because</v>
<v Speaker 2>people had more economic freedom.</v>

163
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:40.360
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I argue this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

164
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not talking politics here.</v>

165
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:47.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking straight out economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s Republicans and Democrats</v>

166
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:52.770
<v Speaker 2>destroyed the currency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>created double digit inflation and</v>

167
00:09:52.771 --> 00:09:57.030
<v Speaker 2>raised taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the 70s were a horrible period of</v>

168
00:09:57.031 --> 00:10:00.750
<v Speaker 2>economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had 12 15% inflation twice.</v>

169
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 2>The economy barely grew.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then Reagan came in and change that.</v>

170
00:10:04.801 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to make sure,</v>

171
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>this is bipartisan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton,</v>

172
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:14.580
<v Speaker 2>Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did raise the income tax in his first</v>

173
00:10:14.581 --> 00:10:17.790
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he came back a few years later</v>

174
00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:21.480
<v Speaker 2>and cut the capital gains tax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a very important task for</v>

175
00:10:21.481 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 2>investors and risk takers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he acknowledged that he raised</v>

176
00:10:24.511 --> 00:10:27.960
<v Speaker 2>income taxes too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton was also a free trader.</v>

177
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say Clinton was Reagan's</v>
<v Speaker 2>third term,</v>

178
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.340
<v Speaker 2>but he's pretty close to Reagan's third</v>
<v Speaker 2>term.</v>

179
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

180
00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.510
<v Speaker 2>the Democratic Party's hope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully,</v>

181
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.030
<v Speaker 2>hopefully lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't go through this.</v>

182
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:42.150
<v Speaker 2>They want to tax wealthy people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to punish success.</v>

183
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:45.630
<v Speaker 2>It's not the way America does it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the way success is created.</v>
