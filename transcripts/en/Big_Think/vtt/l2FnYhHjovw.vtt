00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.170
<v Speaker 1>What</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is,</v>

2
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.733
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's step back,</v>

3
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bio dynamic wine.</v>

4
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 2>There is a guy named Rudolf Steiner who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a founder,</v>

5
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.610
<v Speaker 2>the founder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bite,</v>

6
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic one movement and he had very</v>

7
00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.030
<v Speaker 2>quirky ideas about making one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

8
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 2>many of these practices have proved to</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 2>improve the sort of the vineyards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the health of the vineyards and that's</v>

10
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:45.350
<v Speaker 2>what really we're talking about having</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy vines and healthy healthy</v>

11
00:00:45.351 --> 00:00:50.351
<v Speaker 2>grapes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was interested in harvesting in the</v>

12
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 2>moonlight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was interested in um,</v>

13
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 2>cow horns filled with dung,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planted in the vineyard.</v>

14
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.120
<v Speaker 2>So there's some quirky things that go</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with biodynamic wine.</v>

15
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 2>but basically we're talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>health of the vineyard and if you have a</v>

17
00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 2>healthy vineyard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should have a really great one with</v>

18
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 2>organic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually a tricky proposition</v>

19
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 2>because in terms of winemaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

20
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.760
<v Speaker 2>what you're looking at usually is</v>
<v Speaker 2>organic grapes,</v>

21
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.510
<v Speaker 2>but there's an entire organic wine</v>
<v Speaker 2>making process that sometimes wine</v>

22
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 2>makers will not carry through.</v>

23
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 2>So is it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The labeling is a little dicey.</v>

24
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 2>So I think what we'll see is wines made</v>
<v Speaker 2>from organic grips,</v>

25
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 2>probably not the entire process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ones that are,</v>

26
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are green and that,</v>

27
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not always reliable are the ones</v>

28
00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 2>that are made without sulfites.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I'm in France,</v>

29
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:57.281
<v Speaker 2>there's an enormous movement and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>wine bars that just have these,</v>

30
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great ones,</v>

31
00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.700
<v Speaker 2>green ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

32
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>without sulphites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those ones aren't very stable.</v>

33
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the sulfites helped to stabilize</v>

34
00:02:05.631 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 2>the wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

35
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think is where you can get an</v>

36
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 2>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing wine</v>

37
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>without sulfites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>

38
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:16.270
<v Speaker 1>you have to be complete.</v>
