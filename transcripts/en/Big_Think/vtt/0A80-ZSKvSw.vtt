1
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:04.863
<v Speaker 1>The mob is very barely turned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best you can hope for with a mob is </v>

2
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>to calm them down a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll,</v>

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>they'll rarely turn.</v>

4
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes you have to walk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly choose your battles.</v>

5
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't throw yourself against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall constantly and survive.</v>

6
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.870
<v Speaker 1>The way I think about integrity is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that at the end of the day,</v>

7
00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 1>there's only one person I have to sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>with and that's myself and am I going to</v>

8
00:00:35.651 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>be able to at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that I acted with integrity.</v>

9
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:40.634
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I treated other people well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I upheld principles that I really </v>

10
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.510
<v Speaker 1>care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that on some days can be really,</v>

11
00:00:46.511 --> 00:00:47.344
<v Speaker 1>really hard because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the evil people who challenge </v>

12
00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>your integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the good people.</v>

13
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>It's the people you like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the people who mostly do the time,</v>

14
00:00:58.331 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>do the right thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what ends up happening is because we</v>

15
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:06.790
<v Speaker 1>have interests in our lives because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're interested in,</v>

16
00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not unreasonably making more money,</v>

17
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting a more comfortable life,</v>

18
00:01:11.591 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>wanting to take care of our friends and </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

19
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Those are the kinds of things that lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>to corruption within systems,</v>

20
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>lead to misuse of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead to people mistreating each other,</v>

21
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.493
<v Speaker 1>and it's not really very hard to call </v>
<v Speaker 1>out when somebody who is known to be </v>

22
00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:31.324
<v Speaker 1>awful is doing something awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much harder when it's the good </v>

23
00:01:34.661 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>people around them cooperating or being </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicit in that situation.</v>

24
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>We said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

25
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>with the me too movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

26
00:01:42.371 --> 00:01:43.204
<v Speaker 1>Where people are now exposing </v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals who have been known to be </v>

27
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:47.974
<v Speaker 1>creepy and awful people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all the people around them decided </v>

28
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:52.414
<v Speaker 1>not to stand up because it was too </v>
<v Speaker 1>costly to them personally or because </v>

29
00:01:55.451 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>they have the attitude of it's not their</v>
<v Speaker 1>job to stand up.</v>

30
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.083
<v Speaker 1>So I think one of the things you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask yourself as you think about whether </v>

31
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:07.941
<v Speaker 1>or not to call out bad behavior is can </v>
<v Speaker 1>you get other people to do it with you?</v>

32
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.033
<v Speaker 1>That will often help lighten the blow of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the backlash and then can you afford to </v>

33
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>lose what it is you might lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for some of us,</v>

34
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>we can afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in my own life for example,</v>

35
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:25.534
<v Speaker 1>I've been able in many circumstances to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead and call out bad behavior </v>

36
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>because I have the resources to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>the backlash,</v>

37
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.453
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

38
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I always try to think of at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the day and at the end of my life when I</v>

39
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>look back will I feel like I did the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>

40
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.503
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was raised in a conservative Roman </v>

41
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Catholic family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the message to my from my parents</v>

42
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for my dad was always,</v>

43
00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do the right thing,</v>

44
00:02:57.171 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>he go to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do the wrong thing,</v>

45
00:02:58.401 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you go to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>I never had faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never worked for me.</v>

47
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.034
<v Speaker 1>So I became an atheist very cognitively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the time I was about probably 14 and </v>

48
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:10.870
<v Speaker 1>certainly by 16 and 18 I knew that I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>no belief in heaven and hell.</v>

49
00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.123
<v Speaker 1>So then there was the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you make sure you do the right </v>

50
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.294
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me it was really clear because </v>

51
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>my mother had said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>all the dog when the world you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really need,</v>

53
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day what you need is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know did you treat other people well?</v>

54
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.023
<v Speaker 1>Did you take care of injustice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me that was a very clear </v>

55
00:03:32.621 --> 00:03:34.510
<v Speaker 1>organizing principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>

56
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm not thinking about what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>after I die.</v>

57
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking about the end of the day </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the end of my life and thinking if I</v>

58
00:03:39.851 --> 00:03:40.684
<v Speaker 1>look back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will I feel good about what I did or </v>

59
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:43.894
<v Speaker 1>will I feel crummy about what I did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Catholicism irritates me for many </v>

60
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the reasons that irritates me</v>

61
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.920
<v Speaker 1>is because it has the confessional </v>
<v Speaker 1>booth.</v>

62
00:03:53.921 --> 00:03:54.754
<v Speaker 1>And what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you've done something </v>

63
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:59.710
<v Speaker 1>that lacks integrity is you go into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>confessional booth and you tell somebody</v>

64
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>who had nothing to do with the situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you did it in.</v>

65
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:05.400
<v Speaker 1>That person forgives you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's I'm sorry.</v>

66
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Shitty system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can bleep it out if you have to.</v>

67
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>That's a system in which you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

68
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>There isn't really accountability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.360
<v Speaker 1>Where somebody is able to just let you </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the hook and if you're going to live</v>

70
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:21.004
<v Speaker 1>with integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to not have that ability to go </v>

71
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:25.510
<v Speaker 1>by the little ticket and get out of jail</v>
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>

72
00:04:25.511 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do your seven hail Marys and beyond your</v>

73
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:28.984
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need a situation where you have an </v>

74
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>inner voice that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>you did that badly and you need to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>good on it,</v>

76
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.613
<v Speaker 1>and then you go and you apologize to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person you hurt not to the priest and </v>

77
00:04:39.341 --> 00:04:41.740
<v Speaker 1>you go and you promised not to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

78
00:04:41.741 --> 00:04:42.940
<v Speaker 1>not to God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the person.</v>

79
00:04:42.941 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>You did it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you have I think,</v>

80
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>moral accountability on the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where we live.</v>

81
00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>The moral experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't live it in the afterlife.</v>

82
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Every time I've ever called out bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>

83
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:57.154
<v Speaker 1>I've been called bad every single time </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I called out the FDA on </v>

84
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:02.224
<v Speaker 1>inappropriate behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I challenged the office for human </v>

85
00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:05.104
<v Speaker 1>research protections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I named Cornell and Mount Sinai </v>

86
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.513
<v Speaker 1>medical school is participating in </v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic human subjects research on </v>

87
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:11.914
<v Speaker 1>pregnant women.</v>

88
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.443
<v Speaker 1>When I at my local newspaper reveal that</v>
<v Speaker 1>city council made deals that they </v>

89
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:18.664
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't have made that were not in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best interest of the taxpayers over and </v>

90
00:05:23.741 --> 00:05:27.280
<v Speaker 1>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been called bad.</v>

91
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

92
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:29.704
<v Speaker 1>there was one time in my life that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was some kids that were acting </v>

93
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>incredibly violently at the bus stop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody turned to me and said,</v>

94
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>alice has to fix this because alice </v>
<v Speaker 1>fixes everything.</v>

95
00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.870
<v Speaker 1>And so because I'm the New Yorker in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Midwest,</v>

96
00:05:40.871 --> 00:05:41.704
<v Speaker 1>so I fix everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the person who is expected to be </v>

97
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.540
<v Speaker 1>obnoxious and cost stuff out because I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>a New Yorker.</v>

98
00:05:46.541 --> 00:05:51.541
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I ended up trying to deal with this,</v>

99
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.073
<v Speaker 1>trying to call the school system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which didn't help trying to deal with </v>

100
00:05:55.661 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which didn't help.</v>

101
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:57.514
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately one day just lost it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>drag one of these kids home and </v>

102
00:06:00.051 --> 00:06:00.884
<v Speaker 1>presented them to the parents who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>not at the bus stop is they were </v>

103
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be in.</v>

104
00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 1>The father throttled me and I'm in front</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the kids,</v>

105
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>which was rough for me because it's one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to be throttled.</v>

106
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:13.124
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to scare a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids and I had to do a lot of soul </v>

107
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>searching about the question of whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>or not I should have bothered right,</v>

108
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.003
<v Speaker 1>particularly because everybody in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood kept coming to my front </v>

109
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:25.640
<v Speaker 1>door wanting to tell me how bad they </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt about this,</v>

110
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted me to take care of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were feeling bad about this</v>

111
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>and I thought to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>like at what point do we say it's my job</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix all the bad stuff in the world,</v>

113
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.803
<v Speaker 1>but maybe if more of us thought it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe if more of us had that New Yorker </v>

114
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>voice in our heads rather than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>midwestern voice in our heads,</v>

115
00:06:46.731 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>the New Yorker voice to me saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do get involved.</v>

116
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>The midwestern boy says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get involved.</v>

117
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Don't get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't get involved.</v>

118
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.610
<v Speaker 1>If more of us had the attitude of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

119
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it is our job to step up and stand</v>
<v Speaker 1>up to injustice,</v>

120
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.823
<v Speaker 1>then the pain of it would be distributed</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and we might get things done </v>

121
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:06.764
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality of standing up in terms of </v>

122
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>integrity is people often back away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

123
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:12.404
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have the personality or you </v>

124
00:07:13.491 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>have the resources and you have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>privilege so you can do this,</v>

125
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:16.874
<v Speaker 1>but I can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality of whistle blowing and </v>

126
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.970
<v Speaker 1>and doing exposing of injustice is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're often alone.</v>

127
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
