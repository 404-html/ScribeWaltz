1
00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.143
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>in the United States right now is many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have noticed that we are,</v>

3
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are seeing a huge escalation of our</v>

4
00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>long running culture war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

5
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 1>universities are right in the heart of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

6
00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right and especially right wing</v>

7
00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>media love to show video clips of</v>
<v Speaker 1>students saying outrageous things they</v>

8
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>love to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university is our bastions of</v>

9
00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>political correctness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've lost their minds.</v>

10
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>The left is motivated to say no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no not a problem.</v>

11
00:00:30.111 --> 00:00:33.170
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that the right hates ideas.</v>

12
00:00:33.171 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>They hate universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Greg and I do in the book is we</v>

13
00:00:37.191 --> 00:00:37.821
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

14
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:38.471
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

15
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>we're going to cut through the culture</v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

16
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Let's just look at what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at what a university should</v>

17
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.190
<v Speaker 1>and so when we talk about identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

19
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>which is a controversial topic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we start by saying,</v>

20
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>of course you need identity politics.</v>

21
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Identity politics is not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Automatically.</v>

22
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Politics can be based on any</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinction.</v>

23
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:05.651
<v Speaker 1>It can be based on any group interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for gay students or black students or</v>

24
00:01:05.781 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>women to organize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's identity politics,</v>

25
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:13.370
<v Speaker 1>that's perfectly legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is how are they organizing?</v>

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>What's the overarching framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen two versions of it in</v>

27
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>American history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it the way most of the civil</v>

28
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 1>rights leaders did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin Luther King in particular,</v>

29
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.680
<v Speaker 1>where you draw a larger circle around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the group,</v>

30
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you emphasize what we have in common and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you say some of our brothers and</v>

31
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>sisters are being denied equal access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equal opportunity or equal dignity.</v>

32
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.190
<v Speaker 1>That works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has worked historically in much</v>

33
00:01:37.191 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Speaker 1>tougher times and zones and that works</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll work on college campuses.</v>

34
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>The other way you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is growing on college campuses,</v>

35
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>is common enemy identity politics.</v>

36
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>It's based on the bed when notion me</v>
<v Speaker 1>against my brother,</v>

37
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>me and my brother against our cousin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and my brother and cousin against the</v>

38
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.560
<v Speaker 1>stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very general principle of social</v>

39
00:01:57.561 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>psychology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you try to unite people,</v>

40
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>let's all unite against them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're the bad people.</v>

41
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.780
<v Speaker 1>They are the cause of the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's all stick together.</v>

42
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>That's a really dangerous thing to do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a multiethnic society,</v>

43
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>especially in a university where we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually all trying to work together to</v>

44
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem we have to work on our</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech climate,</v>

45
00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the business world is called speak up</v>

46
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the academic world.</v>

47
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>It's called just basic openness to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

48
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>When you put people together and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want them to talk,</v>

49
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.670
<v Speaker 1>of course people have a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and fears.</v>

50
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to say something stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to say something.</v>

51
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 1>We'll get them into trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can create a really trusting</v>

52
00:02:39.501 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>environment in which we're all in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

53
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>contribute your ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If someone says something that you think</v>

54
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:45.770
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

55
00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>so that's going to lead to more</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

56
00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>That's gonna lead to more progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what if,</v>

57
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>what if you have an environment in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I say something that offends anyone,</v>

58
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 1>they can report me anonymously to hr or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other,</v>

59
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>some other entity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to think three times before I</v>

60
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>speak up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we have on campus.</v>

61
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the bathrooms at my university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are signs telling students had</v>

62
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>report me anonymously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I say anything that offends them,</v>

63
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>so I don't feel free to speak up when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm on campus,</v>

64
00:03:15.731 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I can speak more openly off campus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on campus,</v>

65
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I have to watch myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As one student said to a friend of mine,</v>

66
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>my motto is silence is safer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shut up and you won't get in</v>

67
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

68
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a terrible speech climate.</v>

69
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>A university cannot function if people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are defensive in this way.</v>

70
00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>So in universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in organizations that value innovation,</v>

72
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.810
<v Speaker 1>we have to not just encourage people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak.</v>

73
00:03:40.811 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>We have to assure them that they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be shamed,</v>

74
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 1>humiliated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or punished for sharing an opinion and</v>

75
00:03:45.731 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>good faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

76
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>we have a culture war raging all around</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

77
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy to take offense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are understandably angry here</v>

78
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>within these walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to put that aside.</v>

79
00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>We have to trust each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to give each of the benefit of</v>

80
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>the doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be good for all of us</v>

81
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>
