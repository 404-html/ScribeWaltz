00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>With next generation technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the ability to replace the</v>

2
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>petroleum we use today in our vehicles</v>
<v Speaker 1>with advanced biofuels.</v>

3
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Those technologies require years to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop and literally hundreds of</v>

4
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>millions of dollars of investment in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order for that investment to occur.</v>

5
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>In order for that R and d to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen,</v>

6
00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>there needs to be a conventional</v>
<v Speaker 1>biofuels industry from which to evolve.</v>

7
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>Today's conventional biofuels industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>provides exactly that platform and we</v>

8
00:00:34.131 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>anticipate over the next decade that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that transformation will occur and that</v>

9
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>next generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable biofuels will become the</v>

10
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>norm rather than the exception.</v>
