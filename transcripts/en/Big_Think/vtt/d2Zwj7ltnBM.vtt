1
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>Surrounds us so profound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 to 98 percent,</v>

2
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>that eight percent difference from thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>you read to the your raid is dark energy</v>

3
00:00:23.441 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>or dark matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what it is.</v>

4
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what 98 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe is and this wonderful man</v>

5
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Einstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this wonderful man who imagined the</v>

6
00:00:38.711 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>scientific theories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much like the Greeks who said,</v>

7
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you cut something in half,</v>

8
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>you've got to have the cut that half and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you keep going down the line.</v>

9
00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>You must come to the end and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll call it an Adam,</v>

10
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's how they made their</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific discoveries through the logic</v>

11
00:00:59.111 --> 00:01:04.111
<v Speaker 1>of imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas we have tools to dimly dimly see</v>

12
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.850
<v Speaker 1>into the physical nature dimly see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>

13
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a law.</v>

14
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something here that counteracts</v>

15
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:18.520
<v Speaker 1>that law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so just like our diets,</v>

16
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 1>the pyramid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrates,</v>

17
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.090
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day is 180 degrees reverse.</v>

18
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.601
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

19
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we meant was protein and a little</v>

20
00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.820
<v Speaker 1>bit of carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

21
00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 80 degrees different in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>

22
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening in science all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

23
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.450
<v Speaker 1>There's a wonderful line science</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientists spread rumors.</v>

24
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.170
<v Speaker 1>We know everything is unified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know if we use our imagination like</v>

25
00:01:50.171 --> 00:01:53.500
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we look around us and we say the whole</v>

26
00:01:53.501 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>world is unified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electrically.</v>

27
00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Adams thing matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's got to be a operating</v>

28
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>the thing that has to be managed in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

29
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>It's their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything follows a logic.</v>

30
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.100
<v Speaker 1>We had these little instruments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>peer into the universe.</v>

31
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing a SPEC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing a dust.</v>

32
00:02:18.041 --> 00:02:23.041
<v Speaker 1>Mote</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't the theory of everything.</v>

33
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you discover that as you die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe as you die,</v>

34
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:33.970
<v Speaker 1>you though there's the theory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

35
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.380
<v Speaker 1>Boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're dead.</v>
