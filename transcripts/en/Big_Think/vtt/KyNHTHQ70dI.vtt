1
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Laser cooling means shining light on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and making it cold.</v>

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Now that in itself sounds like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely backwards because after all,</v>

3
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>you typically think if you shine light</v>
<v Speaker 1>on something,</v>

4
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:16.620
<v Speaker 1>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get warm,</v>

5
00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>so how is it even possible to shine</v>
<v Speaker 1>light on something and make it cold to</v>

6
00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 1>cool the air down means to make those</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules,</v>

7
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>atoms in the air move more slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the difference between hot and</v>

8
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you make something cold with</v>

9
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>the laser?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>lasers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all light pushes on stuff.</v>

11
00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>There's a thing called radiation</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>White pushes on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've figured out to do over the</v>

13
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
<v Speaker 1>years is how to push on Adams in such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way as to make them slow down.</v>

14
00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 1>The thing that was perhaps the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowning achievement of the early</v>

15
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>days of laser cooling was the discovery</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we made in our laboratory that it</v>

16
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:09.021
<v Speaker 1>was possible to get these atoms colder</v>
<v Speaker 1>than everyone had thought was the limit</v>

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>to how cold you could get something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prediction said that we could get</v>

18
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:19.191
<v Speaker 1>down to temperatures of 240 millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a degree.</v>

19
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one quarter of 1000 of a degree above</v>

20
00:01:24.631 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>absolute zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty cold,</v>

21
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will in fact,</v>

22
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>we've got a whole lot colder than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the big breakthrough</v>

23
00:01:32.401 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>discovery that made a whole lot of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things possible.</v>

24
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all clocks have tickers.</v>

25
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.220
<v Speaker 1>All of these tickers have imperfections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every quartz crystal is made a little</v>

26
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>bit differently of the length of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>pendulum can change a little bit on that</v>

27
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>changes how fast it will swing back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

28
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So all of these clocks have</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfections and so one has throughout</v>

29
00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:03.201
<v Speaker 1>history been trying to make these clocks</v>
<v Speaker 1>better by making the tickers be more</v>

30
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>reliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is always had the same.</v>

31
00:02:07.621 --> 00:02:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Taking frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:14.001
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that atoms are the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice for making tickers that always</v>

33
00:02:14.071 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>take at the same frequency even Adams</v>
<v Speaker 1>have there,</v>

34
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imperfections.</v>

36
00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.870
<v Speaker 1>Temperature means that the atoms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving with a certain velocity,</v>

37
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>having a certain kinetic energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hotter the gas is,</v>

38
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.140
<v Speaker 1>the faster the atoms are moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so easy to measure the ticking</v>

39
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 1>frequency of something that's whizzing</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at the speed of sound.</v>

40
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>was facing with atomic clocks was the</v>

41
00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:45.630
<v Speaker 1>Adams are moving at approximately the</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed of sound and it wasn't so easy to</v>

42
00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>measure the taking frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we said,</v>

43
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>let's call them down using lasers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're going more slowly and that'll</v>

44
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:55.950
<v Speaker 1>make it easier to measure the taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency and you can make better</v>

45
00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 1>clocks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started doing laser cooling,</v>

46
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.150
<v Speaker 1>the very best clocks were accurate to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part in 10 to the 13th.</v>

47
00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's one part divided by one with</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 zero,</v>

48
00:03:06.851 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>zero effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the fractional error in how good</v>

49
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>that clock was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds incredible,</v>

50
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:16.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But today those clocks are a couple</v>

51
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>intended,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 16,</v>

52
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.370
<v Speaker 1>almost three orders of magnitude better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that has been made possible because</v>

53
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.280
<v Speaker 1>of laser cooling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that young children are</v>

54
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>curious about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And very early,</v>

55
00:03:35.901 --> 00:03:40.100
<v Speaker 1>my curiosity tended toward a curiosity</v>
<v Speaker 1>about science.</v>

56
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.490
<v Speaker 1>My parents got me a microscope when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very young,</v>

57
00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe six years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember looking at all kinds of</v>

58
00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:49.370
<v Speaker 1>things around the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.460
<v Speaker 1>with this microscope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember collecting various household,</v>

60
00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>chemicals and fluids to mix together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was my homemade chemistry set,</v>

62
00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 1>and in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was doing all the other things that</v>

63
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>kids do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>climb trees and uh,</v>

64
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scary up and down a cliffs and a</v>

65
00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.320
<v Speaker 1>clicked a huckleberries in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

66
00:04:15.321 --> 00:04:16.154
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was always a lot of physical</v>

68
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:21.590
<v Speaker 1>activity and a lot of that physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity for me involved,</v>

69
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing things that,</v>

70
00:04:22.851 --> 00:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that related to science,</v>

71
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.780
<v Speaker 1>looking at stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being curious,</v>

72
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.610
<v Speaker 1>curious about the natural world.</v>

73
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a really interesting question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

74
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.110
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly the answer isn't simple.</v>

75
00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:43.300
<v Speaker 1>The simple answer is no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now I've got to explain why I'm</v>

76
00:04:43.301 --> 00:04:48.301
<v Speaker 1>saying that the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer is that every process for</v>

77
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:53.521
<v Speaker 1>cooling either also introduces the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility that you can introduce some</v>

78
00:04:56.621 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>extra energy into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

79
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>cooling means taking energy out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>heating means putting energy in.</v>

80
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.640
<v Speaker 1>But in order to take energy out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it turns out that you opened the</v>

81
00:05:06.641 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>door for energy to go in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take laser cooling.</v>

82
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Laser cooling takes the energy out by</v>
<v Speaker 1>having an Adam coming along.</v>

83
00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And then a photon hits the atom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>slows the Adam down.</v>

84
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Then that photon has to go someplace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that photon is shot out by the</v>

85
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>atom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the atom recoils and more energy goes</v>

86
00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a balance between the cooling</v>

87
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:32.290
<v Speaker 1>and the heating and you can try to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that balance work more and more in your</v>

88
00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>favor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can never make it work.</v>

89
00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>One hundred percent cooling and no</v>
<v Speaker 1>heating.</v>

90
00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the reasons why you</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't expect to ever get to absolute</v>

91
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

92
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean to be an absolute</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero?</v>

93
00:05:44.201 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>It means that all the thermal motion</v>
<v Speaker 1>stops.</v>

94
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take one,</v>

95
00:05:49.391 --> 00:05:54.391
<v Speaker 1>Adam and I can take as much energy out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it as possible so that it's in what</v>

96
00:05:57.861 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>we would call the ground state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lowest possible state of energy.</v>

97
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Is it absolute zero?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really,</v>

98
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>because in order to be at absolute zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have to have a whole bundle of</v>

99
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't really talk easily about the</v>

100
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>temperature of a single object.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should really talk about a whole</v>

101
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.420
<v Speaker 1>ensemble and if I do that with a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch of atoms,</v>

102
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is maybe if I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>lucky,</v>

103
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe 99 percent of them are going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the ground state and then one percent</v>

104
00:06:23.451 --> 00:06:25.370
<v Speaker 1>isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not absolute zero.</v>

105
00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>I can't come up with any procedure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to say 100 percent of the time</v>

106
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.170
<v Speaker 1>this Adam's going to end up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ground state and that's what I would</v>

107
00:06:33.171 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>need to be able to claim that I'd really</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten to absolute zero,</v>

108
00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get so close to absolute zero that</v>

109
00:06:41.631 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>for many experiments it's basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely zero for all practical</v>

110
00:06:46.161 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not for all experiments and we're</v>

111
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>constantly working on trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>things colder because for some</v>

112
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 1>experiments it really matters that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not quite there.</v>

113
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my reaction to hearing about the Nobel</v>

114
00:07:00.471 --> 00:07:05.471
<v Speaker 1>prize was one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a shock and disbelief.</v>

115
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.440
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember very,</v>

116
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>very well when this happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was attending a meeting in California</v>

117
00:07:13.101 --> 00:07:16.430
<v Speaker 1>meeting of the American Physical Society</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Optical Society of America</v>

118
00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>meeting jointly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a out in California in Long Beach,</v>

119
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:24.200
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the day before the prizes were</v>

120
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>announced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a number of us were sitting around after</v>

121
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>the scientific sessions were over</v>
<v Speaker 1>speculating about who was going to get</v>

122
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>the Nobel prize that year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>

123
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:36.410
<v Speaker 1>nobody brought up my name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

124
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.540
<v Speaker 1>so later that night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

125
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>it was the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:45.010
<v Speaker 1>that I got a call in my hotel room to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effect that I had a shared the Nobel</v>

127
00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.230
<v Speaker 1>prize with quad cone to new egg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Steve Chu came as a complete shock.</v>

128
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>My life changed dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:01.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult for me to keep up</v>

130
00:08:01.161 --> 00:08:05.900
<v Speaker 1>with all of the invitations that I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to speak about my work.</v>

131
00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size of my research group has,</v>

132
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.590
<v Speaker 1>has grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's made it possible for me to be</v>

133
00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:15.770
<v Speaker 1>involved in more and more new kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>

134
00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.300
<v Speaker 1>But it's made it harder and harder for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to be intimately familiar with all</v>

135
00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.250
<v Speaker 1>the things that are going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of a,</v>

136
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:27.450
<v Speaker 1>of a tension between the joy in doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of new things and the desire to</v>

137
00:08:28.221 --> 00:08:30.830
<v Speaker 1>understand them better and better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

138
00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:35.790
<v Speaker 1>another thing that I never would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagined would have been a,</v>

139
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the results of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

140
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:45.050
<v Speaker 1>becoming a Nobel laureate is that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended up meeting people who are actually</v>

141
00:08:45.051 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

142
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:48.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

143
00:08:48.711 --> 00:08:49.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Nobel laureate,</v>

144
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.540
<v Speaker 1>you must be famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

145
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>nobody remembers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:08:52.581 --> 00:08:57.581
<v Speaker 1>outside of the field in which working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody remembers who won the Nobel prize</v>

147
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>a even a couple of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

148
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>but as a result of being a Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 1>laureate,</v>

149
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I get invited to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 1>to things where I've met people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually famous.</v>

151
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.840
<v Speaker 1>One of the people that I have met who</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been most charming,</v>

152
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Dr Ruth Westheimer.</v>

153
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.390
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she lives in New York City and uh,</v>

154
00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Speaker 1>I see her probably about once a year and</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just a wonderfully warm and</v>

155
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.650
<v Speaker 1>genuine person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just,</v>

156
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:33.780
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a joy to know as a friend.</v>

157
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.041
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

158
00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>I should say that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not particularly comfortable with</v>

159
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:45.180
<v Speaker 1>being described as a religious person</v>
<v Speaker 1>because somehow I have this image in my</v>

160
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>mind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of somebody who's who's very proper and</v>

161
00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>prim and follows all sorts of rituals</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff.</v>

162
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

163
00:09:54.261 --> 00:09:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I liked rather to describe myself as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>person of faith.</v>

164
00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:59.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

165
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.670
<v Speaker 1>clearly I don't believe that science has</v>
<v Speaker 1>made belief in God obsolete or else I</v>

166
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't describe myself as a person of</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith.</v>

167
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that certain ways of</v>

168
00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:18.770
<v Speaker 1>interpreting a certain scriptures have</v>
<v Speaker 1>been made obsolete by science,</v>

169
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:24.140
<v Speaker 1>but that in no way makes religious faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>or belief in God obsolete.</v>

170
00:10:24.141 --> 00:10:28.230
<v Speaker 1>It just requires what I would consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a,</v>

171
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.230
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different outlook of maturation of</v>

172
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>religious faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if we look at the history of</v>

173
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:38.550
<v Speaker 1>religious faith as told in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scriptures and as seen throughout</v>

174
00:10:38.551 --> 00:10:42.030
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the entire history of faith has</v>

175
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:47.031
<v Speaker 1>been one of a maturation of that faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see it not so much as people becoming</v>

176
00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:54.081
<v Speaker 1>more mature in their faith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but God challenging people to become</v>

177
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.040
<v Speaker 1>more mature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a clear understanding of what God</v>

178
00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:04.041
<v Speaker 1>wants for humankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think God is always pushing us to</v>

179
00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 1>be better than what we are.</v>

180
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's two ways of answering that</v>

181
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:17.301
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By and large science and religion deal</v>

182
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:22.701
<v Speaker 1>with different kinds of questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Science deals with questions about how</v>

183
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.850
<v Speaker 1>things come to be the way they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How should I think about the way things</v>

184
00:11:26.851 --> 00:11:29.760
<v Speaker 1>are?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How shall I organize my understanding of</v>

185
00:11:29.761 --> 00:11:34.590
<v Speaker 1>the way things behave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas religion deals with questions</v>

186
00:11:34.591 --> 00:11:38.790
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how should I behave toward my fellow</v>

187
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.080
<v Speaker 1>human creatures?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should my relationship be to God?</v>

188
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:48.081
<v Speaker 1>How should I understand the ultimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>origins of this world in this universe</v>

189
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.960
<v Speaker 1>in which we live is a very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of questions,</v>

190
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:57.110
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes the areas that science</v>
<v Speaker 1>addresses and the areas that our</v>

191
00:11:57.881 --> 00:12:02.881
<v Speaker 1>religion addresses can overlap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't ascribe to the idea of</v>

192
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.480
<v Speaker 1>science and religion as being non</v>
<v Speaker 1>overlapping.</v>

193
00:12:07.481 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Magisterial has sometimes been</v>
<v Speaker 1>described,</v>

194
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:15.660
<v Speaker 1>but I also will say that by and large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they deal with different kinds of</v>

195
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:20.380
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are ethical questions that</v>

196
00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:25.381
<v Speaker 1>might involve things like medical ethics</v>
<v Speaker 1>or environmental questions where you</v>

197
00:12:25.601 --> 00:12:30.340
<v Speaker 1>have to understand the science in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be able to make good ethical</v>

198
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:32.710
<v Speaker 1>decisions that are guided by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious principles.</v>

199
00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>So there's always going to be places</v>
<v Speaker 1>where science and religion are gonna</v>

200
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.850
<v Speaker 1>come to bear on the same kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems</v>

201
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.180
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

202
00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:50.050
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the greatest things about</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a scientist is that you're</v>

203
00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:55.051
<v Speaker 1>continually surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature is so much more clever than we</v>

204
00:12:55.181 --> 00:13:00.181
<v Speaker 1>are that we never understand the secrets</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nature has to has to offer.</v>

205
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>But little by little we learned more and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

206
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:07.630
<v Speaker 1>but every time we go into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratory,</v>

207
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:11.950
<v Speaker 1>we're surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work in an area of physics,</v>

208
00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 1>atomic physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the basic principles,</v>

209
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:19.180
<v Speaker 1>as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic principles were pretty much</v>

210
00:13:19.181 --> 00:13:24.181
<v Speaker 1>understood in the 19 thirties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe some details were worked out in</v>

211
00:13:24.431 --> 00:13:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the forties and fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are still surprised everyday by</v>

212
00:13:28.781 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 1>the results of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

213
00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:33.100
<v Speaker 1>So in spite of the fact that some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>might say,</v>

214
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:34.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing new,</v>

215
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:39.100
<v Speaker 1>we're surprised every day and the things</v>
<v Speaker 1>we learned were things that nobody</v>

216
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.410
<v Speaker 1>imagined that things would work this</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

217
00:13:41.411 --> 00:13:44.290
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to this example about</v>

218
00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:44.890
<v Speaker 1>laser cooling.</v>

219
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thought they understood how</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold you could get things using laser</v>

220
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:53.430
<v Speaker 1>cooling and the problem was as simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough problem,</v>

221
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>you can write down the proof and in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>few minutes as to how cold is possible,</v>

222
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.590
<v Speaker 1>get something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we got it eventually,</v>

223
00:13:59.591 --> 00:14:02.500
<v Speaker 1>200 times colder for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one particular item.</v>

224
00:14:02.501 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 1>Then the theory said was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

225
00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:06.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the situation was a little bit</v>

226
00:14:06.941 --> 00:14:09.790
<v Speaker 1>more complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember I said that physicists like to,</v>

227
00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a problem really simple.</v>

228
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.320
<v Speaker 1>That's the physicist way of looking at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

229
00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein once said,</v>

230
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.430
<v Speaker 1>a problem should be made as simple as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

231
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:22.270
<v Speaker 1>but no simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes you make a mistake and</v>

232
00:14:22.271 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>you'll leave out some really important</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

233
00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Usually when you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes things worse.</v>

234
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:33.040
<v Speaker 1>This was a case where putting in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>complications made things work better.</v>

235
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would have guessed that that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna happen.</v>

236
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine anybody sitting down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

237
00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure out how laser</v>

238
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 1>cooling works and coming up with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happens.</v>

239
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.240
<v Speaker 1>We had to do the experiments first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nature showed us what was,</v>

240
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.630
<v Speaker 1>what was gonna happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then clever people figured out what</v>

241
00:14:52.631 --> 00:14:53.620
<v Speaker 1>was really going on.</v>

242
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Kinds of surprises happen to us all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
