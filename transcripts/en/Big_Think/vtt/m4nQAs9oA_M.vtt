00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.450
<v Speaker 1>I remember the first search engines came</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and back then Alta Vista was a</v>

2
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 1>very big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll try to strike a balance between the</v>

3
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:18.300
<v Speaker 1>inconveniences in terms of advertising</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so on.</v>

4
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>They could put on the user and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>utility had for the users,</v>

5
00:00:21.681 --> 00:00:22.411
<v Speaker 1>so it would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

6
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>mixed search results with advertising</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at this point Google came along.</v>

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Google was very small and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inconsequential and nobody really took</v>

8
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>it seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it did an amazing thing.</v>

9
00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.980
<v Speaker 1>It did give people exactly what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

10
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>It give them a pretty much ad free</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

11
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>I gave them exactly the search result</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they wanted,</v>

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the best one's closest ones to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>people wanted to have.</v>

13
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.020
<v Speaker 1>Google dramatically outperformed Alta</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vista,</v>

14
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Altavista disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was an amazing insight to see</v>

15
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.540
<v Speaker 1>that if you are in a dramatically</v>
<v Speaker 1>scalable economy like the Internet for</v>

16
00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>you have the biggest amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition that you can possibly have.</v>

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Speaker 1>You need to build a product that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>optimally aligned with the interests of</v>

18
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>the users unless you manage to get some</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of monopoly and can drive out all</v>

19
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>the competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when we build new products in</v>

20
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>that space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to think about how to build the</v>

21
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>most useful product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily just the product that is</v>

22
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>going to make the biggest amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that is going to have the most</v>

23
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>efficient business model in some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the best business case.</v>

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Eventually it's going to be the product</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is getting the most used by people</v>

25
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>and people will find out that they will</v>
<v Speaker 1>use most what is most useful to them in</v>

26
00:01:34.531 --> 00:01:36.330
<v Speaker 1>the long run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the staff that is not</v>

27
00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>addictive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hygienic,</v>

28
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that serves the actual needs that makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>them more happy and fulfilled.</v>

29
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And right now we mostly build</v>
<v Speaker 1>applications that utilize the cravings</v>

30
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>of people that make them addicted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People start checking their smartphones</v>

31
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>every few seconds to see if a new email</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived,</v>

32
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.970
<v Speaker 1>but this new email is not going to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>them more happy and fulfilled is instead</v>

33
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>it takes survey their attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe the next big movement in</v>

34
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>how we built technical systems will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>hygienic technology.</v>

35
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>It will be how to build systems that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful with our attention,</v>

36
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>how we use it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is careful of is our way of</v>

37
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 1>living and what we want to achieve is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tools that we are building.</v>
