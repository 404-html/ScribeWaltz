WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>That is used in many ways and in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>spiritual life</v>

2
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>fascination that we have for food and</v>
<v Speaker 1>for taste is can be a very wonderful and</v>

3
00:00:21.191 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>exciting adventure in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it can also be a distraction from</v>

4
00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>the important work of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the tastes and sights and sounds of</v>

5
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>the world are the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're wonderful,</v>

6
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 1>they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be celebrated.</v>

7
00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:43.561
<v Speaker 1>we can use things like restraint and</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet as a way to give us more time and</v>

9
00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 1>energy to concentrate on more</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossibly,</v>

10
00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:48.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>things that we wouldn't neglect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>in our lives through the easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>distractions,</v>

13
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>the sights and sounds of the world of</v>
<v Speaker 1>which food is,</v>

14
00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>is one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the word in Sanskrit is taught or a</v>

15
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.340
<v Speaker 1>steroidy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

16
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you try to simplify your diet to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>it to the lowest common denominators so</v>

17
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>that it would be nutritious.</v>

18
00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.820
<v Speaker 1>That's one aspect of diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another aspect of diet that is the most</v>

19
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:23.581
<v Speaker 1>important aspect of diet for the Yogi is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you trying to remove all the</v>

20
00:01:24.401 --> 00:01:29.401
<v Speaker 1>violence from your diet so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>no one suffered so that your plate could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be full and that you are grateful that,</v>

22
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you obtain this food with the least</v>

23
00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 1>amount of suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each one of us causes suffering just by</v>

24
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>being on this earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.050
<v Speaker 1>when we just innocently step our foot</v>
<v Speaker 1>down on the sidewalk,</v>

26
00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:57.400
<v Speaker 1>we're stepping on many microorganisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>that weren't hurting us at all.</v>

27
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Just trying to establish little</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities.</v>

28
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the,</v>

29
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>in the sidewalk and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.210
<v Speaker 1>so a Yogi tries to be conscious of every</v>
<v Speaker 1>step in that way so that we wouldn't</v>

31
00:02:09.341 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 1>cause unnecessary harm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same is true for diet.</v>

32
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the things that get to our plate</v>

33
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:21.811
<v Speaker 1>gets get there only through a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and deprivation.</v>

34
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.313
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>so a Yogi tries to remove that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.550
<v Speaker 1>that if you take the sentient beings out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your diet,</v>

38
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>that is if you eat a vegan diet where no</v>
<v Speaker 1>animal products are included,</v>

39
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>you're taking a large chunk of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering that you've caused out of your</v>

40
00:02:44.591 --> 00:02:49.591
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that removal of a selfish path in</v>

41
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

42
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness of how your choices impact</v>

43
00:02:56.381 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>others changes you and it also the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you.</v>

44
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>It's quite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
