1
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>Hiring is as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as important as any other thing you</v>

2
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>could possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And probably if not the hardest,</v>

3
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>one of the hardest things to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>can you really get the full measure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's in a,</v>

6
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six meetings,</v>

7
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>which would be extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get the full measure of that</v>

9
00:00:28.141 --> 00:00:30.390
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't you understand how that person</v>

10
00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>will operate within your environment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

11
00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause just because somebody comes in and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fail,</v>

12
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a failure or a bad executive.</v>

13
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>It just might be that their personality</v>
<v Speaker 1>or their expertise didn't match,</v>

14
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the job of the community you put them</v>

15
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>

16
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:47.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

17
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:49.550
<v Speaker 1>very important to do the best he can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>to recognize the fact that it might not</v>
<v Speaker 1>always work out to be as,</v>

19
00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as understanding about those times as</v>

20
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you are about the times when it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>work out.</v>

21
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>

22
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurture your people and train your</v>

23
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>people as much as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:01:03.091 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>there's been a change and although I</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a change,</v>

25
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>again given the recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but go into the recession,</v>

26
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a change in perception,</v>

27
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I think about how people graduated</v>
<v Speaker 1>college and came into the workforce.</v>

28
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

29
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.200
<v Speaker 1>some said that they must pant pamper</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation ever that,</v>

31
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

32
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 1>the baby boom generation was used to not</v>
<v Speaker 1>having a particularly huge amount of</v>

33
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>nurturing and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tender loving care and so over,</v>

34
00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compensated for that.</v>

35
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And there are children where the benefit</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

36
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.730
<v Speaker 1>so they're probably the most adjusted</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>

37
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have a very clear understanding</v>

38
00:01:41.191 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>that there's a work life balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God forbid.</v>

39
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

40
00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>it makes it more difficult for them on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one hand to come into a institutions</v>

41
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>that perhaps don't value that and quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way that they do the other</v>

42
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it very difficult for the</v>

43
00:01:56.671 --> 00:02:01.671
<v Speaker 1>organizations to understand exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's motivating this next generation.</v>

44
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>So you've got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>generational issue intertwined with</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else that's,</v>

46
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>that's gone on in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

47
00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:08.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

48
00:02:08.341 --> 00:02:09.174
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

49
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.610
<v Speaker 1>a one silver bolt solution that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not,</v>

50
00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.900
<v Speaker 1>but being aware of that and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that and,</v>

51
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>and helping folks on both sides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>move through that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 1>that process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:22.290
<v Speaker 1>I think is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is is,</v>

55
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>is a necessary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

56
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I think there's ways to get people over</v>
<v Speaker 1>that hump that it's not all about,</v>

57
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything helping you win</v>

58
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and get organizations to understand that</v>

59
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>there might need to be a little more</v>
<v Speaker 1>helping new people when,</v>

60
00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and once you get past that initial</v>

61
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>foray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have some very,</v>

62
00:02:44.191 --> 00:02:45.300
<v Speaker 1>very effective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good,</v>

63
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>

64
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I think I,</v>

65
00:02:50.731 --> 00:02:55.731
<v Speaker 1>I should mention here is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the core thoughts that we go into</v>

66
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>employee interactions with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and that is the notion that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody is coming to work,</v>

68
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as at the end has a top of the list.</v>

69
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:09.040
<v Speaker 1>The reason they're going to work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with the level of the</v>

70
00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.830
<v Speaker 1>They're going to work because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.800
<v Speaker 1>they want to feed themselves and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

73
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the first priority.</v>

74
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>The second priority is they're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>work because they want to improve their</v>

75
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.590
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't able to feed and clothe and</v>

76
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>take care of their families better and</v>
<v Speaker 1>better and better as they move along.</v>

77
00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the third reason they're going to</v>

78
00:03:29.021 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>work is so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they enjoy this better than they enjoy</v>

79
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I can be,</v>

80
00:03:32.891 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>or the company can be the fourth reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a really good thing.</v>

81
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>And understanding that and being up</v>
<v Speaker 1>front about it,</v>

82
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>I think is also really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It allows a more honest set of</v>

83
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:47.980
<v Speaker 1>communications and of course allows you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the conversation about,</v>

84
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:48.371
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

85
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>the reason that we all want to succeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that by succeeding together,</v>

86
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>we're all succeed more by succeeding</v>
<v Speaker 1>individually.</v>

87
00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll all succeed less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So succeeding together you will a,</v>

88
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>make more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

89
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.360
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>a better credential and move forward in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your career with and see,</v>

91
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>have a lot more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of your three first things will</v>

93
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>basically be addressed.</v>
