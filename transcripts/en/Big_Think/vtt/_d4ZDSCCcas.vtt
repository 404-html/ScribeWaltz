1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.200
<v Speaker 1>One of the economic and cultural changes</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've seen pretty dramatically in</v>

2
00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.150
<v Speaker 1>the last few decades is the sheriff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lung,</v>

3
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.320
<v Speaker 1>young adults who never leave home even</v>
<v Speaker 1>after they go through their schooling or</v>

4
00:00:10.321 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>at some point in their young lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boomerang back home.</v>

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>And we estimate that more than 40%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly half of all millennials have</v>

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:18.660
<v Speaker 1>either never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never left,</v>

7
00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>never launched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will or at some point have</v>

8
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:23.520
<v Speaker 1>boomeranged back home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

9
00:00:23.521 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>he can't find a job if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're underemployed,</v>

10
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're at a non nonpaying internship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those sorts of journeys,</v>

11
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>a mom and dad's home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ain't bad place to hang out.</v>

12
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the refrigerator is usually stocked and</v>

13
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to put coins in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>laundry.</v>

14
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I think there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my generation,</v>

16
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 1>there was some stigma attached to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on with your life already ready for</v>

18
00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:47.724
<v Speaker 1>goodness sake.</v>

19
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've done some surveying of both the</v>

20
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>parents have such young adults and young</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults themselves looking for tension</v>

21
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>within those homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for conflict,</v>

22
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:58.290
<v Speaker 1>looking for stigma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And frankly,</v>

23
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.840
<v Speaker 1>we don't find that much in part because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has,</v>

24
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>it has become more commonplace and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sort of understand.</v>

25
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.854
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

26
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

27
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that's the nature of the slow passage</v>
<v Speaker 1>into adulthood.</v>

28
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>there are societies in the world and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a southern Europe,</v>

30
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>particularly Italy come to mind where</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally young men have been living</v>

31
00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>with their mothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in into their thirties and forties.</v>

33
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>A bum bocce on is big baby and mommy smo</v>
<v Speaker 1>his mamma's boy.</v>

34
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>And some of this is cultural,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>as some of this is clearly economic and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Europe frankly has the same</v>

36
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>challenges with not enough jobs for</v>
<v Speaker 1>young adults that we have.</v>

37
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.030
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of the world is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

38
00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>is going through this.</v>

39
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the silver lining is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there don't seem to be a lot of</v>

40
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 1>stresses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

41
00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.590
<v Speaker 1>I speak as a baby boomer who came of age</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties and there was a whiff of</v>

42
00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:55.080
<v Speaker 1>generation war in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a time when there was a,</v>

43
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:55.981 --> 00:01:58.350
<v Speaker 1>there's a women's rights movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights movement,</v>

45
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.950
<v Speaker 1>anti war protests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a feeling that the older</v>

46
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 1>generation had screwed everything up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>thank God w here we were to make</v>

47
00:02:05.941 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>everything right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was almost a sort of a finger of</v>

48
00:02:07.981 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>accusation pointed at the older</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

49
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>You see virtually none of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within the younger generation.</v>

51
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.670
<v Speaker 1>In some ways I have a sense from our</v>
<v Speaker 1>surveys,</v>

52
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that young adults have sort of</v>

53
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:24.630
<v Speaker 1>seamlessly migrated from being the</v>
<v Speaker 1>children to their parents in many cases</v>

54
00:02:24.631 --> 00:02:28.340
<v Speaker 1>to being the roommates or their parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have the similar interests and</v>

55
00:02:28.341 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>they text each other and they get on</v>
<v Speaker 1>with their lives and there's a certain</v>

56
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.810
<v Speaker 1>sort of resilience there.</v>

57
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a snapshot of a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:02:36.931 --> 00:02:39.660
<v Speaker 1>in this slower passage to adulthood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I again,</v>

59
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we yet know fast</v>
<v Speaker 1>forwarding a a decade or two down the</v>

60
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>what that will mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what that will mean for the family</v>

62
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:52.350
<v Speaker 1>formations of these young adults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect what it does mean is that the</v>

63
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>intergenerational interdependence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see in these families is likely to</v>

64
00:02:56.551 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>last a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no question that families stay</v>

65
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:03.050
<v Speaker 1>closer to each other father into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

66
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 1>Then may have been the case in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when we talk about generational</v>

67
00:03:06.791 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>personalities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's acknowledge upfront we are deep</v>

68
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>into the realm of generalization and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotype and there within any</v>

69
00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there as many differences between</v>

70
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:19.360
<v Speaker 1>individuals as there are across</v>
<v Speaker 1>generations.</v>

71
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that if you're born in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

72
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>you're a member of one generation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore have one part of a</v>

73
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you were born a year later,</v>

74
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you're or another generation that flies</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the face of common sense,</v>

75
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:31.410
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

76
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Have you said that you can look at broad</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and we can see this with our</v>

77
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>attitudinal data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our voting behavior or economic</v>

78
00:03:37.841 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

79
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting the caveat that these are big</v>

80
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.000
<v Speaker 1>generalizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number of things that do</v>

82
00:03:45.911 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>stand out in terms of the person persona</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this generation.</v>

83
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.750
<v Speaker 1>One of them is awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.160
<v Speaker 1>there was a classic question in social</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

85
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what we call social trust.</v>

86
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>And the question goes very simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>

87
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>would you say most people can be trusted</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you can't be too careful when you're</v>

88
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>dealing with other people?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:07.750
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pew Research Center and other</v>

90
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 1>research organizations have been asking</v>
<v Speaker 1>this question for 40 years and we've</v>

91
00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:16.681
<v Speaker 1>never seen a generation that is as low</v>
<v Speaker 1>on social trust as millennials are.</v>

92
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>So only about 19% of millennials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time we asked this question</v>

93
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:20.861
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

94
00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>most people can be trusted.</v>

95
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting finding because</v>

96
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>millennials are also a play nicely with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

97
00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a generation.</v>

98
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>we all got that report card in</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindergarten plays nicely with others.</v>

100
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I think millennials must have all done</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well on that.</v>

101
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 1>How do you square these two seemingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite characteristics?</v>

102
00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

103
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let me,</v>

104
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>let me put forward a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting theories to start with.</v>

105
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:54.590
<v Speaker 1>The social trust finding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that a sociologist no</v>

106
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:59.670
<v Speaker 1>and psychologists have observed is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a population groups within a population,</v>

107
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feel vulnerable for whatever</v>

108
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:06.550
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to be low on social trust because</v>

109
00:05:06.551 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>they're not well fortified to deal with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of misplaced trust.</v>

110
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.990
<v Speaker 1>So if you think about the millennial</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation and you think about their</v>

111
00:05:13.991 --> 00:05:16.220
<v Speaker 1>demographic characteristics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>a large share are nonwhite and a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>share at the lower end of the</v>

113
00:05:19.721 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic scale.</v>

114
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.720
<v Speaker 1>In both cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.930
<v Speaker 1>that places them or may place them in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

116
00:05:25.931 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>in an attitude of vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

117
00:05:28.681 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>and therefore you can't be too careful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible that the fact that</v>

118
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>they navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do so much of their social</v>

119
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:37.950
<v Speaker 1>interaction online may lead to</v>
<v Speaker 1>awareness.</v>

120
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing to have a face to face</v>

121
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>friends and those sorts of relationships</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you can,</v>

122
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>you have a history of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can read body language,</v>

123
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>you can do all the things that friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to do when you have relationships</v>

124
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that are entirely mediated through an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through an online setting.</v>

125
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more complicated and I think people</v>

126
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>come around the view they'd not</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's exactly who they say they</v>

127
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:00.321
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

128
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

129
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.090
<v Speaker 1>a final possibility is the way then the</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nurturing parenting norms,</v>

130
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that raised millennials.</v>

131
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Millennials came of age in the nineties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and arts,</v>

132
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an era of global terrorism,</v>

133
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of domestic school shootings.</v>

134
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>Columbine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine 11,</v>

135
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>not a pretty horrible things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly disturbing to parents.</v>

136
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worry about strangers online,</v>

137
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.820
<v Speaker 1>online predators and all the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social psychologists would say that they</v>

138
00:06:32.821 --> 00:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>have been raised in a very protective</v>
<v Speaker 1>nurturing environment.</v>

139
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:39.570
<v Speaker 1>It is a kind of an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody gets a trophy quality to the</v>

140
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:42.150
<v Speaker 1>way millennials have been raised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your precious,</v>

141
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.450
<v Speaker 1>it's a mean and difficult world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to protect you,</v>

142
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 1>which may then be picked up by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the children raised this way.</v>

143
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:52.200
<v Speaker 1>As you better be careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better be wary.</v>

144
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:53.461
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

145
00:06:53.461 --> 00:06:54.930
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't push this too far,</v>

146
00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:59.430
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one real world consequence that is</v>

147
00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>already observable among the millennials</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in their economic behaviors.</v>

148
00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>They appeared to be a risk averse</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

149
00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe that's because they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have money.</v>

150
00:07:08.581 --> 00:07:12.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't have the economic security</v>
<v Speaker 1>that leads to a freedom to take risks.</v>

151
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.530
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe,</v>

152
00:07:13.531 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's the way they've been raised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but w w w one of the data points is a,</v>

153
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fidelity and other companies that manage</v>

154
00:07:21.781 --> 00:07:23.910
<v Speaker 1>401k's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

155
00:07:23.911 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and kind of have a sense of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment ha habits and patterns of</v>

156
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>millions and millions of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

157
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>have noticed in the last five or six</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that the young adults in these,</v>

158
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:38.730
<v Speaker 1>in these 401k programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they look at their investment</v>

159
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 1>choices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

160
00:07:40.291 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:07:41.251 --> 00:07:43.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advice to the young adults is the,</v>

162
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.341
<v Speaker 1>a little bit you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

163
00:07:44.341 --> 00:07:45.570
<v Speaker 1>you're young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have time,</v>

164
00:07:45.571 --> 00:07:46.860
<v Speaker 1>be aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:49.950
<v Speaker 1>a stock portfolio over the long haul of</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to do better,</v>

166
00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:50.790
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

167
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many young adults are not taking that</v>

168
00:07:53.041 --> 00:07:54.930
<v Speaker 1>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you can see that in their</v>

169
00:07:54.931 --> 00:07:57.300
<v Speaker 1>consumption habits as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

170
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.600
<v Speaker 1>either because they don't have the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>or they don't want to take on the debt.</v>

171
00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:02.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not buying cars.</v>

172
00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 1>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find houses.</v>

173
00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think there is a kind of wariness</v>

174
00:08:06.931 --> 00:08:09.990
<v Speaker 1>that cuts across a lot of dimensions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their lives.</v>
