00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I would advise anyone including myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>that any moment you are,</v>

2
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you understand your life is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then everything that's led up to it was</v>

3
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I say that,</v>

4
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not that I haven't laid mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd made some glorious mistakes and I</v>

5
00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 1>suffered in my life for those mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sitting here talking to you this</v>

6
00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.970
<v Speaker 1>morning and my world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am too concerned with the,</v>

7
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problems.</v>

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in trailer parks everywhere.</v>

9
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 1>But in my personal world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't be happier.</v>

10
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I have six kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They delight me thoroughly and they are</v>

11
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:55.561
<v Speaker 1>all very close with one another and our</v>
<v Speaker 1>family get togethers at the best thing</v>

12
00:00:55.901 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>going in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I figure</v>

13
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>if I can say that at this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel that at this moment it wouldn't</v>

14
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:09.460
<v Speaker 1>change anything that got me here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>all of the mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the drama,</v>

16
00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:16.741
<v Speaker 1>all of the bullshit that went on earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>that so much of which I was responsible</v>

17
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:19.414
<v Speaker 1>for.</v>

18
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.290
<v Speaker 1>If the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the moment you're at is a great</v>

19
00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>moment and you're happy for who you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this moment,</v>

20
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>that everything that got you here is</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile because it's all gone.</v>

21
00:01:30.011 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>That's yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two,</v>

22
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>two of the most important words I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>are over in next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When somebody is over,</v>

24
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.750
<v Speaker 1>it is over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're all onto the next and the</v>

25
00:01:46.751 --> 00:01:51.751
<v Speaker 1>hammock in the middle between those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>words is what I think is meant by truly</v>

26
00:01:53.771 --> 00:01:56.450
<v Speaker 1>living in the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 1>when I get it from this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's greatest was</v>

28
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>there ain't anything I can do if I wish</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fix or change or I've done it next.</v>

29
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>So I think being invested in next and</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the past,</v>

30
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:16.690
<v Speaker 1>it's best.</v>
