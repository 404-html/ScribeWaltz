1
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>There've been three big changes in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>family in the last generation.</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definition of the family has</v>

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we now have adoptive families,</v>

4
00:00:08.431 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>blended families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear families living in separate</v>

5
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>houses and divorced families living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same house.</v>

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have women have flooded into the</v>

7
00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>workplace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thirds of women now work outside of</v>

8
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.900
<v Speaker 1>the home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the last thing which we don't talk</v>

9
00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:25.290
<v Speaker 1>about as much is that men have come</v>
<v Speaker 1>flooding into the parenting space and</v>

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>dads are much more involved in families</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this new generation of</v>

11
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they are much more active and</v>

12
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 1>much busier technology work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. They're much more interested in</v>

13
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>solutions so that the old debates be</v>
<v Speaker 1>strict,</v>

14
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>like the Chinese are blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the French are no longer satisfying</v>

15
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want results,</v>

16
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>they want to know what works and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be able to do it in their</v>

17
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:49.734
<v Speaker 1>families.</v>

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm the father of identical twin girls</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my wife works and we were incredibly</v>

19
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.170
<v Speaker 1>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just felt lost and out of control.</v>

20
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>We would turn to our parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their experience was so outdated as</v>

21
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>to be almost quaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd facebook our friends,</v>

22
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:09.411
<v Speaker 1>but they're just as clueless as we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then we went looking for results and</v>

23
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Speaker 1>the traditional solutions just seemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>very tired and out of date and yet at</v>

24
00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>the same time that these family experts</v>
<v Speaker 1>were telling us the same thing over and</v>

25
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>over again in every other area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>contemporary life,</v>

26
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>from business to sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the military,</v>

27
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>there's all these new ideas about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make teams and groups work more</v>

28
00:01:30.391 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>effectively and so I wanted to go out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what those folks were doing in</v>

29
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>their homes and then test those ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with my own wife and kids and my</v>

30
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>wife put one red line in the sand.</v>

31
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

32
00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I'm willing to try new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm desperate,</v>

33
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want some academic telling me</v>

34
00:01:45.841 --> 00:01:47.760
<v Speaker 1>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to know that real families,</v>

35
00:01:47.761 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>we're actually doing these real things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I'm willing to try.</v>

36
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>There is this idea about families that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>

37
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>no place else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our jobs,</v>

38
00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>we work on those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our hobbies,</v>

39
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>we work on those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have our bodies,</v>

40
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>our relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We work on those somehow.</v>

41
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:08.130
<v Speaker 1>There's this idea that that families are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just supposed to be,</v>

42
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be organic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kids come with their own</v>

43
00:02:10.711 --> 00:02:14.970
<v Speaker 1>instruction manual or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but every parent I know doesn't feel</v>

44
00:02:14.971 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We feel like our lives are out of</v>

45
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 1>control and if I could put it in one</v>
<v Speaker 1>headline,</v>

46
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>I would say that as a parent I felt like</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always playing defense and never</v>

47
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:28.890
<v Speaker 1>playing offense and yet there's all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these new ideas out there.</v>

48
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>So if that's where the action is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the action is in business or in</v>

49
00:02:33.691 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>sports or in some place else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's bring those ideas in.</v>

50
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.390
<v Speaker 1>If your family doesn't have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

51
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take these solutions.</v>

52
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of not wagging my finger and</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling people what to do.</v>

53
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that we were desperate for</v>
<v Speaker 1>new ideas.</v>

54
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>I went founding them and I found a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them in unlikely places.</v>

55
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>When I sat out working on the secrets of</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy families,</v>

56
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>I made a vow to myself that I wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>squeeze everything into a list of three</v>

57
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>or five or seven things that you must do</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a happy family.</v>

58
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm up at you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I hate those lists.</v>

59
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I forget number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with number four and I feel</v>

60
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>like I'm doomed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of things I tried to do was to put</v>

61
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>200 new ideas in this book because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be very obvious that nobody could</v>

62
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>do them all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you pick three or five or seven</v>

63
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>that works for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it might be different than what</v>

64
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>works for me or what works for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>sister.</v>

65
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I think you can have a happier family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to me the biggest takeaway is you</v>

66
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>don't need some master plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need some big new scheme</v>

67
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be hard to set up and</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to follow.</v>

68
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.960
<v Speaker 1>You need to take small steps and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulate small wins.</v>

69
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.300
<v Speaker 1>What's the secret to a happy family?</v>
