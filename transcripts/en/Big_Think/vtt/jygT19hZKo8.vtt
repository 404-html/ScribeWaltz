1
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hired somebody to help us with the</v>

2
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.820
<v Speaker 1>business that was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have,</v>

3
00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you say you should listen to your</v>

4
00:00:20.511 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were feeling like we were,</v>

5
00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say overwhelmed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we know we needed a consultant for</v>

6
00:00:27.681 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>something and we knew we needed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consultant but weren't really sure how</v>

7
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 1>to address it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And somebody had recommended somebody</v>

8
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>and we both felt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>there was something off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it turned out to be very,</v>

10
00:00:39.741 --> 00:00:43.080
<v Speaker 1>very off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll,</v>

11
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I'll look at it that it was a learning</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and it could have been a lot</v>

12
00:00:46.491 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

13
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:51.740
<v Speaker 1>we caught it at the beginning and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost done.</v>

14
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's the newest mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

15
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>and I think he might not hear it is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst mistake.</v>

16
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe because he was toxic.</v>

17
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the worst.</v>

18
00:00:59.751 --> 00:01:03.290
<v Speaker 1>It was just someone who lied and cheated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

19
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>and it happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.273
<v Speaker 1>it's human nature.</v>

21
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of mistakes,</v>

22
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but nothing like big or bad.</v>

23
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.921
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>

24
00:01:09.921 --> 00:01:14.921
<v Speaker 1>we usually catch them at a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the good news is when you're</v>

25
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 1>relatively small or yours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make mistakes,</v>

26
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>so relatively small as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're big it can be colossal.</v>

27
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 1>And so as a young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very supple company we can recover from,</v>

28
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.180
<v Speaker 1>but everyone makes mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real question is do you make</v>

29
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:35.181
<v Speaker 1>the same mistake twice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's is important.</v>

30
00:01:36.821 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.770
<v Speaker 1>probably should have done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do more due diligence.</v>

32
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

33
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>the business was moving very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fast and frantically,</v>

34
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 1>we know we needed somebody and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

35
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.870
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just do it.</v>

36
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.361
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

37
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 2>we've made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've made higher.</v>

38
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 2>We've had hires that have been sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>got responses which have been great and</v>

39
00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 2>others that have not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've had other hires that weren't</v>

40
00:02:00.651 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Speaker 2>necessarily a gut response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they were hired nonetheless and</v>

41
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrific ones where we weren't</v>

42
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>

43
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lesson after two,</v>

44
00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:12.550
<v Speaker 1>three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have.</v>

45
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>And we probably should've reacted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.820
<v Speaker 1>more quickly than we actually did</v>

47
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 2>for a company of our size.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing that I think is most crucial</v>

48
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 2>in terms of what we do is hurting</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody that culturally is a good fit.</v>

49
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.450
<v Speaker 2>And if they're smart and they fill the</v>
<v Speaker 2>position in a,</v>

50
00:02:31.451 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 2>in a manner for which they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience or we feel is appropriate,</v>

51
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:35.794
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

52
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Having the cultural fit and the passion</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the business is probably the biggest</v>

53
00:02:41.111 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 2>hurdle because we're only 20 people of</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

54
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 of those are working sort of right</v>

55
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:51.151
<v Speaker 2>out of our office in New York City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the most crucial</v>

56
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:54.130
<v Speaker 2>aspect of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of where we are for this size today.</v>
