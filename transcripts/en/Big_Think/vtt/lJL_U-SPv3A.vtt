1
00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So what is a habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the key thing about a habit</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.250
<v Speaker 1>really comes down to decision making</v>
<v Speaker 1>because sometimes people think about</v>

3
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>it's something that you do repeatedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know it unfolds over time,</v>

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>but really the key thing about a habit</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not making a decision.</v>

5
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>You're not deciding whether to brush</v>
<v Speaker 1>your teeth,</v>

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>you're not deciding whether to use the</v>
<v Speaker 1>seatbelt,</v>

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not deciding whether to go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>gym first thing in the morning,</v>

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>you've already decided,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the advantage of a habit is that</v>

9
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 1>once some things on automatic pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the brain doesn't have to use any</v>

10
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>energy or willpower to make a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've already made that decision.</v>

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>You're just moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it happens easily without any</v>

12
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any willpower,</v>

13
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>with any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any effort.</v>

14
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>You're just on cruise control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you can do what you want to get</v>

15
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:43.944
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

16
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>How that is like the invisible</v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture of everyday life.</v>

17
00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Research shows that something like 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of what we do every day,</v>

18
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>we do in pretty much the same way and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same context.</v>

19
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's easy to see that if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits that work for you,</v>

20
00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be happier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier,</v>

21
00:00:59.611 --> 00:01:02.220
<v Speaker 1>and more productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have habits that don't work for</v>

22
00:01:02.221 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really going to drag you down</v>

23
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>because it's a big part of our days is</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken up by habits.</v>

24
00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>What are the mysteries of habit system?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we persist in having bad habits</v>

25
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:15.810
<v Speaker 1>when we know they're not good for us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they know they don't make us happy,</v>

26
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.150
<v Speaker 1>but you know there's usually multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>things going.</v>

27
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's what you want right this</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute versus what you want on the</v>

28
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>longterm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you want to.</v>

29
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Things that are in conflict.</v>

30
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to have plenty of time to hang</v>

31
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 1>out and goof around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

32
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasant department.</v>

33
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.440
<v Speaker 1>So you have two things that are in</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>

34
00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>So when you have a bad habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very helpful to think very clearly,</v>

35
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>what do I really want over the longterm?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's what's really most important to</v>

36
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that can help you fight back against</v>

37
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>the pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gravitational pull that a bad habit</v>

38
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:47.350
<v Speaker 1>can exert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things people say about how</v>

39
00:01:47.351 --> 00:01:50.670
<v Speaker 1>this sometimes is they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make healthy choices and I completely</v>

40
00:01:50.671 --> 00:01:52.800
<v Speaker 1>disagree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't make healthy choices,</v>

41
00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>make one healthy choice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then no more deciding.</v>

42
00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 1>The reason that habits can give us so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more power in our lives is that</v>

43
00:02:00.631 --> 00:02:02.520
<v Speaker 1>they eliminate the need for decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making.</v>

44
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.110
<v Speaker 1>You can just decide one time what you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do and then you don't revisit</v>

45
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>that decision because every time we make</v>
<v Speaker 1>a decision we have the opportunity to</v>

46
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>decide wrong and even if we decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly,</v>

47
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.510
<v Speaker 1>we still are using a lot of energy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle with that decision.</v>

48
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>So you really want to use decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making to set out a habit that you want</v>

49
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>and maybe to anticipate a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

50
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:28.110
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the stumbling blocks that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>might encounter along the way as you're</v>

51
00:02:28.111 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 1>trying to form that habit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once you've made that decision,</v>

52
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 1>don't look back the side once and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more deciding.</v>

53
00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 1>One question is whether you're better</v>
<v Speaker 1>off trying to do one habit at a time.</v>

54
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to make change or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you do many all at once and like</v>

55
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>many things with habit formation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just no magic answer.</v>

56
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>There's no one size fits all solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people do better when they start</v>

57
00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they keep it very simple and they</v>

58
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>gain the habit of the habit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a feeling of accomplishment and</v>

59
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.760
<v Speaker 1>it's very manageable and realistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's something very small and</v>

60
00:02:56.761 --> 00:02:58.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just like one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

61
00:02:58.801 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>there are some who love to go big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big transformations and big challenges</v>

62
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.470
<v Speaker 1>and so something to do is to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and think,</v>

63
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have I succeeded in the past?</v>

64
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Or what appeals more to my nature?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think about what works for you</v>

65
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>because there really isn't one perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to change a habit or to change a</v>

66
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>bunch of habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really depends on what's going to</v>

67
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:17.920
<v Speaker 1>work for you.</v>
