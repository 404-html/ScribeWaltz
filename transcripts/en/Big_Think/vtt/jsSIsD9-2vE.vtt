1
00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.430
<v Speaker 1>have a variety of guises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So some of the Audi vaccines,</v>

3
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>well known as attenuated vaccines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's is the infectious organism had</v>

4
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>been changed such it could still</v>
<v Speaker 1>replicate and even body but not cause</v>

5
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is what happened with the first</v>

6
00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:32.560
<v Speaker 1>vaccine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't fight by Jenna using cow pox</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a means of preventing smallpox and a</v>

8
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 1>cow pox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>had sufficient similarity to smallpox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could elicit,</v>

10
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>induce an immune response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was protective against smallpox.</v>

11
00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>So that was a whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>live virus which was used to prevent</v>
<v Speaker 1>smallpox later on,</v>

13
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 1>people using what's known as killed</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccines.</v>

14
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So influencer is a good example where</v>
<v Speaker 1>influenza is grown up in eggs or tissue</v>

15
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's then killed and then administered</v>

16
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>as a killed virus to the individual via</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypodermic needle.</v>

17
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>And those proteins are seen as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign by the immune system.</v>

18
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 1>They are an infectious disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't belong to the body and</v>

19
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:31.121
<v Speaker 1>therefore an immune responses mounted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More recently people have been able to</v>

20
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>identify specific proteins from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious organism.</v>

21
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.610
<v Speaker 1>A Nice example is the hepatitis B</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccine where the surface protein,</v>

22
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>a isolated from the virus via genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering and just that single protein</v>

23
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.810
<v Speaker 1>is grown up purified and then used as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccine and just the immune response to</v>

24
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>that single protein is able to prevent</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual from becoming infected by</v>

25
00:01:58.941 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>the virus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's numbers of ways that one can</v>

26
00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:07.151
<v Speaker 1>generate a vaccine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of change over the</v>

27
00:02:08.411 --> 00:02:13.411
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of this has been enabled by the,</v>

28
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molecular biology revolution coming out</v>

29
00:02:16.151 --> 00:02:21.100
<v Speaker 1>of the seventies and eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allowed us to clone and express</v>

30
00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.710
<v Speaker 1>proteins from various infectious</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>

31
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly viruses,</v>

32
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.460
<v Speaker 1>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fungi.</v>

33
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>And being able to work with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>proteins has enabled us to get a better</v>

34
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:36.310
<v Speaker 1>understanding as to how those infectious</v>
<v Speaker 1>organisms,</v>

35
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infect individuals,</v>

36
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.020
<v Speaker 1>how they evade the immune system.</v>

37
00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>And specifically it's allowed us to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>Achilles heels for the various bugs,</v>

38
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.870
<v Speaker 1>whether it'd be for antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>targeting various proteins and bacteria</v>

39
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>to prevent them from replicating or</v>
<v Speaker 1>antiviral trucks where we can inhibit a</v>

40
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>viral to prevent the virus from</v>
<v Speaker 1>replicating in a human cell.</v>

41
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>The genetics have been very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to understand how to make better</v>

42
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>vaccines against some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>infectious organisms.</v>

43
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And really just studying these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.520
<v Speaker 1>bugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>at a very detailed level and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with the immune system helps</v>

46
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:24.931
<v Speaker 1>us understand how we could perhaps help</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immune system do a better job at</v>

47
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>preventing infection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So generating vaccines that don't</v>

48
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:31.080
<v Speaker 1>utilize the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>infectious organism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just using parts of it,</v>

50
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by generating what we would call a</v>

51
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>neutralizing immune response,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it be antibodies which bind</v>

52
00:03:41.441 --> 00:03:43.490
<v Speaker 1>specifically to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>proteins on the bug and effectively take</v>
<v Speaker 1>it out of circulation and prevent the</v>

54
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:54.421
<v Speaker 1>person from being infected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The science around infectious diseases</v>

55
00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>has been really quite key to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

56
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give us some really key insights</v>

57
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:02.680
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>the immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And based on our increased understanding</v>

59
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.780
<v Speaker 1>of the immune system over the last 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>odd years has enabled us to discern how</v>

60
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>we could perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

61
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>use the immune system to manage disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that people probably hadn't</v>

62
00:04:22.511 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>thought about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.420
<v Speaker 1>only a few years ago.</v>

64
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.980
<v Speaker 1>Being so interested in vaccines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing how much,</v>

65
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.890
<v Speaker 1>potential they hold for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to see Jenna who</v>

67
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.980
<v Speaker 1>effectively invented vaccination as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

68
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous,</v>

69
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

70
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.610
<v Speaker 1>stalwart and inventor in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he probably is my number one public</v>

71
00:04:51.181 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>health hero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then we have to go to people like</v>

72
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:57.540
<v Speaker 1>saul can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving who invented the polio vaccines,</v>

73
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 1>you can go on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's probably because the</v>

75
00:05:01.651 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>vaccines have had such a major impact in</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving public health throughout the</v>

76
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 1>that one has to look to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vaccinologist as,</v>

78
00:05:11.161 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being public health heroes.</v>

79
00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
