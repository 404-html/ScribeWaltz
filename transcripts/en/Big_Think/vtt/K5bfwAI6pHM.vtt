1
00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.830
<v Speaker 1>my recent visit to Congo to the eastern</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts that is the north and South Kivu</v>

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.410
<v Speaker 1>revealed that there is still a rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>unstable situation,</v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the east.</v>

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a followup to the atrocities in</v>

6
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the valley color territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm late August,</v>

7
00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>beginning of September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

8
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I withdraw the worried to visit some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these villages because I'm still.</v>

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>People are traumatized and I'm in a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

10
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>in a state of shock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

11
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>but they fear that their attackers might</v>
<v Speaker 1>come back or even that the deployment of</v>

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>a government troops in this area might</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that they also have to live off the</v>

14
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are deployed there without enough</v>

15
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.030
<v Speaker 1>to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without pay,</v>

16
00:01:03.031 --> 00:01:08.031
<v Speaker 1>without a barracks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it means that they are afraid that</v>

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>they will have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will start to loot and pillage</v>

18
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these villages as,</v>

19
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

20
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And then we can assume rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

21
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>this is actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an area where a close to the mining</v>

22
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>mining activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the BCA,</v>

23
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>a mining district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it means that,</v>

24
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the men from this small villages</v>

25
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:40.401
<v Speaker 1>probably work in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the mining business or to support the</v>

26
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>mining business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but very often these small minds or</v>

27
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 1>controlled by rebel groups or sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by government troops as,</v>

29
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

30
00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>it means that it's a very sort of unsafe</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation for,</v>

31
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.260
<v Speaker 1>for civilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

32
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.250
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately this is something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuels the,</v>

33
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>the ongoing conflict and some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rebels.</v>

34
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So it leaves the civil population very</v>
<v Speaker 1>exposed and under a kind of constant</v>

35
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:18.924
<v Speaker 1>stress.</v>

36
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody said the same thing.</v>

37
00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:29.550
<v Speaker 1>They want peace and they hope that piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>will bring peace also to the women.</v>

38
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not,</v>

39
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>we cannot be sure that it brings peace</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the women because when this is done</v>

40
00:02:37.171 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>at the scale that we saw in the editor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oratory and in these villages,</v>

41
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately it brutalizes the whole</v>

42
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:48.540
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been sober on the civil society.</v>

43
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.360
<v Speaker 1>And that means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new generation of young men and boys</v>

45
00:02:54.631 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>will also think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is a,</v>

46
00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:01.981
<v Speaker 1>a natural thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And women don't feel that they have that</v>

47
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>they are valued that they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one young woman said to us that she.</v>

48
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Her impression was that she was of</v>
<v Speaker 1>course very distraught,</v>

49
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>but she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a dead rat is worth more than the body</v>

50
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>of a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

51
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>and I think this just shows that at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment the women who are very much the</v>

52
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:25.621
<v Speaker 1>backbone of the economy of the DRC</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just sort of not valued.</v>

53
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are broken.</v>

54
00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.540
<v Speaker 1>And that means also it will be so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>more difficult to build peace and any</v>

55
00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>kind of economic development in the DRC.</v>
