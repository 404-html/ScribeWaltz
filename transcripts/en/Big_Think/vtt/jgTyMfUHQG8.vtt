00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.270
<v Speaker 1>You syllables answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be nine 11.</v>

2
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>I was working at the Wall Street Journal</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time.</v>

3
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>My main job was as an editor in the days</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weeks and months after nine 11,</v>

4
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>I spent all my time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>editing stories for the Journal's front</v>
<v Speaker 1>page about the fallout from nine 11,</v>

6
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 1>most of it international,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>at least initially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I edited many stories about Islam</v>

8
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>and about Muslims and about the turmoil</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has enveloped,</v>

9
00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that religion and its adherence.</v>

10
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of that had to do with Islam</v>

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>overseas and Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>outside the boundaries of the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

13
00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.780
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely just began to get curious</v>
<v Speaker 1>over time about Muslims in this country</v>

14
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>and the journal was chased from its</v>
<v Speaker 1>offices by nine 11.</v>

15
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>the attacks took place literally across</v>
<v Speaker 1>the street from the journal offices and</v>

17
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>for a year we were dispersed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>different places when the newspaper</v>

18
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>recollected itself and its old office.</v>

19
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.420
<v Speaker 1>As in my work life became a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>more normal again.</v>

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided to carve out some time to work</v>

21
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>on a series of articles about Muslims in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>And increasingly as I did those</v>
<v Speaker 1>articles,</v>

23
00:01:18.781 --> 00:01:22.260
<v Speaker 1>I realized that one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American Muslim experience was an</v>

24
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:27.261
<v Speaker 1>entirely distinct from Muslim immigrant</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences elsewhere and even more</v>

25
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>distinct from the experience of Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the predominantly Muslim world.</v>

26
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.710
<v Speaker 1>And as I got deeper and deeper into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and found the tremendous variety within</v>

27
00:01:37.711 --> 00:01:42.711
<v Speaker 1>American Islam and found the tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>flux that exists within that subject</v>

28
00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there is no one American Islam,</v>

29
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:51.210
<v Speaker 1>there is no one model of American Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that Muslims themselves in this</v>

30
00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:56.211
<v Speaker 1>country in a way that is mostly very</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy and very encouraging.</v>

31
00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>When you come to understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are engaged in a,</v>

32
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Speaker 1>in an extraordinary debate over what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means to be a Muslim in a wealthy</v>

33
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Western society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the united that of the</v>

34
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that began to have the feel of</v>

35
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 1>enough of a having enough heft to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthy,</v>

36
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>not just of newspaper articles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe have a book.</v>

37
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 1>And the struggle that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>that you mentioned that I used as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtitle for the book that struggle is</v>

39
00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>the internal struggle within Islam in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

40
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>Much of what I write about in the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do with conflicts among Muslims</v>

41
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:32.100
<v Speaker 1>in this country from many different</v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds,</v>

42
00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>with many different understandings of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own religion as they try to sort</v>

43
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>out what it means to be Muslim.</v>
