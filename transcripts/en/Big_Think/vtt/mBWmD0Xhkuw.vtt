1
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems as if there's a really big</v>

2
00:00:13.441 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>switch between about five and six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's funny because in our</v>

3
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>culture we say we talk about that age</v>
<v Speaker 1>group is preschoolers versus school aged</v>

4
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course school is a very recent</v>

5
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 1>invention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you look across lots of cultures,</v>

6
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.870
<v Speaker 1>something happens around you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around six.</v>

7
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 1>So the babies say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:37.371
<v Speaker 1>we'll move from the mother's quarters to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the children's quarters or they babies</v>

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:38.320
<v Speaker 1>used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>kids used to start becoming apprentice</v>
<v Speaker 1>being being apprentices when they were</v>

11
00:00:42.721 --> 00:00:44.050
<v Speaker 1>about seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>sort of losing your first tooth seems to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a big marker of this transition.</v>

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think what happens is that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of transition,</v>

14
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:52.740
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:52.741 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>starting at four or five and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing is really a transition from a</v>

16
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>creature that's mostly designed to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this very broad based learning to a</v>

17
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>creature that's starting to develop the</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific skills that are going to be</v>

18
00:01:04.471 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 1>important as an adult.</v>

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>So by the time you get to a seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>

20
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:09.690
<v Speaker 1>nine year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can actually work.</v>

21
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean they can actually do things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually do things that are</v>

22
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>productive and helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>and they're starting to get those</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow,</v>

24
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.960
<v Speaker 1>more narrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe I think to say it's not just more</v>
<v Speaker 1>narrow but more specialized.</v>

26
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>So in some cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our culture really values are very,</v>

27
00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>very narrow focus of attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we teach kids to do in</v>

28
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other cultures what they'll do is</v>

29
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>teach kids to do things like shift</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention from one thing to another very</v>

30
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

31
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.793
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

32
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.060
<v Speaker 1>the important thing is that in all</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures you go from this early very,</v>

33
00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>very wide ranging attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is like infants to,</v>

34
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 1>and here's the attentional strategy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is important to do.</v>

35
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>The things that you need to do in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this culture.</v>

36
00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it can be the narrow focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have in,</v>

37
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>in our culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other cultures,</v>

38
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>as I say it might be if you're a hunter</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

39
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:03.420
<v Speaker 1>it might be how to pay attention to lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different things at once in order to</v>

40
00:02:03.421 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>hunt more effectively.</v>

41
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Show me how they can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>what can we do to make them do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>better?</v>

43
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm afraid,</v>

44
00:02:13.821 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>I think the answer to it is pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>boring,</v>

45
00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have lots of caregivers around who loved</v>

46
00:02:19.911 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>them a lot and have lots of stuff around</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to play with and let them play</v>

47
00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>without worrying too much about whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting academic skills or</v>

48
00:02:27.081 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>they're making a mass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I say is from an</v>

49
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the ideal rich environment for</v>

50
00:02:32.961 --> 00:02:35.090
<v Speaker 1>a baby has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>includes more mud,</v>

51
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.760
<v Speaker 1>livestock and relatives than most of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>could tolerate,</v>

52
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays.</v>

53
00:02:38.961 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>some pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

55
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot of dirt and a bunch of uncles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cousins,</v>

56
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 1>that's probably pretty good environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for babies to grow up and,</v>

57
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>but if you can't manage that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a lot of cardboard boxes,</v>

58
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being plants,</v>

59
00:02:53.181 --> 00:02:54.750
<v Speaker 1>goldfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

60
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things you see in fact</v>
<v Speaker 1>sandboxes,</v>

61
00:02:57.321 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>the kind of things you see and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

62
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:00.750
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

63
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>when I say that it sounds very boring</v>
<v Speaker 1>and banal,</v>

64
00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 1>but here's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one important thing.</v>

65
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 1>We know from the science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the thing that kids learn from most</v>

66
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>is other people and particularly other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are dedicated to taking care</v>

67
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in most places and times in human</v>

68
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>babies have had not just one person,</v>

69
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:22.990
<v Speaker 1>but lots of people around who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>really paying attention to them around</v>

70
00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>care to them.</v>

71
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>We're related to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

72
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the big shift in our culture</v>

73
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>is the isolation in which many children</v>
<v Speaker 1>are growing up.</v>

74
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>So in fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we really wanted to make babies</v>

75
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we would do is make sure that 20%</v>

76
00:03:39.071 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>of them aren't growing up in poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that even middle class parents</v>

77
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>aren't so insane because they're working</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard that they can't spend time with</v>

78
00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 1>their kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure that preschool workers are</v>

79
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>actually paid more than dog catchers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the thing that's most important is</v>

80
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:57.481
<v Speaker 1>having people who are involved and</v>
<v Speaker 1>engaged with the kids and also are not</v>

81
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>stressed and can be involved with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually not boring and</v>

82
00:04:01.961 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Banal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually takes a lot of work to</v>

83
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's not something that our society</v>

84
00:04:06.251 --> 00:04:07.084
<v Speaker 1>does very well</v>

85
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.920
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
