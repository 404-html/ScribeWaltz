1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started this whole project by looking</v>

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:02.930
<v Speaker 1>at Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Keep it in the data and writing the blog</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I did and hopefully will one day do</v>

4
00:00:07.351 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>it again very soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's the best data center in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world cause it's people,</v>

6
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>all strangers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll making judgments of one another all</v>

7
00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>probably trying to sleep with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

8
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:20.430
<v Speaker 1>which is also adds a certain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>pick one see to the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.591
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

11
00:00:23.591 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 1>you look at the data and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you really get a kind of special window</v>
<v Speaker 1>into people's psyche.</v>

13
00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of like,</v>

14
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>you could see everything that was going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on in a big bunker on a Friday night.</v>

15
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that,</v>

16
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>that men are the kind of pursuers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships that have four to one</v>

17
00:00:38.881 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of correspondingly,</v>

18
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>women because they're getting four</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages to everyone they send out,</v>

20
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>like they respond a lot less.</v>

21
00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

22
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.080
<v Speaker 1>and response rates to track directly</v>
<v Speaker 1>with how hot the writer was is a,</v>

23
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>but then you also see that once people</v>
<v Speaker 1>start talking,</v>

24
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they established a rapport,</v>

25
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.540
<v Speaker 1>which for Okcupid is for converse at</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

26
00:00:58.541 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>four messages going back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that attracting,</v>

27
00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:02.400
<v Speaker 1>this kind of goes out the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>

28
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>your personality takes over after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth message.</v>

29
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see that,</v>

30
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general women's opinions of men's</v>

31
00:01:11.101 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

32
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.350
<v Speaker 1>and I get an on average is about half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what men's opinions of women's looks</v>

33
00:01:16.351 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they kind of get a 50% discount just</v>

34
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>ice cold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

35
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>on tinder it's actually a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something like a 10,</v>

36
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.350
<v Speaker 1>a 10% discount or 90% discount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

37
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the other way they go at 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>so these environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is,</v>

39
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I can't prove this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My intuition is that the more sexual and</v>

40
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger that discount,</v>

41
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

42
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>from men to women or from women to men.</v>

43
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba's userbase in theory on paper is as</v>

44
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:42.510
<v Speaker 1>liberal as you could ever want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

45
00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>you ask people if they're a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they're progressive,</v>

46
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.261
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

47
00:01:46.261 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.071
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

49
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:47.610
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

50
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're all highly coastal,</v>

51
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>very little red state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very blue and a piece of paper.</v>

52
00:01:53.101 --> 00:01:53.331
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep,</v>

53
00:01:53.331 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>it should be a very progressive place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it is because who knows what</v>

54
00:01:57.121 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the data that we have,</v>

55
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:04.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>black users get three quarters of the</v>

56
00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.183
<v Speaker 1>messages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

57
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive votes,</v>

58
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

59
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.671
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

60
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 1>their attractions ratings or three</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters of an average white user,</v>

61
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.103
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

62
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.690
<v Speaker 1>or Latino user for that matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>they reply to about three quarters of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time it's pretty blanket.</v>

64
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian men also get a similar discount</v>

65
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but not Asian women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you go and you look at at date</v>

66
00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>hookup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a site we run,</v>

67
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look@thedataformaster.com you'll see</v>

68
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>the exact same patterns.</v>

69
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not in the exact same ratios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the same basic up,</v>

70
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.420
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

71
00:02:33.421 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>No pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you compare any race with another</v>

72
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of suggested,</v>

73
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.350
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a once a universal in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of permanent pattern,</v>

74
00:02:40.351 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly like I state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs right now in the American</v>

75
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:44.911
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

76
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:46.410
<v Speaker 1>and these three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those three sites alone,</v>

77
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

78
00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:51.510
<v Speaker 1>that they registered maybe 30 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the United States last year.</v>

79
00:02:51.511 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like some small sample.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's about half of the single</v>

80
00:02:55.471 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and looking people in the country to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>best guess to the,</v>

81
00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the census numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

82
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:01.651
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

83
00:03:01.651 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty meaningful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and pretty depressing thing to kind of</v>

85
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.233
<v Speaker 1>digest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>insofar as like Grindr or any of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>other sites,</v>

87
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.680
<v Speaker 1>they're kind of hookup apps are hookup</v>
<v Speaker 1>apps for gay men.</v>

88
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>Okcupid is a little bit more of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship side and we have a very</v>

89
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

90
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.390
<v Speaker 1>gay userbase men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>male and female,</v>

91
00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we get to look at their patterns and</v>

92
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically the same as straight</v>

93
00:03:22.481 --> 00:03:23.111
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

94
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:28.111
<v Speaker 1>which I think is</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful in the context of marriage</v>

95
00:03:28.211 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>equality because it certainly the pre</v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage relationships seem about the</v>

96
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>same when you actually go and look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data,</v>

97
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.120
<v Speaker 1>which I think is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>a strong argument for any type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship being held apart legally</v>

99
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

100
00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most significant thing that</v>

101
00:03:41.651 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>people do on OK cupid because it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>precursor to going out,</v>

102
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>going home with somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into a relationship with</v>

103
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>somebody getting married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any of that stuff is just messaging.</v>

104
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:52.390
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we found some kind of crazy stuff</v>

105
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:53.224
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter how long your</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages,</v>

107
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.771
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

108
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>the best messages are very short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 to 50 characters.</v>

109
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 1>But by best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:04.690
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get a reply 2120 2% of the time and</v>

111
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>kind of all messages get a reply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 19,</v>

112
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>20% of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like a massive increase.</v>

113
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does help you to spend a little bit</v>

114
00:04:11.561 --> 00:04:15.730
<v Speaker 1>more time on your message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put a little script to just track the</v>

115
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:18.490
<v Speaker 1>time since the composition window</v>
<v Speaker 1>opened.</v>

116
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>And so if you put a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort into your master's per character,</v>

117
00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will yield slightly better results.</v>

118
00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

119
00:04:26.831 --> 00:04:27.664
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

120
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>it's not a huge effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were,</v>

121
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>we were surprised at both of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

122
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 1>I thought that longer messages we either</v>
<v Speaker 1>do super badly or do super well and that</v>

123
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.870
<v Speaker 1>if you spend a lot of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least on your message,</v>

124
00:04:37.871 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>it would do better than something you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like and type it and go,</v>

125
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

126
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>as a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little sad to say,</v>

127
00:04:43.541 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>but it kinda comes down to just think it</v>
<v Speaker 1>does in person.</v>

128
00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>There's so much like first impression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which online is your picture,</v>

129
00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:50.643
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that your actual words aren't as</v>

131
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 1>relevant as you probably wish they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to that point,</v>

132
00:04:58.211 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people being the kind of like intuitive</v>

133
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 1>to people and math being the intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius is that they are the wisdom of</v>

134
00:05:03.461 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the crowds or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

135
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>you have like 20% of messages from guys</v>
<v Speaker 1>to women are copy and pasted from other</v>

136
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>messages that the guys have sent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

137
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>they found something that for whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason either works or typifies them or</v>

138
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.580
<v Speaker 1>that they like or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they just tricking,</v>

139
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>just blast it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

140
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those actually they do worse.</v>

141
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do but not that much worse.</v>

142
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>They do like 70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>75% of of a normal message,</v>

143
00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>theoretically unique message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

144
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.540
<v Speaker 1>and so you get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy to arrive at,</v>

145
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.563
<v Speaker 1>at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

146
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>results per unit effort is like sky</v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

147
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.290
<v Speaker 1>just cut and pasting.</v>

148
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we at that probably will be</v>

149
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:42.660
<v Speaker 1>something that increases over time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

150
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought about trying to kind of,</v>

151
00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy for us to know whether a</v>
<v Speaker 1>message has been cut and pasted from</v>

152
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>another message.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously right now you just compare it.</v>

153
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just decided to let those things</v>

154
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>go because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

156
00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>it's just the online equivalent of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people having their favorite anecdote</v>

157
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>about themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or this one time they got into this</v>

158
00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>crazy bar fight or I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some dumb story how I got the scar,</v>

159
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing in a bar or just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a standard pickup line that you might</v>

160
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's one of these things that the</v>

161
00:06:08.031 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>online version of it seems very weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of unsavory to be like,</v>

162
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this do just sent the same message to</v>

163
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>like 40 people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've probably told the same story.</v>

164
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Everybody that I'm friends with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably heard a large set of the</v>

165
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:19.890
<v Speaker 1>same stories from me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that people just do.</v>

167
00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
