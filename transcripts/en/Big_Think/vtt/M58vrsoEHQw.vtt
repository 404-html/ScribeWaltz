<v Speaker 1>In these times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology</v>

2
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>generally decreasing communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean real communication.</v>

4
00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell phones,</v>

5
00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a superficiality involved.</v>

6
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>And also again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a separation from the content and from</v>

7
00:00:31.671 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>the person delivering the content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>people ask,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a cell phone myself.</v>

9
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>People ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.000
<v Speaker 1>don't you feel that it makes</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication easier and better?</v>

11
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

12
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

13
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>I think that most often a cell phone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>used for superfluous conversation.</v>

14
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.800
<v Speaker 1>Where are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the most asked question on a cell</v>

15
00:00:57.801 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who cares?</v>

16
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Does that make my life better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I know that you're standing on the</v>

17
00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>corner of Fifth Avenue and 18th Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that communication?</v>

18
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.190
<v Speaker 1>Are we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we really communicating?</v>

19
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Are we connecting or is there something</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between us?</v>

20
00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And is that technology that's standing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in between us rather than</v>

21
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
