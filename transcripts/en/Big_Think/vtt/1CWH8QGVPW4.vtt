1
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>We'll we talk about packaging for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second look.</v>

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.273
<v Speaker 1>That dot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the heart of any university is its </v>

3
00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with all of the developments,</v>

4
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:19.704
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

5
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.630
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.473
<v Speaker 1>if you ask me what the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements of mine now seven years as </v>

7
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>president of Nyu are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.333
<v Speaker 1>I would say to you that the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements of which I'm proudest are </v>

9
00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.060
<v Speaker 1>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of the faculty.</v>

10
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>And number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of student life.</v>

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.653
<v Speaker 1>And we have had enormous transformation </v>
<v Speaker 1>even at Washington square on both of </v>

12
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:51.651
<v Speaker 1>those dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heart of any university is faculty.</v>

13
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.853
<v Speaker 1>And then the key is to bring in really </v>
<v Speaker 1>dazzlingly talented students and make </v>

14
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:00.974
<v Speaker 1>sure they in the faculty interact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the formula you do that </v>

15
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>everything else spotless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what ends up happening in,</v>

16
00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in today's world,</v>

17
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:11.844
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is if you have the best faculty and the </v>

18
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:16.530
<v Speaker 1>most savvy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smartest students,</v>

19
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.843
<v Speaker 1>they tend to yearn for the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>global network university that I just </v>

20
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>described.</v>

21
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.613
<v Speaker 1>It emerges out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The university president does not </v>

22
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>operate in a command and control </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

23
00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>at least this one doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'm good at,</v>

24
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
<v Speaker 1>sometimes he's noticing what people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing or inclined to do before they </v>

25
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.740
<v Speaker 1>realize it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

26
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm a good storyteller,</v>

27
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.090
<v Speaker 1>so I tell a story of it that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize and to which they then behave.</v>

28
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:46.443
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

29
00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>so everything that I'm describing about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nyu as,</v>

30
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.123
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this global network university is </v>

31
00:01:52.741 --> 00:01:53.574
<v Speaker 1>something that I've seen emerging from </v>
<v Speaker 1>my colleagues and from the appetites of </v>

32
00:01:59.311 --> 00:02:00.144
<v Speaker 1>our students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can hardly keep up with the student </v>

33
00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 1>demand to study abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

34
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>how do you envision a faculty in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Global Network University?</v>

35
00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:12.061
<v Speaker 1>I've described?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

36
00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

37
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

38
00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.973
<v Speaker 1>I think that we're beginning to see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of a group that I called the </v>

40
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:25.860
<v Speaker 1>cosmopolitans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a cosmopolitan?</v>

41
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cosmopolitan is a person who sees a </v>

42
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.353
<v Speaker 1>life in an institution that allows him </v>
<v Speaker 1>or her and his or her family to move </v>

43
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing life through the Lens.</v>

44
00:02:45.981 --> 00:02:46.814
<v Speaker 1>Not simply a single culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many cultures that it's the kind of </v>

45
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:54.680
<v Speaker 1>person that enjoys traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a kind of person that enjoys,</v>

46
00:02:54.681 --> 00:02:55.514
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to ideas that a he or she has </v>

47
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>never heard before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he or she finds them inscrutable</v>

48
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>or repugnant or wonderfully attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>on first hearing.</v>

49
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do it.</v>

50
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.950
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

52
00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.041
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

53
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:12.874
<v Speaker 1>the curious now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a person who comes to Nyu or ready is a </v>

54
00:03:17.801 --> 00:03:22.801
<v Speaker 1>person who's eager to live in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment like New York.</v>

55
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>And the hypothesis is in New York is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>miniaturization of the world.</v>

56
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

57
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>we already present complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cacophony,</v>

58
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>wonderful human cacophony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

59
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.770
<v Speaker 1>not cacophony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's grading,</v>

60
00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>but cacophony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just my God aren't human beings,</v>

61
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.653
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

62
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.960
<v Speaker 1>That kind of cacophony and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

63
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

64
00:03:47.651 --> 00:03:47.891
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

65
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>that's the world that is coming because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

66
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:52.504
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the complexity and cacophony of </v>

67
00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>humankind is only going to become more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more apparent.</v>

68
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we make it symphonic?</v>

69
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's a certain group of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cosmopolitans that,</v>

70
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>that delight in that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have,</v>

71
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an almost insatiable appetite for it.</v>

72
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.170
<v Speaker 1>So the bet is that among the very best </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

73
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call them if you want the no bell or the</v>

74
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:20.914
<v Speaker 1>Tony Level people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that among that there's going </v>

75
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:25.050
<v Speaker 1>to be uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.953
<v Speaker 1>a substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what does substantial meaning in </v>

77
00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

78
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:32.380
<v Speaker 1>substantial can mean 3%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4%,</v>

79
00:04:32.381 --> 00:04:36.730
<v Speaker 1>5% one in 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be 12 and 20.</v>

80
00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're gonna only hire so many </v>

81
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>professors even at the largest private </v>
<v Speaker 1>university in the world.</v>

82
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are the only institution,</v>

83
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.013
<v Speaker 1>or at least if you're the first mover to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become this global network university </v>

84
00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.273
<v Speaker 1>such that a cosmopolitan can become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professor at the institution and know </v>

85
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>that he or she can have the benefit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving through the system.</v>

86
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a certain amount of collegiality,</v>

87
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you have to check it out with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>department chair,</v>

88
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>your dean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

89
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.280
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

90
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>the assumption is there that you'll be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to move through the system,</v>

91
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be able to give your </v>
<v Speaker 1>children the benefit of growing up,</v>

92
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>not as American Mano Linguists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a growing up on,</v>

93
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to,</v>

94
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>by the time they head off to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could have lived on three different</v>

95
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:27.010
<v Speaker 1>continents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:05:27.011 --> 00:05:29.000
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as part of a,</v>

97
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 1>a kind of fabric of a professional life </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Nyu.</v>

98
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:34.473
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that we will attract </v>
<v Speaker 1>these cosmopolitans to Nyu in a </v>

99
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.714
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate way and that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to be among the most highly </v>

100
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>talented professors.</v>

101
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.083
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of seeing the global network </v>

102
00:05:48.221 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 1>university as presenting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

103
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a challenge to faculty recruitment,</v>

104
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>I see it as presenting an with regard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty recruitment.</v>

105
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And of course the same thing will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>true of students.</v>

106
00:06:01.191 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>We want to make sure we explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves to students.</v>

107
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:04.693
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want some student coming in </v>

108
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>who's expecting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

109
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Notre Dame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm a 50s Catholic.</v>

111
00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>I root for Notre Dame every Saturday in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fall.</v>

112
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:16.391
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

113
00:06:16.391 --> 00:06:17.224
<v Speaker 1>I'm programmed that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is a reason Nyu does </v>

114
00:06:20.571 --> 00:06:21.404
<v Speaker 1>not do division one athletics that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply connected to its view of itself </v>

115
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 1>as the Global Network University and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complex society.</v>

116
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.930
<v Speaker 1>And that is that if you gather people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a football stadium or a basketball arena</v>

117
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:39.290
<v Speaker 1>all wearing the same colors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chanting the hymns that the cheerleaders</v>

118
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 1>tell you to chant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels very ozzie and Harriet to us.</v>

119
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It feels very 1950s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not the 21st century,</v>

120
00:06:47.661 --> 00:06:48.494
<v Speaker 1>a century of complex community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't want to give our students </v>

121
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.650
<v Speaker 1>easy community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to value community,</v>

122
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.173
<v Speaker 1>tell them it's complex and then teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>them the skills of bridging and </v>

123
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 1>tunneling out of their own micro </v>
<v Speaker 1>community to those other communities.</v>

124
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>So instead of doing division one </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletics,</v>

125
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 1>we give them exploration flaws in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dorms.</v>

126
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.100
<v Speaker 1>What's an explanation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fluids.</v>

127
00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.483
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would never do an explanation floor </v>

128
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 1>based upon the traditional dividing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

129
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So we wouldn't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

131
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>racially defined fluor or a religiously </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined flow.</v>

132
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>But you want to live with students who </v>
<v Speaker 1>love jazz.</v>

133
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 1>You want to live with students who love </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stock market.</v>

134
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.030
<v Speaker 1>You want to live with students who love </v>
<v Speaker 1>Broadway theater.</v>

135
00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>We have 80 exploration floors defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

136
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.020
<v Speaker 1>all students from different schools at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the university.</v>

137
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.153
<v Speaker 1>So there also a sudden now the bridges </v>
<v Speaker 1>and tunnels united by this interest </v>

138
00:07:50.691 --> 00:07:52.750
<v Speaker 1>faculty member embedded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:53.733
<v Speaker 1>er,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resident assistants embedded to build </v>

140
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 1>programming each week around whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>the unifying principle is,</v>

141
00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.720
<v Speaker 1>influence silo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

142
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 1>Out of the silo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

143
00:08:01.521 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shame on you.</v>

144
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Complex community interrelating </v>
<v Speaker 1>likewise,</v>

145
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.403
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're going to give you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this becomes an attracted to a </v>

146
00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>certain kind of student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not right for every student,</v>

147
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>but a certain kinds of students.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to explain yourself the fact</v>

148
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.060
<v Speaker 1>that you have to explain yourself to </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

149
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:21.140
<v Speaker 1>You have to tell them come complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Community.</v>

150
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hard community.</v>

151
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're about.</v>
