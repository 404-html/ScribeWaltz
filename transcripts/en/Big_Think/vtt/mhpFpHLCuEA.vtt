1
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Everything worth doing in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learn to ride a bike,</v>

2
00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>learning to walk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I was a kid,</v>

3
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:14.850
<v Speaker 1>learning to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I fell and cracked my skull,</v>

4
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>but I needed to learn to walk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking a test,</v>

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>getting married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting a driver's license.</v>

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>All of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they give you an improved capability or</v>

7
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>an improved richness in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all come with a degree of risk</v>

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>that is exaggerated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the thing that you want to do is fly</v>

9
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>a rocket ship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rocket ships are dangerous there.</v>

10
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.670
<v Speaker 1>It's a controlled explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drew a cartoon of a rocket,</v>

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>what it would be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be a bomb with six seats on the</v>

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:42.264
<v Speaker 1>top?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>rocket ships are crazy dangerous on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first flight of the space shuttle.</v>

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 1>When Bob Crippen and John Young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sitting there back in 1981 and</v>

15
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>they blast it off out of Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that we go back and we look at what</v>

16
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the actual history of the space shuttle</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

17
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>their odds of dying that day in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first eight and a half minutes were one</v>

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.124
<v Speaker 1>in nine.</v>

19
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Terrible odds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One in nine.</v>

20
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look around you and had 10 people and</v>

21
00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>realize that just to try that one and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine times they would have died.</v>

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>They got away with it and we learned a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot from it,</v>

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but even when I flew on my first shuttle</v>
<v Speaker 1>flight on the 74th shuttle flight,</v>

24
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.760
<v Speaker 1>we'd learned enough things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd improved it,</v>

25
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 1>but the odds of dying that day for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>crew were still one in 38,</v>

26
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Speaker 1>which is no insurance company would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>happy with.</v>

27
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to get life insurance as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>astronaut actually.</v>

28
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.310
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question you really need to ask</v>

29
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do I want to learn to walk?</v>

30
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to ride this bike?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to get married?</v>

31
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to learn to drive a car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What risks are worth taking in my life?</v>

32
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Because even if you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

33
00:01:48.631 --> 00:01:50.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take no risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stay at home and hide under</v>

34
00:01:50.821 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>my pillow.</v>

35
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>There's still risk with that and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>still gonna die eventually anyway.</v>

36
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.540
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a measure of what was</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth doing in your life and therefore</v>

37
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.500
<v Speaker 1>what was worth taking a risk for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you've got that behind you and</v>

38
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.334
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

39
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be an astronaut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fly a rocket ship.</v>

40
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.470
<v Speaker 1>That's a risk I'm going to take now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes your whole job.</v>

41
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.700
<v Speaker 1>Your job is not to be afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your job is not to be,</v>

42
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an incompetent nervous passenger.</v>

43
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>Your job now is to defeat the risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you learn to ride a bike,</v>

44
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>if you just stay as a passenger in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike,</v>

45
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you're never gonna know what to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the handlebars and you're never going to</v>

46
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>master riding a bike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once you can ride a bike,</v>

47
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.280
<v Speaker 1>you know you've got a freedom you never</v>
<v Speaker 1>had before and rocket ships or just the</v>

48
00:02:38.281 --> 00:02:39.114
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

49
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to decide what risks are worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking and then start changing who you</v>

50
00:02:43.711 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>learning how to turn the handlebars so</v>

51
00:02:45.931 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>that you could make this thing do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that otherwise might hurt you</v>

52
00:02:50.011 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>or kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then once you've got that done,</v>

53
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>it can take you to places and give you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>richness in your life that you never</v>

54
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:00.060
<v Speaker 1>would have had access any other way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

55
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 1>and in my case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you make it through that launch,</v>

56
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>when you've guided that rocket up</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the atmosphere and the engine</v>

57
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>shut off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly you're in the rarest of human</v>

58
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're weightless and the world is</v>

59
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 1>pouring by at five miles a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can see across an entire</v>

60
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>continent and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your,</v>

61
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>your piering into something that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new for humanity.</v>

62
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worth asking yourself what</v>
<v Speaker 1>risks are worth taking.</v>

64
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.080
<v Speaker 1>And once you've decided to take them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then change who you are so that you can,</v>

65
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>when you can defeat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can master that thing and open a</v>

66
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>door for yourself that otherwise was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just shut.</v>
