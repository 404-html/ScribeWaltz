00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.600
<v Speaker 1>school and I was nuts about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

122
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.810
<v Speaker 1>I realized they have to want it to after</v>
<v Speaker 1>a weekend of attracted,</v>

123
00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.160

<v Speaker 1>the high school music and art.</v>

124
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>But I stuck it out because I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went into buy the lever and um,</v>

125
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>I went to the first year and then the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second year I,</v>

127
00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:43.064
<v Speaker 1>I didn't cry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't quite know what to do when I </v>

128
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:47.540
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I know the school was so awful.</v>

129
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.790
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I want to buy first clashes.</v>

130
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.970
<v Speaker 1>At the second year they had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

131
00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I ran into another great mentor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a male teacher,</v>

132
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.990
<v Speaker 1>but marsha levitt and he looked at me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was,</v>

133
00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 1>he showed what I did for him and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

174
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.750
<v Speaker 1>somehow something drove me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do it and uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I went and I went and I had that I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the job I went to was pretty awful.</v>

177
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.450
<v Speaker 1>And I ended a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of stories,</v>

178
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.343
<v Speaker 1>a seemingly are apocryphal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually true when I kind of acted </v>

179
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.400
<v Speaker 1>up in my first agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can overturned the desk at shadows,</v>

180
00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>did some kind of crazy stuff that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

181
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.600
<v Speaker 1>after that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.443
<v Speaker 1>I went and I worked with somebody great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other greAt pioneers in advertising </v>

183
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>in and in an inadvertent designer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her blue bow and I worked there.</v>

184
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Then I went to the door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then brought back and work with them for</v>

185
00:09:33.751 --> 00:09:37.340
<v Speaker 1>bill burn back into and bob gauge and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

186
00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 1>and so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

187
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:41.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess something insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.223
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left doyle dane to a bar back and I </v>

189
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.094
<v Speaker 1>told him I was leaving to start the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second creative agency and work with </v>

190
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.920
<v Speaker 1>bill back and started the only creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>agency where the reason I started it,</v>

191
00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.173
<v Speaker 1>it was based on the fact that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked with paul rand early in his </v>

192
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:01.120
<v Speaker 1>career and somehow he understood that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for your work,</v>

193
00:10:01.121 --> 00:10:01.954
<v Speaker 1>but good to have a graphic designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a one who is prolific and </v>

194
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:06.793
<v Speaker 1>could write like poetry in that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do better advertising if you </v>

195
00:10:10.941 --> 00:10:11.920
<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

196
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are automatic,</v>

197
00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.343
<v Speaker 1>the could work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could conceive advertising with the </v>

198
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:18.294
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which up to that time basically all </v>

199
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 1>advertising was a attractor.</v>

200
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.063
<v Speaker 1>Sat in a room with his stomach was and </v>
<v Speaker 1>waited for the creative director for </v>

201
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the copywriter come in.</v>

202
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:31.163
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a piece of paper and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a layout yet later shout and the </v>

203
00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>layout,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.010
<v Speaker 1>the typical awful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.570
<v Speaker 1>unambitious layout.</v>

286
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.340
<v Speaker 1>when you go into advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's when everybody tells you to be</v>

287
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:16.174
<v Speaker 1>careful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>madman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that thumb show before that they </v>

306
00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:11.210

<v Speaker 1>client is.</v>

500
00:23:59.601 --> 00:24:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And then when you see it,</v>

509
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.570
<v Speaker 1>that when you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be,</v>

510
00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.140
<v Speaker 1>it should be a knock out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

517
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.290
<v Speaker 1>but you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

518
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:48.740
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every cover is when it hit,</v>

519
00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>when it was on a newsstand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peep some people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

552
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:15.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carolyn Hayes came to me.</v>

553
00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:16.933
<v Speaker 1>He had just basically taken over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship of their magazine even though he </v>

554
00:26:19.971 --> 00:26:22.970
<v Speaker 1>had been responsible for the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>or six or seven issues.</v>

555
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:24.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

<v Speaker 1>he had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had been leading in 1960 in 1962 </v>

559
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.170
<v Speaker 1>my ad agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

560
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.790
<v Speaker 1>and the reason he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it struck them was because it was an art</v>

561
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.700
<v Speaker 1>director with the first ad agency </v>
<v Speaker 1>publication lowish,</v>

<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

563
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.140
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a masthead.</v>

564
00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:45.280
<v Speaker 1>And the stories were all my advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.730
<v Speaker 1>every month there was a big story in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York times,</v>

566
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:48.564
<v Speaker 1>at least about campaigns I had done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was looking at the avid art </v>

567
00:26:52.891 --> 00:26:57.420
<v Speaker 1>directors are exciting work and </v>
<v Speaker 1>something made him call me,</v>

568
00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get advice on how to do coverage.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'd never done a cover in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

570
00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.200

572
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.903
<v Speaker 1>I thought he was trying to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising for our ad agency and I was </v>

573
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.303
<v Speaker 1>being nice to talk to them because I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been reading a magazine and it was a </v>

<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

683
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I found out many years later he ran </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he said he would quit if he,</v>

684
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:45.541
<v Speaker 1>if a publisher turned it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in fact when the issue came out,</v>

685
00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:51.070
<v Speaker 1>the publisher on king rich wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>editorial saying,</v>

686

<v Speaker 1>you cover,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

689
00:31:57.881 --> 00:31:59.360
<v Speaker 1>when the cover came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

690
00:31:59.380 --> 00:32:00.650
<v Speaker 1>when the issue came out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

691

<v Speaker 1>it was a laughing stock in the sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they hold the young five or </v>

693
00:32:09.101 --> 00:32:12.370
<v Speaker 1>six days later listening,</v>

<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

695
00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.590

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

696
00:32:18.591 --> 00:32:21.040
<v Speaker 1>the that I've met only a couple of years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
