1
00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>But we are engaging now in several</v>
<v Speaker 1>research projects.</v>

2
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>We started out with a study in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's disease,</v>

3
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>so we're working with a bay area</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parkinson's,</v>

4
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.990
<v Speaker 1>a treatment center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they also have researchers there.</v>

5
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way that works is that if you're</v>

6
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.060
<v Speaker 1>a part of 23 and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can fill out the online surveys that</v>

7
00:00:30.061 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>we have and you can fill out any ones</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're interested in.</v>

8
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>And they're not just all really serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

9
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>There are some fun surveys to fill out</v>
<v Speaker 1>about are you left or right handed idea,</v>

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>blue eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brown eyes.</v>

11
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of these features that we hope</v>

12
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>to also discover the genetics for which</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to be learned.</v>

13
00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're in the process of running more</v>

14
00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:50.970
<v Speaker 1>and more of those research experiments.</v>
