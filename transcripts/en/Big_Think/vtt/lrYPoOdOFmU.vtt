1
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>My mother raised us on real food and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a fan of Adele Davis who was the</v>

2
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.350
<v Speaker 1>pioneering slightly out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream nutritionist,</v>

3
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>but a lay woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

4
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>And so then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then a lot of people attacked her for</v>

5
00:00:23.241 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>not knowing enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.630
<v Speaker 1>who came out of California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>in the sixties and seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had a pretty big following and Adele</v>

8
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Davis had very simple principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of which have been pretty much born</v>

9
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:35.300
<v Speaker 1>out by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the subsequent science,</v>

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 1>wholefood b vitamins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real meat,</v>

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 1>real milk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>traditional fats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She has a few clunkers that don't</v>

13
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>survive the test of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you come across in her books.</v>

14
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>But on the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

15
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.720
<v Speaker 1>everything she said prove to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so my mother raised us on whole</v>

16
00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>wheat bread and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 1>the proverbial black strap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>molasses.</v>

18
00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 1>We made granola once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The children had,</v>

19
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an assignment to make granola.</v>

20
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also ate all the meats.</v>

21
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:07.130
<v Speaker 1>It was not a Vegan hit becoming our</v>
<v Speaker 1>little farm.</v>

22
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had very traditional simple</v>

23
00:01:10.371 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>American meals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fried chicken,</v>

24
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 1>meatloaf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food I regard as one of our super frugal</v>

27
00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>meals was macaroni with tuna and cream</v>
<v Speaker 1>sauce,</v>

28
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>which I loved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>my mother used to dip her toast in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bacon fat and nothing was off limits,</v>

30
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except white sugar and white flour.</v>

31
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Those would have been my mother's</v>
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>

32
00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>And she used to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how little money we have will</v>

33
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>always have real maple syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real olive oil and real butter.</v>

34
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.550
<v Speaker 1>We also had a cow and chickens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in addition to the vegetables,</v>

35
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 1>we were growing our vegetable farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we drank raw milk.</v>

36
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>We didn't make any cheese or dairy</v>
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

37
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been more homesteady</v>

38
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>than we were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we were really busy as commercial</v>

39
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>vegetable farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we did have fresh eggs and fresh</v>

40
00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 1>milk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what we couldn't raise</v>

41
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we bought or bartered for the farmer's</v>

42
00:02:02.451 --> 00:02:04.160
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in the dead of winter,</v>

43
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 1>we shopped at the supermarkets.</v>

44
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.630
<v Speaker 1>My concept of real food was grounded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mother's lessons for us.</v>

45
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>which were that it should be whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be traditional.</v>

47
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>It should be simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be processed,</v>

48
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 1>a small number of ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.100
<v Speaker 1>and then I sort of went off track and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:31.460
<v Speaker 1>in my teens and 20s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a Vegan and a vegetarian and</v>

51
00:02:31.461 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>tried to low fat diets and low saturated</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat diets and low cholesterol diets.</v>

52
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

54
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I did that is it was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much their thumb in the face of my</v>

55
00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 1>mother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although perhaps we're,</v>

56
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>we're all acting against our parents in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways.</v>

57
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more because it was,</v>

58
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conventional wisdom of the time in</v>

59
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>the late eighties and the early 1990s</v>
<v Speaker 1>that less fat was good,</v>

60
00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>less saturated fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good less animal fat,</v>

61
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 1>less cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more plant foods.</v>

62
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>So I assumed that if all those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>were true,</v>

63
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.510
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>a nonfat Vegan diet was probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best of all.</v>

65
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

66
00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.260
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I tried and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>things went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went along fine.</v>

68
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>No one would have called me sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

69
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.640
<v Speaker 1>but on Vegan and low fat diets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

70
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>my health suffered and I was 25 pounds</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavier than I am now.</v>

71
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And I had a host of minor minor</v>
<v Speaker 1>complaints,</v>

72
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

73
00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 1>and no one really would have ever called</v>
<v Speaker 1>me ill or,</v>

74
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 1>or certainly they wouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspected my perfect diet because I was</v>

75
00:03:40.511 --> 00:03:43.720
<v Speaker 1>not a junk food vegan or vegetarian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had brown rice and beans.</v>

76
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>olive oil,</v>

77
00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>light fruits and vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

78
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.110
<v Speaker 1>I just didn't eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.520
<v Speaker 1>many traditional foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

80
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:57.760
<v Speaker 1>how I now understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what brought me back to real food,</v>

81
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

82
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>was a wonderful serendipity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was living in London and I had started</v>

83
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the first American style farmer's</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets in London in 1999 and when I</v>

84
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>grew up in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Washington dc area,</v>

85
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:12.670
<v Speaker 1>at the farmer's markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were the vegetable people like us</v>

86
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and the fruit guys.</v>

87
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.340
<v Speaker 1>And then there was the plant lady and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the honey man and the baker at farmers</v>

88
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I started my first little farmer's</v>

89
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>market in London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had farmers even at my first little</v>

90
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:30.001
<v Speaker 1>market with only 16 producers selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>grass fed and pastured beef and lamb and</v>

91
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:35.020
<v Speaker 1>pork and chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were selling raw milk cheeses and</v>

92
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>cream and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sausages and meat pies.</v>

93
00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>And fish and all sorts of wonderful</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

94
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>So then I got a book contract and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to write the farmers' market</v>

95
00:04:44.951 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>cookbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had just been dabbling around with</v>

96
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>eggs and with fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was no longer Vegan and no longer</v>

97
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>a vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't eating.</v>

98
00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I was not yet a carnivore or an omnivore</v>
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>

99
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And so I didn't want to write a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian or even a fish and eggs</v>

100
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.730
<v Speaker 1>farmers' market cookbook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt I had to honor all the food</v>

101
00:05:06.731 --> 00:05:07.930
<v Speaker 1>producers at the markets.</v>

102
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And we'll the eaters as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>

103
00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I looked around and I saw that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the farmers have these wonderful</v>

104
00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:16.640
<v Speaker 1>traditional foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meat,</v>

105
00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.340
<v Speaker 1>eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dairy,</v>

106
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.910
<v Speaker 1>the fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

107
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.330
<v Speaker 1>we're healthy and happy people and seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to enjoy their food.</v>

108
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the eaters were healthy and happy</v>

109
00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>people and to certainly enjoyed all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those foods.</v>

110
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>And I began to wonder whether I</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't try these foods.</v>

111
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.760
<v Speaker 1>So for my cookbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried every food at our markets and</v>

112
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.400
<v Speaker 1>wrote recipes and ate all the recipes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was along the way that I slowly</v>

113
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>became a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an omnivore again.</v>

114
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with each food I ate with each fat,</v>

115
00:05:48.491 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>with each rich thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each red meat,</v>

116
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>with each forbidden and taboo thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would g w with each item that the</v>

117
00:05:54.821 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>cardiologists were banning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

118
00:05:57.651 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>in the u s and in Britain as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my health improved quite dramatically.</v>

119
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.210
<v Speaker 1>I lost 25 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to exercise as much.</v>

120
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>I used to run six miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

121
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>six times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd colds and flu and flu season.</v>

122
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.510
<v Speaker 1>My nails and hair and skin were dry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My digestion was terrible.</v>

123
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.660
<v Speaker 1>All of those problems melted away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

124
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>when I became an element of Oregon.</v>
