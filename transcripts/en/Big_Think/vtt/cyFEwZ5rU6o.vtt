00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So the first thing you need to do in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to reach your potential or do what</v>

2
00:00:07.521 --> 00:00:12.110
<v Speaker 1>you really meant to do is understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own strengths and weaknesses.</v>

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out that most people I</v>
<v Speaker 1>talked to do not know their strengths</v>

4
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>and weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They may be,</v>

5
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>can take a stab at their strengths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have a tough time writing down</v>

6
00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.710
<v Speaker 1>their weaknesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trap people fall in often is they</v>

7
00:00:27.711 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a class of 50 other people,</v>

8
00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>or I'm in a job with 20 other peers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ought to be able to be good at</v>

9
00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>everything they're good at if they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>good at something that I want to be good</v>

10
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is every,</v>

11
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:43.070
<v Speaker 1>every person is good at certain things</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a certain degree and not as good at</v>

12
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trick is to figure out your</v>

13
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>strengths and weaknesses and what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are you need to improve on.</v>

14
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to assess them versus a</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific job.</v>

15
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>If I want to be a newspaper reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain sets of strengths and</v>

16
00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses I need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I want to be an investment banker,</v>

17
00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:00.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a different set of I want to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>college professor.</v>

18
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>It's another set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need to understand your own</v>

19
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>strengths and weaknesses and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>calibrate it to what you need to do very</v>

20
00:01:08.061 --> 00:01:11.600
<v Speaker 1>well to be outstanding in that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out your strengths and</v>

21
00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses probably is not something you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do all by yourself.</v>

22
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>You need to get advice and observations</v>
<v Speaker 1>from people who watch you,</v>

23
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>who see you in action and can point out</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you what you're good at and what</v>

24
00:01:25.671 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you're not good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it helps to get advice</v>

25
00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>from others is we all have blind spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Problem is it has to be skill based.</v>

26
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>It can't be a morphis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can't be generalized needs to be</v>

27
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>based on skills that are relevant to</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever task you're doing.</v>

28
00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>And then ideally a coach would give you</v>
<v Speaker 1>some advice on techniques for improving</v>

29
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>the skills you need to be open to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing things that you don't want to</v>

30
00:01:46.971 --> 00:01:51.971
<v Speaker 1>hear and you need to not send off a vibe</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't want to hear.</v>

31
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Feedback.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mistakes people make as they either</v>

32
00:01:54.951 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>don't understand their own strengths and</v>
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses,</v>

33
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>they're not willing to get advice from</v>
<v Speaker 1>others to get feedback on what they're</v>

34
00:02:01.161 --> 00:02:05.090
<v Speaker 1>really good at and they don't calibrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>it against a job.</v>

35
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>What I'm trying to encourage people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do is do this systematically because</v>

36
00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:13.690
<v Speaker 1>your strengths and your weaknesses are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really the building blocks of what,</v>

37
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you're going to try to do.</v>
