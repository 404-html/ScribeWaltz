00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think so.</v>

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.423
<v Speaker 1>I mean you,</v>

3
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 2>I think it becomes really hard if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have like,</v>

4
00:00:16.911 --> 00:00:17.744
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>stringent rules about what you will and</v>
<v Speaker 2>won't do before you even hear the idea.</v>

6
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.931
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of stuff comes to us and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll start writing it and usually what</v>

8
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 2>we do is we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

9
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.960
<v Speaker 2>anything that cracks us up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

10
00:00:29.961 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>like if we're talking about something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all start laughing at it.</v>

11
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so we try to like,</v>

12
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we all laughing?</v>

13
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.530
<v Speaker 2>This seems like something that could be</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

15
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:41.710
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you start laughing and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you start writing it up and</v>

17
00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:42.650
<v Speaker 2>then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

18
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.450
<v Speaker 2>do I really want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

19
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:46.220
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do I really want to go and shoot that?</v>

20
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 2>Because that's going to be embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

21
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 2>we just sketched this year where I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>gay porn star and I get into a car</v>

22
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.630
<v Speaker 2>accident with Aziz and I die.</v>

23
00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he caused the accident so my ghost</v>

24
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 2>haunts him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everywhere he goes,</v>

25
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 2>there's this gay porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 2>like harassing him and doing really</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexual,</v>

27
00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 2>horrible things to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

28
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:09.201
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

29
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.810
<v Speaker 2>we wrote that and we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is hilarious.</v>

30
00:01:10.811 --> 00:01:13.070
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna be really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it comes time to shoot that,</v>

31
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.301
<v Speaker 2>and then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

32
00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I've got to do this.</v>

33
00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 2>So I had to like shave my entire body</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an oil at my body,</v>

34
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 2>and then just being all these really</v>
<v Speaker 2>awkward sexual positions with disease</v>

35
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Speaker 2>for long periods of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

36
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes you write stuff and then later</v>

37
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 2>on you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

38
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't have,</v>

39
00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't have written that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to,</v>

40
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:34.813
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be different.</v>

41
00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
