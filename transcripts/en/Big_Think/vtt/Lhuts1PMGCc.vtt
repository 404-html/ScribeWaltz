1
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>If I gave one piece of advice</v>

2
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>to the world about how to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases,</v>

3
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say have clear lines of</v>
<v Speaker 1>definition and demarcation and that</v>

4
00:00:23.641 --> 00:00:28.641
<v Speaker 1>makes it sound like I'm recommending</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise as number one because I want</v>

5
00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:34.461
<v Speaker 1>the absence of fat under the skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is the single most powerful</v>

6
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>generator of most diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affects cholesterol,</v>

7
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it affects triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that affects diabetes,</v>

8
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>therefore dialysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore blindness,</v>

9
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>therefore amputation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It affects cancers and so on.</v>

10
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.450
<v Speaker 1>So the best way to do that is of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put diet and exercise together as far</v>

11
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immunizations.</v>

13
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a question,</v>

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our culture that is mostly immunize</v>

15
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>those people who choose not to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>immunized or sort of living off the</v>

16
00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>benefits of those who did because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease incidence is low,</v>

17
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>but there have been several studies to</v>
<v Speaker 1>show that whooping cough epidemics have</v>

18
00:01:18.241 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>begun to occur in those populations who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not been immunized or adequately</v>

19
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:26.910
<v Speaker 1>immunized or recently enough been</v>
<v Speaker 1>immunized and whooping cough is nothing</v>

20
00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>to fool around with.</v>

21
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my children are grown and I don't know</v>

22
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>what I would do if the question were</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked me now,</v>

23
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want your kids immunized for all</v>

24
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:39.180
<v Speaker 1>of the things they're doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will say this,</v>

25
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>I would spread it out a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you need to jump in and</v>

26
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:48.111
<v Speaker 1>the first week or month and start the</v>
<v Speaker 1>immunization process as for seat belts</v>

27
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoiding too much sun and hence</v>

29
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>melanoma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be in the sun.</v>

30
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.960
<v Speaker 1>Vitamin D levels are very low in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

31
00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>You should be in the sun before 11:00 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>after 1:30.</v>

32
00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you need a great deal.</v>

33
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 1>You need a high vitamin D low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should not avoid the sun.</v>

34
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>You should be in the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happened?</v>

35
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:14.880
<v Speaker 1>If you've already developed a skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer of some variety,</v>

36
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>then you really need to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking vitamin D as a supplementation in</v>

37
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>our western culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think virtually everybody should</v>

38
00:02:24.001 --> 00:02:29.001
<v Speaker 1>probably be on vitamin D.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen one person who had a 25</v>

39
00:02:29.521 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>hydroxy vitamin D,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three level of 80,</v>

40
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>which is considered more or less the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best level.</v>

41
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>Everybody in my practice of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients is below that number,</v>

42
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>so I think just across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people need vitamin D.</v>

43
00:02:43.261 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a few people in the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not missing.</v>

45
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.980
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a genetic predisposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>to develop multiple disorders,</v>

46
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>but those disorders occur if only if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person does what's necessary to express</v>

47
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>that weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those people who are exercising</v>

48
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 1>adequate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually everyone who follows an</v>

49
00:03:09.461 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>organic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unprocessed whole foods diet that the 87</v>

50
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:17.371
<v Speaker 1>point five percent level and who</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises a an hour a day is going to</v>

51
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:21.580
<v Speaker 1>have the kind of physique that I've just</v>
<v Speaker 1>recommended.</v>

52
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's a lot of time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>

53
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>who has the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay me now or pay me later,</v>

54
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>do what you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll find out that you'll</v>

55
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>avoid diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Visit a high copays,</v>

56
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 1>high health insurance being rated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>your insurance,</v>

57
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 1>having surgery and so on and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you put the time in,</v>

58
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>now it's sort of like an education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put the time and now you get the</v>

59
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>benefit down the road,</v>

60
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>you should get a rectal examination for</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

61
00:03:53.861 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Of the prostate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think thermography is a better way for</v>

62
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:02.821
<v Speaker 1>women to go than mammograms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a heat registering technique that</v>

63
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>gives no radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a time and a place for a</v>

64
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>mammogram.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a time and a place for an MRI</v>

65
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>and of course now the big hot news about</v>
<v Speaker 1>cat scans and so on is that they are</v>

66
00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>cancer generating at about one in 500.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm a.</v>

67
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.740
<v Speaker 1>people over the age of 50 should get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonoscopy and people should be doing</v>

68
00:04:23.741 --> 00:04:28.741
<v Speaker 1>stool blood for a Globan Glo bin or</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's called a cult blood,</v>

69
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to detect cancers of the bow.</v>

70
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.010
<v Speaker 1>If you have stomach distress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intolerance,</v>

71
00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>you might need to be checked for a bug</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your stomach called h dot pylori or</v>

72
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:44.761
<v Speaker 1>wheat allergy called CELIAC disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these are some of the kinds of</v>

73
00:04:45.161 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everybody should get their</v>

74
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>cholesterol checked.</v>

75
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>Everybody should get their diabetes</v>
<v Speaker 1>checked.</v>

76
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>There are 25 hydro a diabetes test</v>
<v Speaker 1>called an a,</v>

77
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>one c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should get cholesterol,</v>

78
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 1>which should be less than 1:50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Triglycerides,</v>

79
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>which should be less than 100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A one C,</v>

80
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 1>which should be less than five point</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

81
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>25 Hydroxy d three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should be right around 80.</v>

82
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.810
<v Speaker 1>And those are some of the biochemical</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests that might be of interest for</v>

83
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.460
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

85
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>we've mentioned a colonoscopy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mammogram,</v>

86
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 1>rectal examination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pap and pelvic for women.</v>

87
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that as much as I have</v>

88
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:30.331
<v Speaker 1>hesitancy about the injection of foreign</v>
<v Speaker 1>proteins called immunizations,</v>

89
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>if I had a daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would want her immunized for</v>

90
00:05:34.361 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>HPV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

91
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't rush into it,</v>

92
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 1>but once you became sexually active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly want to have a</v>

93
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>discussion until she made a final</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision whether or not it should be my</v>

94
00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.560
<v Speaker 1>decision at this point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she doesn't have a voice in,</v>

95
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

96
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a different discussion.</v>

97
00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Disease reversal is not impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can reduce the weight of diabetics</v>

98
00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>and for all apparent reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:08.360
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

100
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.230
<v Speaker 1>their diabetes goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do the same for high blood</v>

101
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:13.290
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

102
00:06:13.291 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it in quotes.</v>

103
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.180
<v Speaker 1>Cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are doctors who argue against that</v>

104
00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 1>saying that you cannot cure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hypertension.</v>

105
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>You cannot cure diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you cannot cure high cholesterol.</v>

106
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very academic,</v>

107
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>whether you want to argue about can you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cure it or not,</v>

108
00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I can make all the signs of it go away</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reduce a person to Claude,</v>

109
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:35.750
<v Speaker 1>clear lines of definition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>demarcation.</v>

110
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Most diabetes will go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of hypertension will</v>

111
00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then of course,</v>

112
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to address salt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A salt intake has to be comparatively</v>

113
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.530
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

115
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 1>you have to address exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe that for the most part,</v>

116
00:06:54.761 --> 00:06:58.860
<v Speaker 1>diabetes can be reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost 90 percent of high cholesterol</v>

117
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.500
