00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're to human rights come from,</v>

2
00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you can say where do they write so</v>

3
00:00:12.941 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>the comatose come from or the babies</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>

4
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.900
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that within us we have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of moral purpose and we know</v>

5
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>innately most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether something seems right or seems</v>

6
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:30.981
<v Speaker 1>wrong and we have the rules that we live</v>
<v Speaker 1>our lives by which they do not do such</v>

7
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:37.311
<v Speaker 1>and such to some individual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may hurt to not be disrespectful and</v>

8
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:42.531
<v Speaker 1>I think that that has to extend beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>those we relate to most because the true</v>

9
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>test of compassion is if you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>decent to those,</v>

10
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:50.220
<v Speaker 1>you relate to least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe it comes from within us</v>

11
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.460
<v Speaker 1>from where we get kindness generally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're able to be altruistic to</v>

12
00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where it.</v>

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>We should extend that.</v>

14
00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
