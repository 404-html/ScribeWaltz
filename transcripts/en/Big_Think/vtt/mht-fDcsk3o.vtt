00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>Can I look back over time and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.440
<v Speaker 1>things are basically improved for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater lot of mankind.</v>

3
00:00:18.441 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>There's always been a lot of problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now they're acute and we're more</v>

4
00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:26.420
<v Speaker 1>interconnected and problems can infect</v>
<v Speaker 1>other parts of the world much more</v>

5
00:00:26.421 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But to date,</v>

6
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>the lot of mankind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe has generally gotten better.</v>

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>There's been big setbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at World War II,</v>

8
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 1>look at Chairman Mao's great leap</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 1>the dark ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in general,</v>

10
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>like the stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have a bull market in the bear</v>

11
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think in the end,</v>

12
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>problems can be dealt with and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind will continue to improve on a</v>

14
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>
