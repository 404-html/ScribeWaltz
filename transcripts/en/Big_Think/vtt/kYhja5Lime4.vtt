1
00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I think what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we have done at the college board,</v>

2
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:15.590
<v Speaker 1>if I could explain just a minute about</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the college board is,</v>

3
00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>because people somewhat kind of confused</v>
<v Speaker 1>about what we are,</v>

4
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>what we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are is first is that we're an</v>

5
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>organization that is preparing kids to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to college.</v>

6
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.130
<v Speaker 1>We have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have standards of what you need to</v>

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>doubt to go to college and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

8
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>We have curriculum from the sixth grade</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the 12th grade and math and English.</v>

9
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>We have the AP program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 37 subjects.</v>

10
00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.140
<v Speaker 1>So we have a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have standards and we have,</v>

11
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs that allow that.</v>

12
00:00:47.211 --> 00:00:50.860
<v Speaker 1>We prepare kids to go to college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we used to be just a,</v>

13
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual programs.</v>

14
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:58.001
<v Speaker 1>Now we're a system of programs that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can prove that we can really improve</v>

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>performance significantly and either a</v>
<v Speaker 1>state or school district or in school.</v>

16
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's part of what we do.</v>

17
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>The other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second part is how do you,</v>

18
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you affected the admissions</v>

19
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700
<v Speaker 1>not only do we provide the sat to</v>
<v Speaker 1>colleges and schools and students,</v>

21
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>but we also do a lot on financial aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do a lot of admissions.</v>

22
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Part of that's training center that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs to help administered.</v>

23
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>And the third thing is we have a program</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

24
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of innovation in research.</v>

25
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 1>That's the newest part of the college</v>
<v Speaker 1>board began about three years ago.</v>

26
00:01:32.751 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>We do studies on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on how you can improve community</v>

27
00:01:35.841 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>colleges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can employ,</v>

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>prove writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you can improve the process of</v>

29
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.790
<v Speaker 1>getting more students prepared and ready</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go to college.</v>

30
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>So that those are the three parts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

31
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>of the College Board.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that in Time magazine says</v>

32
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows that we're trying to make an</v>

33
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:58.070
<v Speaker 1>impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a substantial impact from preparing kids</v>

34
00:01:58.071 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>to go to college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

35
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process of,</v>

36
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of entering college and,</v>

37
00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 1>and then looking for ways that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the whole system by,</v>

38
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.150
<v Speaker 1>by innovation and research.</v>

39
00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 1>collegeboard.com was really begun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>really at the sort of the hyper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inner internet back about almost as</v>

41
00:02:22.991 --> 00:02:26.160
<v Speaker 1>an been almost nine years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

42
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 1>I wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I came to the college board,</v>

43
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.590
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things I did was to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create collegeboard.com cause I wanted</v>

44
00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>us to be on the cutting edge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been a really critical part of</v>

45
00:02:36.701 --> 00:02:39.220
<v Speaker 1>the growth and expansion of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the cause.</v>

46
00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:41.650
<v Speaker 1>But when I went to the college where we</v>
<v Speaker 1>had about 400 employees,</v>

47
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 1>we now have about 1200 employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

48
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.010
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

49
00:02:45.011 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 1>we've almost tripled what we've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we do today from what we did in</v>

51
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>part of that was because we had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to communicate to kids through</v>

52
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:54.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to students,</v>

53
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>through the Internet system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's been a very important,</v>

54
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>upgrade.</v>

55
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

56
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

57
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good service for parents and</v>

58
00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Speaker 1>students to better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better it,</v>

59
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>to sign up to get information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

60
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will become a bet bigger and more</v>

61
00:03:19.061 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>important thing for teachers to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

62
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:24.760
<v Speaker 1>And other educators to get information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's,</v>

63
00:03:24.761 --> 00:03:25.241
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

64
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's highly used.</v>

65
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's probably the,</v>

66
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>by far the busiest education website in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

67
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>it's given us a chance to speak to</v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

69
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and teachers and educators in a much</v>

70
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:43.320
<v Speaker 1>more effective way than we could have if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we hadn't had it.</v>
