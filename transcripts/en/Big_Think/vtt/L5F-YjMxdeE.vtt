1
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:08.660
<v Speaker 1>My name is Billy Collins</v>
<v Speaker 1>was born on West Thirtieth Street.</v>

2
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>I should point out that there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the need that was</v>

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>autobiographically shaped</v>

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 2>the persona that says my problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My persona has had.</v>

5
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 2>New York has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no influence on my persona.</v>

6
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

7
00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 2>it's influenced me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose just that.</v>

8
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:33.071
<v Speaker 2>And I grew up in a fairly</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmopolitan and crazy environment.</v>

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I guess I'm not too easily impressed by</v>
<v Speaker 2>eccentricity for one thing since if you</v>

11
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 2>walked down one block in Manhattan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

12
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like going into</v>

13
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 1>a lot of influences that young person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the parents,</v>

14
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably my father for his sense of</v>

15
00:00:57.961 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 2>humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a,</v>

16
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a joker.</v>

17
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 2>He had a lot of formal jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also had zingers.</v>

18
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Now these one liners that were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had enough zinger for every occasion and</v>

19
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 2>he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a practical joker as well.</v>

20
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have time to go into his</v>

21
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 2>practical drugs perhaps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but suffice it to say that the kind of</v>

22
00:01:20.971 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 2>pranks he pulled on office workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he worked on Wall Street,</v>

23
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would today be a,</v>

24
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 2>would qualify as psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>harassment?</v>

25
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in those days,</v>

26
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 2>the practical joke still was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think on prosecutable,</v>

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mother for her basically for more</v>

28
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 2>relevantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for interested in poetry.</v>

29
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was,</v>

30
00:01:45.991 --> 00:01:47.970
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents were born in 1901.</v>

31
00:01:47.971 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And they lived well into their nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of them.</v>

32
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 2>she was raised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>born and raised on a little farm in</v>

34
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 2>Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

35
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.810
<v Speaker 2>which is my big claim to ethnicity.</v>

36
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm half Canadian I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

37
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 2>but as a child she memorized a lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>poetry and the,</v>

38
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.290
<v Speaker 2>that was the thing to do in those days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Memorization was not thought of as old</v>

39
00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 2>hat or little red school house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as an adult,</v>

40
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

41
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 2>she was a storehouse of poetry and could</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce a lines of poetry for a,</v>

42
00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 2>just as my father had zinger for every</v>
<v Speaker 2>occasion she would have a few lines of</v>

43
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:31.180
<v Speaker 2>poetry forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>

44
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 2>every occasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So poetry was in the air,</v>

45
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:35.970
<v Speaker 2>it was in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in the house.</v>

46
00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

47
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>I was influenced by teachers of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

48
00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.040
<v Speaker 2>but one thing about ti about being</v>
<v Speaker 2>influenced by teachers,</v>

49
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 2>I can remember in terms of my poetry</v>
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>

50
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 2>a number of teachers who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 2>who encouraged me to keep writing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing like a innocent thing to do at</v>

52
00:02:56.821 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 2>the time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the teachers I really remember</v>

53
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 2>vividly a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were the two or three teachers who were</v>

54
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.260
<v Speaker 2>very discouraging to me and very</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismissive of my poetry and uh,</v>

55
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.740
<v Speaker 2>we're quick to tell me that it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but a bunch of teenage hormonal</v>

56
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:22.590
<v Speaker 2>overdrive or overspill and they might've</v>
<v Speaker 2>been right and an aesthetic literary</v>

57
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 2>critical sense.</v>

58
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they really inspired me to keep</v>

59
00:03:28.781 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to prove them wrong.</v>

60
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

61
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:38.911
<v Speaker 2>I know I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a much keener appetite for revenge than</v>

62
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:41.510
<v Speaker 2>I do for approval.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

63
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>so the teachers that approved to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I approval never meant that much to me.</v>

64
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I think I got so much from my mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't need outside approval.</v>

65
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.540
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 2>if you discouraged me a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would get me going.</v>

67
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:59.431
<v Speaker 2>And when I got a phone call from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Librarian of Congress in 2001 telling me</v>

68
00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 2>I was poet laureate of the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

69
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:07.740
<v Speaker 2>I thought of those teachers who</v>
<v Speaker 2>discouraged me and that added a little</v>

70
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>bit of sugar.</v>

71
00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

72
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.600
<v Speaker 2>she's the mother of us all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

73
00:04:18.601 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 2>those are the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

74
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.220
<v Speaker 2>writing poetry or painting or dancing or</v>
<v Speaker 2>playing the trumpet a.</v>

75
00:04:26.761 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 2>all of these activities that we consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

76
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.960
<v Speaker 2>for lack of a better name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really,</v>

77
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just extensions of natural childhood,</v>

78
00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>activities that childhood desires that</v>

79
00:04:45.571 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 2>are enacted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

80
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 2>as children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are painters,</v>

81
00:04:48.841 --> 00:04:52.980
<v Speaker 2>dancers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just give a kid a flute and he'll start</v>

82
00:04:52.981 --> 00:04:54.020
<v Speaker 2>playing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

83
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.490
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and writers,</v>

84
00:04:56.491 --> 00:05:01.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean all children love rhyme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think poets are artists who just are</v>

85
00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:06.711
<v Speaker 2>just people who somehow didn't allow</v>
<v Speaker 2>that natural ability in childhood to be</v>

86
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.550
<v Speaker 2>killed off by bad teaching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The self consciousness of adolescence</v>

87
00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 2>goes</v>

88
00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.000
<v Speaker 1>down the drain.</v>
