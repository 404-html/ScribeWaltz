1
00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Levies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cough before who said that?</v>

2
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Her cooking in the process by which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:17.581 --> 00:00:21.750
<v Speaker 1>nature is stress home into culture and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European civilization,</v>

4
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tetany you can go back and anything can</v>

5
00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>be filtered through the food itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

6
00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>after apology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even politic,</v>

8
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have political decision,</v>

9
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like uh,</v>

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.351
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

11
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the taxal Gabrielle in France in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>17th century for that tax on salt,</v>

12
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>those are political decision who decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the food goes or other food is</v>

13
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>going to be consumed or the embargo of</v>
<v Speaker 1>color in the 70s.</v>

14
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the grant out of Agu,</v>

15
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain country of Europe,</v>

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>this political decision as we see in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

17
00:00:58.081 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another part of the world will determine</v>

18
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>where the food goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who die and new style and who die and</v>

19
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:05.611
<v Speaker 1>you leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

20
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So those are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's political,</v>

21
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.510
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:10.760
<v Speaker 1>food can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>the Bible is an enormous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>so for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for food or for,</v>

25
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 1>for a eastery of food if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.430
<v Speaker 1>so whether it's sociology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no,</v>

27
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>no part of social science which cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>be really filtered through food.</v>

28
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And to a certain extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it become a subject which is more</v>

29
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>not only irrelevant but more respected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

30
00:01:32.071 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>at Boston University we are offering now</v>
<v Speaker 1>a master of liberal arts with a</v>

31
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>concentration in gastronomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 1>that would have been totally unthinkable</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

33
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.490
<v Speaker 1>30 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even less than that when I came to</v>

34
00:01:44.491 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>America and I work at the Perio</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trashcans,</v>

35
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you're the greatest French restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and was part of [inaudible] 89 and</v>

36
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:53.670
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] 89 where the dishwasher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chef,</v>

37
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>the cook to everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in the same basket.</v>

38
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>There was no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>

39
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to say that after,</v>

40
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

41
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pavilion year I worked for Howard</v>

42
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Johnson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work with a lot of black people,</v>

43
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We understood the still,</v>

44
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>that's what I wear the most into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kitchen.</v>

45
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.270
<v Speaker 1>And now that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.590
<v Speaker 1>the cooking had exploded and I'd become</v>
<v Speaker 1>very glamorous and inspired and even</v>

47
00:02:19.681 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

48
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.380
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason,</v>

51
00:02:25.381 --> 00:02:29.640
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's a lost for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have many black who are into</v>

52
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>cooking now a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but not many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but many young American chef are in that</v>

54
00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>business now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as I say,</v>

55
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:36.481
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they go,</v>

56
00:02:36.481 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>they would not even a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was considered a lou and inspire</v>

57
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>type of a job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which now it's exactly the opposite.</v>

58
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>So we have the peregrination of the chef</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite interesting because something</v>

59
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.500
<v Speaker 1>happened in the same way in the 17th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18th century in France.</v>

60
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.190
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a book written by [inaudible]</v>

61
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.790
<v Speaker 1>in the first half of the 18th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called a nouvelle cuisine for</v>

62
00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>the new French cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you see the nouvelle cuisine,</v>

63
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>which erupted here in the 70s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what already existing in the,</v>

64
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.221
<v Speaker 1>in the 1870 when it went down and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why that Tan attacks again during,</v>

65
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during,</v>

66
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time of the belly pork,</v>

67
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>then it went down and up again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's an interesting,</v>

68
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to look at the story of cooking</v>

69
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>a great deal of the cooking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>discharging in baby even more so now,</v>

70
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is good and there is bad certainly</v>

71
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.900
<v Speaker 1>thing like the food processor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Seran wrap and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

73
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 1>plastic or a rubber spatula after me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great Innovation of the last 30 years.</v>

75
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

76
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>besides this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>we always manipulate food and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our ancestor,</v>

78
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.420
<v Speaker 1>didn't have anything to eat and what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>call weak now was actually a wild the</v>

80
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.090
<v Speaker 1>while the weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>which through a cross breeding and</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenging and manipulation.</v>

82
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>We ended up now with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not that long ago,</v>

83
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>whenever the child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could not eat string bean before</v>

84
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>string on one side and the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I tried to do and I had to do a</v>

85
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>couple of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pound or whatever that my mother wanted</v>

87
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:25.120
<v Speaker 1>me to do.</v>

88
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 1>My brother and I tried to cut the end of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it with a scissor to which of course</v>

89
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>those beans were absolutely or needle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now there is always been so many</v>

90
00:04:32.771 --> 00:04:36.260
<v Speaker 1>potential to make it a better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

91
00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.990
<v Speaker 1>without the string or to make the animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>fatter or not as fat or more tender or</v>

92
00:04:40.991 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>this and that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those manipulation of existing all</v>

93
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 1>the time now bio engineered food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something else.</v>

94
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] we get into other area which</v>

95
00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>asked to be control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am not by a definition oposed to</v>

96
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>anything because I think that to feed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

97
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.440
<v Speaker 1>we need that type of improvement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has to be extremely controlled,</v>

98
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But without any question,</v>

99
00:05:04.421 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>if you can do an egg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which tastes like an egg for me are good</v>

100
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:11.090
<v Speaker 1>and an egg and it has half of the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cholesterol,</v>

101
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

102
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a tomato,</v>

103
00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:18.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because of so many progression</v>

104
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.580
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need to be sprayed with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>insecticide and pesticide or leasing</v>

105
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>being resistant to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not that?</v>

106
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as I say,</v>

107
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>you have to do it with circumspection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've really have to control it.</v>
