1
00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.550
<v Speaker 1>He currently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a professor of biology at Mit.</v>

2
00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Gee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I was actually more inclined towards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe mathematics,</v>

5
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than biology.</v>

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.093
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in high school I never studied biology </v>

7
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>at all because I found it much too soft </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a science.</v>

8
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.093
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it was a characterization of a </v>

9
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.350
<v Speaker 1>taxonomy and species and phylon stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I find it totally boring.</v>

10
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>But in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.010
<v Speaker 1>at Mit when I was a freshman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was planning to major in,</v>

12
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly chemistry.</v>

13
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.771
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:51.604
<v Speaker 1>I learned that there was this new thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>called molecular biology that was just </v>

15
00:00:55.481 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>emerging and that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very exciting.</v>

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>So I decided to try it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

17
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:02.314
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended up majoring in biology a while </v>

18
00:01:05.051 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>taking a lot of chemistry courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

19
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was probably a very good </v>

20
00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:10.834
<v Speaker 1>decision because I think the life </v>
<v Speaker 1>science has really have blossomed </v>

21
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:15.640
<v Speaker 1>tremendously in the past 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

22
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:16.474
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is really the golden age now </v>

23
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:19.204
<v Speaker 1>for biology.</v>

24
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.783
<v Speaker 1>That came a little bit later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had been on the faculty at Mit for </v>

25
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 1>about six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years.</v>

26
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I had tenure and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>it gave me an opportunity to think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something a little bit risky,</v>

28
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of high risk,</v>

29
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.003
<v Speaker 1>high reward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I spent several years thinking what </v>

30
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:49.161
<v Speaker 1>are some problems out there in biology </v>
<v Speaker 1>now that would fit into that category.</v>

31
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.490
<v Speaker 1>I thought about a lot of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 1>including learning and memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought aging was,</v>

34
00:01:56.881 --> 00:01:57.714
<v Speaker 1>was interesting because obviously it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an extremely important and it wasn't </v>

35
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.453
<v Speaker 1>being studied systematically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was being studied from the point of </v>

36
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>view of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>comparing old and young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>and mainly in the medical community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of the aging process itself</v>

39
00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>and moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what might control the aging process?</v>

40
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

41
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>it was a little bit known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

42
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>So it looked like a perfect opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>but one that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had considerable risk.</v>

44
00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>What made me decide to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>get into it is it turned out so my lab </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at that point,</v>

46
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>

47
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the organism yeast.</v>

48
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.703
<v Speaker 1>And I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a yeast biologists and we had studied </v>

49
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>various aspects of cell and molecular </v>
<v Speaker 1>biology in yeast.</v>

50
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what gained me tenure </v>
<v Speaker 1>at Mit.</v>

51
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.330
<v Speaker 1>And it turned out that yeast cells get </v>
<v Speaker 1>old they age.</v>

52
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.200
<v Speaker 1>So this was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

53
00:02:58.201 --> 00:02:59.034
<v Speaker 1>a perfect entry point to the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could begin by studying how yeast </v>

54
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>cells get old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we did.</v>

55
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>Now we started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bashing away at this problem,</v>

57
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in yeast,</v>

58
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the idea that we could find genes,</v>

59
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:19.174
<v Speaker 1>single genes that could confer extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity to yeast cells that are </v>

60
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>dividing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you cells divide,</v>

61
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.713
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Baker's yeast that I'm talking </v>

62
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kind of Iste would use to make bread</v>

63
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>or wine or spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out they're very,</v>

64
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>very good system to study in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratory,</v>

65
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at cell biology.</v>

66
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>Now when these cells divide what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

67
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>interestingly of course you get two </v>
<v Speaker 1>salads from one cell,</v>

68
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.713
<v Speaker 1>but they're different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is called the mother cell and it's </v>

69
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>big and the other is called the daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>cell.</v>

70
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.053
<v Speaker 1>And it's small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out the daughter cell is </v>

71
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.993
<v Speaker 1>all newly synthesized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the material and the daughter is </v>

72
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:58.234
<v Speaker 1>new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mother cell retains the old </v>

73
00:04:00.761 --> 00:04:01.240
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

74
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.073
<v Speaker 1>So that mother cell will then give </v>
<v Speaker 1>another daughter and another daughter </v>

75
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.124
<v Speaker 1>and every generation it will be getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and it does that about 20 times </v>

76
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>and then it hits the wall and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Senescence.</v>

77
00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

78
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 1>so it really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

79
00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.570
<v Speaker 1>they're really was aging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be in,</v>

80
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.404
<v Speaker 1>in a a very baroque system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we thought we would be able to make </v>

81
00:04:21.371 --> 00:04:22.204
<v Speaker 1>some headway potentially and identifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least what controls this process in </v>

82
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.154
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

83
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exotic,</v>

84
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.243
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

85
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's really what intrigued me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had,</v>

86
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.053
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

88
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.283
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.133
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plan to study aging more generally then </v>

90
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>yeast that came as we got deeper and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper into the problem.</v>

91
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem,</v>

92
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.001
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

93
00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:49.834
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with this field and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what has bedeviled this field over the </v>

94
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.443
<v Speaker 1>years is false claims.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are all kinds of things that </v>

95
00:04:59.201 --> 00:05:01.580
<v Speaker 1>have been claimed about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

96
00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways you can slow down or stop aging.</v>

97
00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:08.620
<v Speaker 1>And what I would say they have in common</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

98
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and until,</v>

99
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

100
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was claimed,</v>

101
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>that's not based on very recent science </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not true.</v>

102
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.430
<v Speaker 1>It's Baloney.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

103
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I wouldn't believe any claim,</v>

104
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an anti aging procedure,</v>

105
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

106
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.953
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

107
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:26.793
<v Speaker 1>would really look at claims that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounded in current science because I </v>

108
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:36.361
<v Speaker 1>think the science of aging has really </v>
<v Speaker 1>only taken off in the past decade and it</v>

109
00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.073
<v Speaker 1>has reached a level of quality that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can trust it and that it would lead to </v>

110
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.020
<v Speaker 1>interventions that would actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's only happened recently.</v>

111
00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing to look at it,</v>

112
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 1>any claim like this vitamin or that </v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment or that,</v>

113
00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

114
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.520
<v Speaker 1>bath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be or cream,</v>

115
00:05:58.910 --> 00:05:59.743
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it based on the recent science of </v>

116
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>aging or not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not,</v>

117
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>I would tend not to believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it is,</v>

118
00:06:08.271 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>I would look at whether it's based on </v>
<v Speaker 1>good science or not.</v>

119
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>But there is some good science now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the area of aging.</v>

120
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

121
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

122
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>what they're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good example.</v>

123
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.980
<v Speaker 1>I think of something that's not based on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a recent science in the field of aging.</v>

124
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.150
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

125
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

126
00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that there's any reason to</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that it's true.</v>

127
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may turn out that it is true.</v>

128
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.323
<v Speaker 1>I mean his basic ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to make incremental </v>

129
00:06:43.011 --> 00:06:43.844
<v Speaker 1>discoveries in agent that will make us </v>
<v Speaker 1>live a little bit longer and give us a </v>

130
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:50.150
<v Speaker 1>little bit more time to make the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovery,</v>

131
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.343
<v Speaker 1>which will make us live still longer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll make more discoveries and so </v>

132
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>on and so on and so on and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

133
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.940
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.430
<v Speaker 1>that would be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

135
00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly not scientific thinking</v>

136
00:07:03.921 --> 00:07:04.754
<v Speaker 1>and that's not based on current science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that what we're talking </v>

137
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:10.034
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you look at all the genetic </v>

138
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:16.691
<v Speaker 1>interventions that have been described </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should really get into discussing</v>

139
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 1>some of that in a few minutes and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dietary interventions that have been</v>

140
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:24.640
<v Speaker 1>described that promote longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

141
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 1>what you looking at is something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>50% as a maximum extension?</v>

142
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would think so.</v>

143
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing to sneeze at and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

144
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think,</v>

145
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>accompanied by an increase in the number</v>

146
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.203
<v Speaker 1>of years we stay healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we can tap into that and even </v>

147
00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 1>develop it so that we get some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>

148
00:07:49.761 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years of healthier living.</v>

149
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>So instead of having to retire and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.873
<v Speaker 1>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.360
<v Speaker 1>functioning at a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at age 70 or 75,</v>

152
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 1>you push that back now 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a,</v>

153
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:06.810
<v Speaker 1>a major,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

154
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:12.280
<v Speaker 1>change in our society aging process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

155
00:08:13.980 --> 00:08:17.180
<v Speaker 1>you can describe it statistically in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of,</v>

156
00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality curves.</v>

157
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.400
<v Speaker 1>what that means is that the probability </v>
<v Speaker 1>of dying increases,</v>

159
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:27.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your age.</v>

160
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.543
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>degenerative process that's occurring </v>

161
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>and cells and tissues that makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

162
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

163
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>increasingly less robust as you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>older and,</v>

164
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:45.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opens up the doors to diseases of aging,</v>

165
00:08:45.651 --> 00:08:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the major diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes,</v>

166
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer,</v>

167
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>osteoporosis,</v>

168
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:55.520
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually will kill you.</v>

170
00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:58.260
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

171
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 1>it's a very pervasive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>process that has many,</v>

173
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.860
<v Speaker 1>many things going wrong all at the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

174
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

175
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:13.790
<v Speaker 1>you're talking to somebody who is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:15.500
<v Speaker 1>not unbiased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

177
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>in this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

178
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I think the search villains have really </v>
<v Speaker 1>been to my mind,</v>

180
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a completely unexpected,</v>

181
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>a new thing to come along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

182
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:34.490
<v Speaker 1>this came from the studies and yeast </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I described a few minutes ago where</v>

183
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.334
<v Speaker 1>we were looking for aging genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And after about nine years of doing </v>

184
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:42.204
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first nine years we started working </v>

185
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.174
<v Speaker 1>in this area about 19 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first nine years were spent in </v>

186
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>yeast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to find the right Jean.</v>

187
00:09:51.661 --> 00:09:55.620
<v Speaker 1>And we came upon a gene called cert two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cert two,</v>

188
00:09:55.621 --> 00:10:00.621
<v Speaker 1>gene was an anti aging gene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is when you made</v>

189
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it more active,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cells live longer,</v>

190
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.890
<v Speaker 1>they divided more times when you made it</v>
<v Speaker 1>less active,</v>

191
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.760
<v Speaker 1>they lived less long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this looked like a really interesting</v>

192
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>gene and it was the only gene that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>came across that did this.</v>

193
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we thought it was interesting.</v>

194
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Then we carried out a similar kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>

195
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a different organism that people </v>

196
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.470
<v Speaker 1>study in the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roundworm see Alec Gans.</v>

197
00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.770
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking are there any genes in the</v>

198
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:36.771
<v Speaker 1>genome c elegans that are anti aging </v>
<v Speaker 1>genes and we've got the same gene.</v>

199
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.130
<v Speaker 1>We got a gene that has the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>sequence,</v>

200
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:41.993
<v Speaker 1>similar sequence as the cert too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's an amazing finding because </v>

201
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.273
<v Speaker 1>what it means is if the Sir two gene is </v>
<v Speaker 1>counteracting aging in yeast and in </v>

202
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:53.394
<v Speaker 1>worms that it's doing that universally </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that would include mammals and it </v>

203
00:10:56.851 --> 00:10:57.684
<v Speaker 1>would include us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it really right away speaks to a </v>

204
00:11:00.721 --> 00:11:01.554
<v Speaker 1>universality of this process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's one thing that's </v>

205
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:06.234
<v Speaker 1>highly significant about this is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gene is conserved and we think its </v>

206
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:12.950
<v Speaker 1>effect on the aging process is </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

207
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the piece of this that makes it,</v>

208
00:11:18.691 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 1>I think particularly exciting as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

209
00:11:21.511 --> 00:11:22.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

210
00:11:22.201 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 1>there's this gene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

211
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:25.470
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

212
00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.680
<v Speaker 1>makes you live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's more active,</v>

213
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:29.851
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

214
00:11:29.851 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>why should that be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this gene actually do?</v>

215
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.230
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we know is genes of course,</v>

216
00:11:37.290 --> 00:11:38.123
<v Speaker 1>are the blueprint to specify proteins </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Sir two genes and code </v>

217
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 1>particular proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proteins are called Sirtuin.</v>

218
00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're really,</v>

219
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 1>really eager to try and figure out what </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cert actually dead in Sal's.</v>

220
00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:01.140
<v Speaker 1>And just almost exactly 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit more than 10 years ago,</v>

221
00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:06.840
<v Speaker 1>we discovered it and they have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>enzymatic activity in south that enables</v>

222
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.863
<v Speaker 1>them to modify other proteins in cells </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that can really change the </v>

223
00:12:12.281 --> 00:12:15.220
<v Speaker 1>metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the physiology of a cell,</v>

224
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.410
<v Speaker 1>and then by extension of entire tissues </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an entire organism.</v>

225
00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:21.573
<v Speaker 1>But the critical thing about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity is that it was completely </v>

226
00:12:24.941 --> 00:12:29.941
<v Speaker 1>coupled to this small metabolic molecule</v>
<v Speaker 1>in cells called Nad.</v>

227
00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.953
<v Speaker 1>So the activity of cert tunes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is called deacetylation of other </v>

228
00:12:36.071 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 1>proteins is absolutely under control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nad.</v>

229
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.660
<v Speaker 1>No Nad sort tunes are dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

230
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So the naed links started two wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two diet and metabolism because diet and</v>

231
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:53.230
<v Speaker 1>metabolism affect the availability of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ned in south.</v>

232
00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.663
<v Speaker 1>So we came up with a hypothesis 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago when we discovered this activity </v>

233
00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.173
<v Speaker 1>that Serotonin's might be really be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>link between how diet affects how long </v>

234
00:13:09.371 --> 00:13:13.720
<v Speaker 1>you live and how diet affects your </v>
<v Speaker 1>predisposition to diseases.</v>

235
00:13:14.290 --> 00:13:15.101
<v Speaker 1>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

236
00:13:15.101 --> 00:13:15.934
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.153
<v Speaker 1>I think a radical idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are a lot of people out </v>

238
00:13:21.221 --> 00:13:22.810
<v Speaker 1>there still critical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't believe it.</v>

239
00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the data is mountain in mice</v>

240
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.290
<v Speaker 1>particularly that says that this may </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually be true.</v>

241
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.270
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea would be uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that on a low calorie diet,</v>

242
00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.700
<v Speaker 1>a diet that's been term calorie </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction,</v>

243
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.260
<v Speaker 1>we know that rodents live longer and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they resist diseases,</v>

244
00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:46.261
<v Speaker 1>they're disease free under this diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we suggest that the reason for that,</v>

245
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:50.770
<v Speaker 1>at least one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main reasons is that this low</v>

246
00:13:50.771 --> 00:13:51.604
<v Speaker 1>calorie diet activate Sirtuin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's via this molecule nad and that the </v>

247
00:13:57.221 --> 00:13:58.054
<v Speaker 1>more active cert tunes then promote </v>
<v Speaker 1>better survival and better ability to </v>

248
00:14:02.771 --> 00:14:03.880
<v Speaker 1>ward off diseases.</v>

249
00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:05.133
<v Speaker 1>So that's a very simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hypothesis that came from identifying </v>

250
00:14:08.561 --> 00:14:12.040
<v Speaker 1>this activity that I mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one.</v>

251
00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:12.903
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that came out of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is once you have an understanding of </v>

252
00:14:19.541 --> 00:14:20.374
<v Speaker 1>what a protein does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can actually measure that in a </v>

253
00:14:23.021 --> 00:14:23.854
<v Speaker 1>test tube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that just has that protein and in </v>

254
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:27.394
<v Speaker 1>this case Nad at enabled you to screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>for drugs for small molecules that can </v>

255
00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:32.584
<v Speaker 1>enhance that activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it opened the door for looking for </v>

256
00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.790
<v Speaker 1>small molecules that could upregulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the activity of [inaudible].</v>

257
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:45.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's led to sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a flood of,</v>

258
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of interest.</v>

259
00:14:47.381 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 1>I think probably the part of the story </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gotten the greatest notice in the</v>

260
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:52.694
<v Speaker 1>press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first screens that were done </v>

261
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.990
<v Speaker 1>identified a molecule found in red wine </v>
<v Speaker 1>called resveratrol.</v>

262
00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>That's of a class of compounds that </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants make and response to stress.</v>

263
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:06.620
<v Speaker 1>They're called polyphenols.</v>

264
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.700
<v Speaker 1>And these compounds could activate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.983
<v Speaker 1>the search doing in a test tube and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>also could make cells live longer east </v>

266
00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:21.601
<v Speaker 1>cells and could make worms live longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the remarkable thing,</v>

267
00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:23.173
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to be that not only our cert tunes </v>

268
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.113
<v Speaker 1>able to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we might actually be able to </v>

269
00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:29.640
<v Speaker 1>influence their activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

270
00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.850
<v Speaker 1>from outside with drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that really is a,</v>

271
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:34.910
<v Speaker 1>I think where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

272
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.833
<v Speaker 1>excitement began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's still a building because I </v>

273
00:15:38.211 --> 00:15:41.360
<v Speaker 1>think if this is still not completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate it yet,</v>

274
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:42.763
<v Speaker 1>so that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are natural products that </v>

275
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:47.120
<v Speaker 1>resveratrol and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polyphenols,</v>

276
00:15:47.121 --> 00:15:47.954
<v Speaker 1>the things that are found in wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But a company was started by David </v>

277
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.480
<v Speaker 1>Sinclair and Christof Westfall called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sirtris about,</v>

278
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.433
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six years ago to try and look for new </v>

279
00:15:59.811 --> 00:16:03.320
<v Speaker 1>kinds of molecules now that are not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural products.</v>

280
00:16:03.321 --> 00:16:04.154
<v Speaker 1>They're not found in nature by screening</v>
<v Speaker 1>through libraries of different chemical </v>

281
00:16:07.521 --> 00:16:08.354
<v Speaker 1>compounds that have been synthesized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are new kinds of activators </v>

282
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 1>now of cert two wins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new chemicals that can activate the much</v>

283
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.634
<v Speaker 1>more potently than risk very trial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's going to be extremely exciting </v>

284
00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.540
<v Speaker 1>to test these molecules and see what </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do.</v>

285
00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.403
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we know is both resveratrol and </v>

286
00:16:30.231 --> 00:16:32.120
<v Speaker 1>some of these newer compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

287
00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:36.590
<v Speaker 1>have beneficial effects in mice and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do in minds.</v>

288
00:16:36.591 --> 00:16:39.800
<v Speaker 1>They've been tested against various </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

289
00:16:39.801 --> 00:16:44.480
<v Speaker 1>So what we would expect is if these </v>
<v Speaker 1>molecules are really activating sirtuins</v>

290
00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.240
<v Speaker 1>and can protect against diseases of </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging,</v>

291
00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.880
<v Speaker 1>then we should be able to demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in a mouse.</v>

292
00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>So it turns out if you feed a mouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

293
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.923
<v Speaker 1>basically a bad diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite of a calorie restricted </v>

294
00:16:56.631 --> 00:16:58.370
<v Speaker 1>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a diet high in fat,</v>

295
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:01.910
<v Speaker 1>high in calories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mice get diabetes,</v>

296
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.553
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it turns out these molecules </v>

297
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 1>resveratrol and the newer compounds that</v>
<v Speaker 1>activate the cert two wins,</v>

298
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:12.860
<v Speaker 1>they can protect the mouse against </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes.</v>

299
00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.940
<v Speaker 1>So the mouse will still eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mouse will still even get fat.</v>

300
00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll stay metabolically healthy.</v>

301
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 1>So that's a pretty good demonstration </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

302
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea is not so far out,</v>

303
00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there really is an opportunity </v>

304
00:17:29.211 --> 00:17:34.211
<v Speaker 1>here to use drugs to keep metabolism </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong and intact as in the face of,</v>

305
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

306
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.520
<v Speaker 1>caloric excess.</v>

307
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even more importantly,</v>

308
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.460
<v Speaker 1>for many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like myself who already,</v>

309
00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't calorie restrict,</v>

310
00:17:47.181 --> 00:17:49.590
<v Speaker 1>but I don't eat to access either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm in good shape,</v>

311
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.760
<v Speaker 1>but even someone like myself would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to get benefit from these,</v>

312
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:54.743
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these molecules by activating sirtuins </v>

313
00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:58.890
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the benefit that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>already getting,</v>

314
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.040
<v Speaker 1>my keeping myself in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's very,</v>

315
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very promising area of research.</v>

316
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.990
<v Speaker 1>And this company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the small company called [inaudible] was</v>

317
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:14.220
<v Speaker 1>bought by one of the giants in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical industry.</v>

318
00:18:14.221 --> 00:18:19.170
<v Speaker 1>She asked k for something like three </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarters of $1 billion a year ago.</v>

319
00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.590
<v Speaker 1>So obviously that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

320
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.733
<v Speaker 1>there's at least some validation in big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pharma that these ideas are realistic </v>

321
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.740
<v Speaker 1>and will be brought to fruition.</v>

322
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:36.380
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

323
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:37.253
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my lab works on really uncertain ruins </v>

324
00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:41.280
<v Speaker 1>and I think with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so much to be done.</v>

325
00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.390
<v Speaker 1>So what we know now is just as the tip </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the iceberg about Sir tones.</v>

326
00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are seven of them in people.</v>

327
00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so far,</v>

328
00:18:50.551 --> 00:18:53.340
<v Speaker 1>most of the studies have been focused on</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one of those seven.</v>

329
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:54.833
<v Speaker 1>Second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many tissues that have to be </v>

330
00:18:57.541 --> 00:18:58.374
<v Speaker 1>studied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we know what the cert two winds are </v>

331
00:18:59.461 --> 00:19:03.620
<v Speaker 1>doing in each and every tissue so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we know what the effects of the drug are</v>

332
00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:05.010
<v Speaker 1>going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tissue by tissue.</v>

333
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's gonna take a long time.</v>

334
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.070
<v Speaker 1>So we're deeply involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third thing is,</v>

335
00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.173
<v Speaker 1>will these cert two to really protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>against many diseases or will they just </v>

336
00:19:16.951 --> 00:19:19.680
<v Speaker 1>protect against metabolic diseases like </v>
<v Speaker 1>diabetes?</v>

337
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:20.873
<v Speaker 1>So my lab is really focused focus now on</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurodegenerative diseases and we're </v>

338
00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:28.950
<v Speaker 1>testing the effect of activating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

339
00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.030
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major,</v>

340
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human cert two in which is called </v>

341
00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]. [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>has also been called the survival gene.</v>

342
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.063
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're interested in what if we </v>

343
00:19:38.011 --> 00:19:38.844
<v Speaker 1>activate this and the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will it protect the mouse against </v>

344
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:45.390
<v Speaker 1>Alzheimer's disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against Parkinson's disease,</v>

345
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.433
<v Speaker 1>against Huntington's disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think these are extremely </v>

346
00:19:48.781 --> 00:19:52.590
<v Speaker 1>important questions because that will </v>
<v Speaker 1>define the sculpt of,</v>

347
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:53.443
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're able to think about here and </v>

348
00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.770
<v Speaker 1>what we can start to attack </v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmacologically.</v>

349
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

350
00:20:03.241 --> 00:20:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I think a low calorie diet is probably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>

351
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in humans,</v>

352
00:20:10.081 --> 00:20:10.914
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no data on what a low calorie </v>

353
00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:16.800
<v Speaker 1>diet does in terms of diseases and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

354
00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.510
<v Speaker 1>longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

355
00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by analogy to rodents,</v>

356
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:22.423
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think it would be a good </v>

357
00:20:22.921 --> 00:20:24.150
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

358
00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it made you really miserable to eat a</v>

359
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.230
<v Speaker 1>thousand calories a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

360
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.590
<v Speaker 1>and people who are on that diet tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be cold.</v>

361
00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:34.080
<v Speaker 1>They tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

362
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 1>have a very low sex drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to,</v>

363
00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:41.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some cases be irritable.</v>

364
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:42.563
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're not happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that gets back to what we were </v>

365
00:20:44.791 --> 00:20:48.040
<v Speaker 1>saying earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be undoing some of the good,</v>

366
00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.421
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

367
00:20:49.421 --> 00:20:50.460
<v Speaker 1>that diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

368
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
<v Speaker 1>would otherwise produce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my feeling is to live sense of way.</v>

369
00:20:57.671 --> 00:21:00.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean the work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what advice that I think is good.</v>

370
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.580
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think what everybody should do,</v>

371
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.600
<v Speaker 1>if everybody could do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

372
00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.573
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the best you can do right now is </v>

373
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:13.510
<v Speaker 1>decide what is your perfect weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body weight,</v>

374
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:16.900
<v Speaker 1>what's perfect for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think what most people do is rifle</v>

375
00:21:16.901 --> 00:21:18.630
<v Speaker 1>through the past and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

376
00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:20.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the side,</v>

377
00:21:20.621 --> 00:21:21.071
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

378
00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:25.960
<v Speaker 1>when they were most happy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and do everything possible to</v>

379
00:21:25.961 --> 00:21:29.230
<v Speaker 1>get to that weight and keep to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that that would,</v>

380
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

381
00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:31.870
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

382
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.170
<v Speaker 1>make you healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people healthier than they are now.</v>

383
00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond that,</v>

384
00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

385
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.230
<v Speaker 1>I take a vitamin supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a general supplement,</v>

386
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take vitamin D,</v>

387
00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:47.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not take resveratrol.</v>

388
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:48.700
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people do.</v>

389
00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is I'm waiting for a 100%</v>

390
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:58.720
<v Speaker 1>pure and reliable source of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>I will take it.</v>

391
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

392
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:06.070
<v Speaker 1>I drink a little wine and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the data says,</v>

393
00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.840
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an optimum,</v>

394
00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:10.810
<v Speaker 1>I think the data says that too much wine</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bad,</v>

395
00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but no wine is not optima.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The right amount of wine,</v>

396
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is optimum theirs up center in Louisiana</v>

397
00:22:22.571 --> 00:22:25.060
<v Speaker 1>called the Pennington Center that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

398
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing such studies.</v>

399
00:22:26.261 --> 00:22:27.094
<v Speaker 1>It's been a long time since there's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>good data on humans on a calorie </v>

400
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:33.970
<v Speaker 1>restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And part of the problem has been that,</v>

401
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans tend to cheat on the Diet.</v>

402
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:41.140
<v Speaker 1>So a controlled studies end up not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>so controlled.</v>

403
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:42.533
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but recently there have been six months </v>

404
00:22:44.231 --> 00:22:47.980
<v Speaker 1>studies done and what you can do in six </v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

405
00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:49.930
<v Speaker 1>you can't ask if it's making people live</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>

406
00:22:49.931 --> 00:22:52.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't even ask if it's protecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them against diseases,</v>

407
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:53.673
<v Speaker 1>but you can't ask if it's eliciting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of physiological changes that you </v>

408
00:22:58.481 --> 00:23:02.410
<v Speaker 1>expect in calorie restriction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be a loss of body fat,</v>

409
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:05.080
<v Speaker 1>a lowering of blood glucose.</v>

410
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.050
<v Speaker 1>It's an antidiabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

411
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.980
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rendering of a sensitivity to insulin,</v>

412
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.960
<v Speaker 1>the action of insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These can all be measured and six months</v>

413
00:23:15.961 --> 00:23:16.794
<v Speaker 1>in calorie restriction and humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's roughly the same thing that it </v>

414
00:23:19.601 --> 00:23:21.100
<v Speaker 1>does in mice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

415
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:25.090
<v Speaker 1>just one footnote on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

416
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.210
<v Speaker 1>So in rodents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

417
00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.630
<v Speaker 1>what we knew is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

418
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:32.043
<v Speaker 1>some of these sirtuin activators could </v>
<v Speaker 1>activate a muscle to process glucose </v>

419
00:23:38.441 --> 00:23:40.690
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was doing that,</v>

420
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:43.610
<v Speaker 1>at least in part by activating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

421
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>the synthesis of these are organelles </v>
<v Speaker 1>and cells.</v>

422
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.880
<v Speaker 1>They're called the powerhouses of south </v>
<v Speaker 1>that make energy for sounds.</v>

423
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.330
<v Speaker 1>And by activating Mitochondria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

424
00:23:55.580 --> 00:23:56.413
<v Speaker 1>you sort of drive metabolism and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>drive the uptake of glucose from the </v>

425
00:23:59.751 --> 00:24:02.090
<v Speaker 1>blood into the muscle and the processing</v>
<v Speaker 1>of glucose.</v>

426
00:24:02.091 --> 00:24:04.040
<v Speaker 1>So it's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an antidiabetic thing.</v>

427
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.970
<v Speaker 1>And this process is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

428
00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:11.120
<v Speaker 1>can be driven by certain one survival </v>
<v Speaker 1>gene in muscle,</v>

429
00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.320
<v Speaker 1>in rodents.</v>

430
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was done first with resveratrol,</v>

431
00:24:15.771 --> 00:24:18.770
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out calorie restriction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>rodents does the same thing.</v>

432
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You activate the synthesis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mitochondria in muscle.</v>

433
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:23.443
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes them more metabolically </v>

434
00:24:25.191 --> 00:24:27.860
<v Speaker 1>active and it's a good thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolically.</v>

435
00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to get back to the humans.</v>

436
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 1>What they were able to show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

437
00:24:31.731 --> 00:24:32.564
<v Speaker 1>and this trial is they took a punch </v>
<v Speaker 1>biopsies of muscle from the people that </v>

438
00:24:37.041 --> 00:24:39.920
<v Speaker 1>were on the calorie restriction diet for</v>
<v Speaker 1>six months.</v>

439
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:40.783
<v Speaker 1>And what they found in their muscles was</v>
<v Speaker 1>an increase in Mitochondria and an </v>

440
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 1>increase in the levels of the SAR t one </v>
<v Speaker 1>protein.</v>

441
00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.110
<v Speaker 1>The protein was actually increased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

442
00:24:51.111 --> 00:24:53.240
<v Speaker 1>and the muscle in response to calorie </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction.</v>

443
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:56.930
<v Speaker 1>So that says that the congruence </v>
<v Speaker 1>between,</v>

444
00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.003
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

445
00:24:58.010 --> 00:25:00.580
<v Speaker 1>mice and humans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a,</v>

446
00:25:00.581 --> 00:25:03.650
<v Speaker 1>a quite profound with regard to calorie </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction.</v>

447
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:04.543
<v Speaker 1>So we can't say any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no direct evidence in humans </v>

448
00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 1>about diseases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly not about lifespan,</v>

449
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.190
<v Speaker 1>but at least basic physiology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

450
00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.173
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like it might be similar in </v>

451
00:25:16.011 --> 00:25:18.710
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that might not make a good prediction</v>

452
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.120
<v Speaker 1>about the effects of calorie </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction,</v>

453
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.960
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to practice calorie </v>
<v Speaker 1>restriction because it's,</v>

454
00:25:25.961 --> 00:25:26.794
<v Speaker 1>it's so unpleasant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what everybody would like as a </v>

455
00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:30.253
<v Speaker 1>mimetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a drug that would elicit at least some </v>

456
00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:34.880
<v Speaker 1>of the benefits of calorie restriction.</v>

457
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

458
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking would be one,</v>

459
00:25:43.790 --> 00:25:46.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating to caloric excess.</v>

460
00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

461
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:48.530
<v Speaker 1>Would be another.</v>

462
00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:50.893
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

463
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Being Sedentary.</v>

464
00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:53.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

465
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving around,</v>

466
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.680
<v Speaker 1>not exercising would be a third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't talk about exercise,</v>

467
00:25:59.681 --> 00:26:04.510
<v Speaker 1>but there's ample evidence that exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>is beneficial.</v>

468
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.303
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing is what we were </v>

469
00:26:08.591 --> 00:26:11.350
<v Speaker 1>just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your attitude and mindset.</v>

470
00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.273
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

471
00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:13.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being focused on negativity would be a </v>

472
00:26:16.631 --> 00:26:19.510
<v Speaker 1>fourth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the last one,</v>

473
00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again is,</v>

474
00:26:22.001 --> 00:26:22.840
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>

475
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:23.703
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more or less than this lifestyle area </v>

476
00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:27.963
<v Speaker 1>would be stress level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that level of stress that you maintain </v>

477
00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:35.310
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I believe in it.</v>

478
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:37.090
<v Speaker 1>Others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

479
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.313
<v Speaker 1>believe in something called hormesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what horn me this means is that a </v>

480
00:26:45.661 --> 00:26:49.550
<v Speaker 1>lot of stress is a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

481
00:26:49.551 --> 00:26:50.384
<v Speaker 1>stress is also a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the optimum is something in the </v>

482
00:26:55.231 --> 00:26:59.400
<v Speaker 1>middle so that you're engaged on a daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

483
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.880
<v Speaker 1>You're revved up your functioning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

484
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.560
<v Speaker 1>But you feel as though you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

485
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think finding that balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that horn he says,</v>

486
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:09.593
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

487
00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:10.463
<v Speaker 1>is probably very important in </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining mental health and physical </v>

488
00:27:14.401 --> 00:27:16.110
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be my,</v>

489
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:21.180
<v Speaker 1>my big five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

490
00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

491
00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.990
<v Speaker 1>smoking would be one.</v>

492
00:27:26.010 --> 00:27:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

493
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating to caloric excess.</v>

494
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:30.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

495
00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Would be another,</v>

496
00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:33.723
<v Speaker 2>mmm.</v>

497
00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Being Sedentary.</v>

498
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

499
00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not moving around,</v>

500
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.470
<v Speaker 1>not exercising would be a third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't talk about exercise,</v>

501
00:27:42.471 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 1>but there's ample evidence that exercise</v>
<v Speaker 1>is beneficial.</v>

502
00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:49.143
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

503
00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:52.300
<v Speaker 1>I think the other thing is what we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just talking about,</v>

504
00:27:52.301 --> 00:27:54.610
<v Speaker 1>your attitude and mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

505
00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

506
00:27:56.170 --> 00:28:00.010
<v Speaker 1>being focused on negativity would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth.</v>

507
00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:03.280
<v Speaker 1>And I think the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

508
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:05.050
<v Speaker 1>which again is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

509
00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.100
<v Speaker 1>would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

510
00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:11.460
<v Speaker 1>more or less than this lifestyle area </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be stress level,</v>

511
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.970
<v Speaker 1>that level of stress that you maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day basis.</v>

512
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.120
<v Speaker 1>So I believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others,</v>

513
00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.340
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe in something called hormesis and</v>

514
00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:29.791
<v Speaker 1>what harm me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this means is that a lot of stress is</v>

515
00:28:29.891 --> 00:28:32.350
<v Speaker 1>a bad thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

516
00:28:32.351 --> 00:28:33.184
<v Speaker 1>stress is also a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the optimum is something in the </v>

517
00:28:38.051 --> 00:28:42.220
<v Speaker 1>middle so that you're engaged on a daily</v>
<v Speaker 1>basis.</v>

518
00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.700
<v Speaker 1>You're revved up your functioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

519
00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:47.380
<v Speaker 1>But you feel as though you're in </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

520
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:51.040
<v Speaker 1>And I think finding that balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that warm he says,</v>

521
00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.383
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

522
00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:55.810
<v Speaker 1>is probably very important in </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintaining,</v>

523
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental health and physical health.</v>

524
00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.890
<v Speaker 1>So that would be my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my big five.</v>

525
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that at least for the aging </v>
<v Speaker 1>field,</v>

526
00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

527
00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:13.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment I would say that I've had</v>

528
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.710
<v Speaker 1>is that aging is fundamental to so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

529
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:25.710
<v Speaker 1>Yet I really think it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's underfunded in terms of,</v>

530
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an approach to treating these diseases.</v>

531
00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

532
00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.690
<v Speaker 1>to give you an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the past 10 to 20 years has been</v>

533
00:29:33.691 --> 00:29:34.524
<v Speaker 1>an amazing time in the field of aging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fraction of the NIH budget that </v>

534
00:29:41.651 --> 00:29:46.180
<v Speaker 1>goes to research on aging hasn't changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>over that period.</v>

535
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.950
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

536
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 1>to me that's disappointing because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think that,</v>

537
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.770
<v Speaker 1>that this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a one,</v>

538
00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:57.160
<v Speaker 1>a leverage point to really improve human</v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

539
00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure anything is overfunded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be perfectly honest.</v>

540
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

541
00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

542
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads most major areas,</v>

543
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:11.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of research,</v>

544
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I know of are meritorious.</v>

545
00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

546
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you review grants,</v>

547
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually,</v>

548
00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:20.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of grants you see that are </v>

549
00:30:22.271 --> 00:30:26.890
<v Speaker 1>worthy of funding far exceeds the number</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually get funded.</v>

550
00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.340
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

551
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.173
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying I realize it's a </v>

552
00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.150
<v Speaker 1>ultimately a zero sum game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

553
00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:35.013
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do think that aging in particular </v>

554
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 1>probably,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

555
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:43.310
<v Speaker 1>is a little bit underfunded now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the US has always been,</v>

556
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:49.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best country in terms of encouraging</v>

557
00:30:49.931 --> 00:30:51.490
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

558
00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:51.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

559
00:30:51.930 --> 00:30:52.763
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rise of the NIH and the granting </v>

560
00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

561
00:30:56.530 --> 00:31:00.100
<v Speaker 1>after a world war two to now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

562
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:04.150
<v Speaker 1>as is a really good example of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know when I was a young scientist,</v>

563
00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:05.913
<v Speaker 1>people would apply for grants and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't so hard to get the fraction </v>

565
00:31:10.421 --> 00:31:13.810
<v Speaker 1>funded maybe was 25%,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

566
00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.470
<v Speaker 1>And so that you could propose things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that were a little bit,</v>

567
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.413
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the box and have a chance of </v>

568
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:24.970
<v Speaker 1>getting funded to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which encourages innovation.</v>

569
00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:28.120
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now once things become,</v>

570
00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:33.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tight and instead of 25%,</v>

571
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:37.120
<v Speaker 1>you have 10% of grants funded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I think,</v>

572
00:31:37.121 --> 00:31:37.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any,</v>

573
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:42.250
<v Speaker 1>any grant that seems the least bit risky</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not going to be funded.</v>

574
00:31:42.790 --> 00:31:43.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

575
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:46.000
<v Speaker 1>you tend to encourage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

576
00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.190
<v Speaker 1>sort of precise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

577
00:31:48.670 --> 00:31:50.220
<v Speaker 1>calculated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

578
00:31:50.290 --> 00:31:52.330
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

579
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:53.253
<v Speaker 1>at the expense of creative science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So historically this country has been </v>

580
00:31:56.111 --> 00:31:56.944
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm a little concerned now that </v>

581
00:31:59.771 --> 00:32:02.800
<v Speaker 1>that might be a trailing off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I can't,</v>

582
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:03.993
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

583
00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.000
<v Speaker 1>offhand tell you that it's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any other place.</v>

584
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:13.330
<v Speaker 1>I think one hero I would mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

585
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:17.410
<v Speaker 1>has Galileo and the re and recent for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

586
00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:20.410
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think least to my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

587
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:25.470
<v Speaker 1>he's the greatest scientist is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we do science now is to actually</v>

588
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:32.800
<v Speaker 1>have ideas that we can test with </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

589
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:36.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the scientific methods.</v>

590
00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:41.390
<v Speaker 1>So critical to making more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

591
00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.490
<v Speaker 1>And I think in earlier civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Greeks,</v>

592
00:32:46.491 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 1>the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest minds,</v>

593
00:32:48.021 --> 00:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

594
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.160
<v Speaker 1>they just sort of intuited things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

595
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:57.170
<v Speaker 1>here's the way things must be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

596
00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.513
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a recipe for making a lot of </v>

597
00:33:01.161 --> 00:33:06.161
<v Speaker 1>mistakes and for having a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a false impression of the world.</v>

598
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.530
<v Speaker 1>And we go away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh dead was to say,</v>

599
00:33:09.531 --> 00:33:11.120
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have an idea.</v>

600
00:33:11.121 --> 00:33:15.920
<v Speaker 1>But I think the way to go is to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments and uh,</v>

601
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.410
<v Speaker 1>to test the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I think is,</v>

602
00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 1>is the bedrock upon which a modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>science has built.</v>

603
00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:25.843
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

604
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.440
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

605
00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.230
<v Speaker 1>he took a lot of heat for what he did in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his lifetime,</v>

606
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:33.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Catholic Church and uh,</v>

607
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and he was operating under a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme circumstances.</v>

608
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And given those circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he performed pretty darn well.</v>

609
00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.210
<v Speaker 1>I think one dilemma you always have is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

610
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:54.303
<v Speaker 1>our profession really depends on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to publish our work in peer </v>

611
00:33:59.401 --> 00:34:01.920
<v Speaker 1>review journals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what gets published,</v>

612
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.780
<v Speaker 1>it's really been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

613
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.840
<v Speaker 1>gone over with a fine tooth comb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we review each other's papers and</v>

614
00:34:11.490 --> 00:34:15.810
<v Speaker 1>you have to decide when you have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict of interest or not.</v>

615
00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:19.290
<v Speaker 1>And if someone's work is too close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>yours,</v>

616
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:20.333
<v Speaker 1>if they're a competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to stay away from it </v>

617
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.930
<v Speaker 1>because there's an obvious conflict of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

618
00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:27.330
<v Speaker 1>a little bit less obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

619
00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:28.660
<v Speaker 1>if you have people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

620
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:30.553
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

621
00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:32.880
<v Speaker 1>the people whose papers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

622
00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:38.130
<v Speaker 1>who wrote the papers are from your lab,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're former postdocs or students.</v>

623
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that's also a conflict of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>

624
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

625
00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:43.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

626
00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are gray areas work that's sort of</v>

627
00:34:48.061 --> 00:34:49.440
<v Speaker 1>close to your work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

628
00:34:49.441 --> 00:34:50.274
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do you draw the line of when it's </v>

629
00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:56.070
<v Speaker 1>okay to review someone else's work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had a paper or a grant,</v>

630
00:34:56.670 --> 00:34:58.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when is it not?</v>

631
00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.460
<v Speaker 1>And when it's self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

632
00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.370
<v Speaker 1>creeping in and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

633
00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very important that the </v>

634
00:35:08.101 --> 00:35:10.080
<v Speaker 1>peer review process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

635
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.200
<v Speaker 1>is this the best thing we have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

636
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:16.560
<v Speaker 1>that it be as pure as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to be perfect,</v>

637
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's worth thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

638
00:35:20.370 --> 00:35:21.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it poses,</v>

639
00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:24.360
<v Speaker 1>it poses dilemmas on a regular basis.</v>
