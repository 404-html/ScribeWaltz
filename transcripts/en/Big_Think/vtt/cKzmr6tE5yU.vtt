00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>We are seeing now climate impacts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are tremendously costly in tremendously</v>

2
00:00:05.331 --> 00:00:09.020
<v Speaker 1>challenging in EPA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His role is to try to make turn that</v>

3
00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:12.500
<v Speaker 1>challenge into a positive message moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward,</v>

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.290
<v Speaker 1>give communities the tools they need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt,</v>

5
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize that the time for action is</v>

6
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in many ways the the problem that we</v>

7
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 1>had in the past was twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People didn't see the impacts as as,</v>

8
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.760
<v Speaker 1>as much as they're seeing them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling them today.</v>

9
00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's happening.</v>

10
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were predicting things that</v>

11
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>might happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's taken so long to take action.</v>

12
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>Those predictions are already here and</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly we never predicted the kind of</v>

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:46.271
<v Speaker 1>impacts that we are seeing today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate is always portrayed on newscasts</v>

14
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>as being some kind of big debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 1>the big debate among the scientists is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that 97 percent of them know it's</v>

16
00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>happening and I really worried about it.</v>

17
00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Three percent are skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a balance.</v>

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.600
<v Speaker 1>That's an overwhelming majority in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to drive the decision,</v>

19
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>especially in a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how we work.</v>

20
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>We're working really hard with faith</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders in this country because many of</v>

21
00:01:12.861 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 1>the people listened to their faith.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lead is for direction in the faith.</v>

22
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:21.461
<v Speaker 1>Leaders are extremely concerned that</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change is an issue which most</v>

23
00:01:21.711 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>importantly more significantly impacts</v>
<v Speaker 1>low income and minority communities.</v>

24
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.070
<v Speaker 1>The least of these are going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most impacted in a changing climate,</v>

25
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 1>so we are moving with with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecumenical,</v>

26
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>a constituency in the faith community to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring this message to their constituents</v>

27
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's extremely important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize your own limitations about</v>

28
00:01:45.261 --> 00:01:48.140
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you're good at talking to and who's</v>

29
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>going to believe you and who the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to influence listened to</v>

30
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>because we can talk all we want about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the science at EPA,</v>

31
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>but you need to put that into people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes and ears in a way that they're</v>

32
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:03.770
<v Speaker 1>going to listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absorb,</v>

33
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>and know they can be part of the.</v>

34
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>The solutions moving forward that gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>them off the diamond builds a</v>

35
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:15.911
<v Speaker 1>constituencies you need to succeed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is really as big as this.</v>

36
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>The challenge of climate change is</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous for us,</v>

37
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 1>and so you need to attack that from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>different angles and make sure to get</v>

38
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>everybody engaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to fight the climate</v>

39
00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 1>deniers now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I think we need.</v>

40
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>The rallying cry needs to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What actions do we take that are going</v>

41
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 1>to address climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both from,</v>

42
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to mitigate and make sure that</v>

43
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:44.060
<v Speaker 1>we're reducing those impacts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also let's do it in a way that grows</v>

44
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.780
<v Speaker 1>a low carbon economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's make the United States flourish</v>

45
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>because we stood up to this problem and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we took action.</v>
