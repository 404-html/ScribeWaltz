1
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Feeling which are socially isolated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's related to being physically</v>

2
00:00:08.241 --> 00:00:11.300
<v Speaker 1>isolated from other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the same thing.</v>

3
00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>One can be lonely in a marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lonely in a family,</v>

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>they can be lonely in a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we found it isn't the number of</v>

5
00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>contacts or the frequency of interaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other people.</v>

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It's the quality of those interactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Freshmen who have gone to college find</v>

7
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:28.430
<v Speaker 1>themselves among many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other people,</v>

8
00:00:28.431 --> 00:00:31.380
<v Speaker 1>lots of social activities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to mixers and they look out.</v>

9
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Everyone else is talking with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they're sitting there all</v>

10
00:00:35.181 --> 00:00:38.780
<v Speaker 1>alone in their head and so that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>can make their feeling of isolation</v>

11
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>greater for that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So being around other people,</v>

12
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>that's not what makes people less</v>
<v Speaker 1>lonely.</v>

13
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.500
<v Speaker 1>It's feeling connected.</v>

14
00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Tell other people that makes them feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>less lonely.</v>

15
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 2>Traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>loneliness and depression,</v>

16
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.370
<v Speaker 1>loneliness and anxiety with treated as</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar constructs.</v>

17
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>So much so that one of the common</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures of depression that used in</v>

18
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.410
<v Speaker 1>epidemiology has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As one of the questions,</v>

19
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 1>do you feel lonely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

20
00:01:08.301 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>our own researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Trump,</v>

21
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 1>others have looked at whether loneliness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and depression to the same thing.</v>

22
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:16.010
<v Speaker 1>And we find them to be separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>contracts,</v>

23
00:01:16.011 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>they're separate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mental states are longitudinal research</v>

24
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>and our experimental research has shown</v>
<v Speaker 1>that loneliness leads to increased</v>

25
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>depressive symptomatology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if no matter how depressed you are</v>

26
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're feeling lonely today,</v>

27
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>you will be more depressed a year from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

28
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.090
<v Speaker 1>above and beyond what your level of</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression today would predict because</v>

29
00:01:38.091 --> 00:01:41.180
<v Speaker 1>of the loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also find that depression leads you</v>

30
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>to withdrawal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at difference in depression and</v>

31
00:01:43.281 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 1>loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loneliness makes you want to reach out</v>

32
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:48.560
<v Speaker 1>and contact other people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a part of that group,</v>

33
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>be a part of that relationship.</v>

34
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Depression is associated with depressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>an effect,</v>

35
00:01:53.361 --> 00:01:56.390
<v Speaker 1>but also with lethargy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of this withdrawal from others,</v>

36
00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and indeed with depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find over time people do withdraw</v>

37
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>from others and that withdrawal and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>increased stress associated with that</v>

38
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>leads them to field lonelier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have this pernicious feedback</v>

39
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>loop below maynard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are,</v>

40
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the more depressed they become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more depressed they are,</v>

41
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:15.740
<v Speaker 1>the more they withdraw and the lonelier</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become.</v>

42
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.180
<v Speaker 1>If you look at those two effects of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of loneliness and depression is</v>

43
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:22.700
<v Speaker 1>stronger than the effect of depression</v>
<v Speaker 1>on loaning us.</v>

44
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 1>People can be depressed for other</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons and feeling lonely,</v>

45
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but many people who go in to seek</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment for depression at the root of</v>

46
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:34.370
<v Speaker 1>the problem is their feeling of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnection and isolation and unless</v>

47
00:02:34.371 --> 00:02:37.850
<v Speaker 1>that's treated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the depression or any attempt to fix</v>

48
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:40.490
<v Speaker 1>that is really just kind of a transient</v>
<v Speaker 1>bandaid.</v>

49
00:02:40.491 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not getting at the root problem.</v>

50
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 2>The measurements of loneliness is</v>

51
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.970
<v Speaker 1>somewhat not obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob People know that they feel isolated,</v>

52
00:02:52.971 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>they feel disconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have others on whom they can</v>

53
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>rely or talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's mostly they don't have a</v>

54
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 1>confidant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have anyone who affirms who</v>

55
00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of it.</v>

56
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask people,</v>

57
00:03:04.811 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>do they feel lonely?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There tends to be this stigma associated</v>

58
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>with loneliness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our research has suggested it's</v>

59
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>an inappropriate stigma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's nevertheless the stigma</v>

60
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:16.650
<v Speaker 1>associated with the loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people underreport.</v>

61
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>If you ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you feel lonely?</v>

62
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>They under report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you ask them,</v>

63
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>are there others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son whom they can rely to,</v>

64
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.710
<v Speaker 1>whom they can relate to and whom they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can confide a.</v>

65
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>that's when you start to see people</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitting this feeling of isolation.</v>

66
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.710
<v Speaker 1>There's also this sense in which they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a collective identity,</v>

67
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>so immediately after nine slash 11 when</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all survived that tragedy,</v>

68
00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>it made being an American salient.</v>

69
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a social identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you notice in this country,</v>

70
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>journalists were writing about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>harmony,</v>

71
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>the goodwill that existed in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a step up of what had been felt</v>

72
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.650
<v Speaker 1>weak before nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of being connected and so</v>

73
00:03:57.651 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the individual is also absent that</v>

74
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 1>social identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it may be in the form of feeling</v>

75
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>like you're an American after a tragedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it might be a Chicago cubs are New</v>

76
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>York Yankees Fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These kinds of identities are part of</v>

77
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>how we are connected to other other</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and other groups and loamy</v>

78
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>individuals tend to lock those as well.</v>

79
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.820
<v Speaker 1>There are several secrets to overcoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>or avoiding moments I.</v>

80
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I like to use the analog of of hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A loneliness has evolved because it has</v>

81
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>very adaptive purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are fundamentally social species,</v>

82
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>but we need some signal when that</v>
<v Speaker 1>important need isn't being met.</v>

83
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Very much like hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need a reasonable level of blood</v>

84
00:04:43.121 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 1>sugar or else we don't have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>metabolic resources,</v>

85
00:04:45.941 --> 00:04:49.870
<v Speaker 1>the energy to pursue foraging and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

86
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we start to have lower blood sugar</v>

87
00:04:53.321 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we become hungry,</v>

88
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a signal that we should find</v>

89
00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:02.521
<v Speaker 1>food and eat and refuel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we ignore that hunger signal.</v>

90
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>If we think that somehow that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stigmatizing,</v>

91
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 1>and so we simply persisted not pursuing</v>
<v Speaker 1>any food.</v>

92
00:05:10.541 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And ignoring that signal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can become so depleted of energy that</v>

93
00:05:14.951 --> 00:05:19.600
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer able to seek that food</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it can become chronic and deadly.</v>

94
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>Loneliness is very much like that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of sustaining us with calories,</v>

95
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>it seemed sustains us with connections</v>
<v Speaker 1>in evolutionary times.</v>

96
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.820
<v Speaker 1>We were not able to fend off large wild</v>
<v Speaker 1>beasts very well as individuals with the</v>

97
00:05:33.821 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 1>stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nor are we able to take care of our</v>

98
00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:41.290
<v Speaker 1>offspring who had the longest period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>abject dependency of any species.</v>

99
00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.470
<v Speaker 1>If we were simply solitary animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are able to achieve a reproduction</v>

100
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.230
<v Speaker 1>survival and our offspring survive long</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough so that they to reproduce a</v>

101
00:05:52.661 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>because we acted as a group as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective.</v>

102
00:05:56.021 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>So find yourself ostracized or separated</v>
<v Speaker 1>from that group is a threatening</v>

103
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.130
<v Speaker 1>dangerous circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recognizing that you also can understand</v>

104
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>how the feeling of loneliness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pain of loneliness,</v>

105
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>the threat that's associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>loneliness is a signal very much like</v>

106
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.140
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's there to cue the need to</v>

107
00:06:15.141 --> 00:06:18.980
<v Speaker 1>reconnect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect that part of our,</v>

108
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.800
<v Speaker 1>our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

109
00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>and if we respond to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that cute?</v>

110
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 1>Then it can be very healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't respond to that queue,</v>

111
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>then you can fall into the grips of</v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic loneliness.</v>

112
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>And that has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I suggested,</v>

113
00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.480
<v Speaker 1>very deleterious mental psychological</v>
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>

114
00:06:35.481 --> 00:06:37.190
<v Speaker 1>but also physiological effects.</v>
