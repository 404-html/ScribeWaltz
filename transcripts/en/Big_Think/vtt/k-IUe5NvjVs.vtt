00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.070
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's growing role in Africa.</v>

2
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I personally am not a particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>either upset or surprised by this</v>

3
00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:17.381
<v Speaker 1>because realistically what's going on is</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply the increased role that China is</v>

4
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>playing in the globe at large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.450
<v Speaker 1>as you would expect a growing economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

6
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play,</v>

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's focused on resource plays.</v>

8
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:36.311
<v Speaker 1>It's focused on buying up and securing</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy sources and materials and various</v>

9
00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>things that will fuel the continued</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth of the Chinese economy.</v>

10
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's exactly what you'd expect.</v>

11
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>It certainly has some adverse</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences because since the Chinese</v>

12
00:00:47.991 --> 00:00:52.910
<v Speaker 1>don't care about various kinds of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights issues and they don't care about</v>

13
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>political freedoms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're more than happy to deal with</v>

14
00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:58.580
<v Speaker 1>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're more than happy to overlook all</v>

15
00:00:58.581 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>sorts of trouble if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there are particular immediate needs</v>

16
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 1>are taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what,</v>

17
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:08.420
<v Speaker 1>in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese might well find that</v>

18
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:13.421
<v Speaker 1>stability and sustainably healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>viable local communities and,</v>

19
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.850
<v Speaker 1>and policies are in their best interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
