1
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>The best ones I go to are divided</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the ones that I will go to once</v>

2
00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>a month forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I just,</v>

3
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>I it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.423
<v Speaker 1>I just</v>

5
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 2>second there are all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

6
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 2>I always go back for something that's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>part.</v>

7
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Then I check out almost every</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant new restaurant.</v>

8
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 2>I live in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in New York,</v>

9
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:34.480
<v Speaker 2>but wherever I am,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always interested in what's new,</v>

10
00:00:34.481 --> 00:00:37.450
<v Speaker 2>what young chefs are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>

11
00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 2>And I'll go there once or twice</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes I get obsessed with a new</v>

12
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and I'll go every other day</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a month.</v>

13
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's sort of like the new restaurant</v>

14
00:00:46.781 --> 00:00:51.781
<v Speaker 2>piece and then there are major</v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants that when I'm really almost</v>

15
00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:58.681
<v Speaker 2>in a Rut when it comes to creating new</v>
<v Speaker 2>recipes or thinking about food I go to</v>

16
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:04.610
<v Speaker 2>because they're always inspirational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're always amazing and they,</v>

17
00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 2>they always give me something and sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of restore my faith in cooking and</v>

18
00:01:09.551 --> 00:01:11.710
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sort of the temples that are</v>

19
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.600
<v Speaker 2>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a couple from each</v>

20
00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:14.434
<v Speaker 2>category.</v>

21
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 2>the restaurants that I go to once a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month because they just feel great.</v>

23
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 2>A bow is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are the oyster bar grand central.</v>

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.833
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

25
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 2>well let's just say those are two good</v>
<v Speaker 2>examples.</v>

27
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 2>And I would put bond street actually in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that category.</v>

28
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say all three of those are</v>

29
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 2>places that are bustling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The food is really excellent quality.</v>

30
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.680
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the case of oyster bar,</v>

31
00:01:48.681 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 2>I only eat oysters there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the food,</v>

32
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 2>the food is really excellent quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.030
<v Speaker 2>and it's just a bustling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great feeling place.</v>

34
00:01:56.031 --> 00:01:57.380
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that kind category.</v>

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.760
<v Speaker 2>The new restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what's new and exciting.</v>

36
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to this place called del Anima</v>

37
00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:06.170
<v Speaker 2>the other night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was really,</v>

38
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really exciting.</v>

39
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

40
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 2>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New is always hard because it's a total</v>

42
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 2>crapshoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

43
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

44
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:21.741
<v Speaker 2>I want to see what's going on and what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and one out of 10 will be,</v>

45
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will be terrific,</v>

46
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right now for there's a kind of</v>

47
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Italian resurgence in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually.</v>

48
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 2>A morality is not that new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a restaurant that I,</v>

49
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.360
<v Speaker 2>I ate at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say,</v>

50
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

51
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:43.030
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got my credit card statement the other</v>

52
00:02:43.031 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 2>day and it was like the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only merchant on it was Miranda I</v>

53
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.120
<v Speaker 2>ate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're probably like,</v>

54
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 times a month for three months.</v>

55
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.190
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just interested.</v>

56
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 2>I thought the chef was doing certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>things I was really,</v>

57
00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 2>really interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

58
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 2>and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the high holy restaurants that I have to</v>

59
00:03:01.841 --> 00:03:04.860
<v Speaker 2>go back to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely Babo.</v>

60
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I just think Mario Batali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he can do no wrong in my book.</v>

61
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 2>He's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Babo is,</v>

62
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.270
<v Speaker 2>You can't get a reservation there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so difficult to get a reservation,</v>

64
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you would think that it's kind of</v>

65
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:19.361
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

66
00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:21.940
<v Speaker 2>so they get into a routine and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have to be that great because.</v>

67
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every single time you go there,</v>

68
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 2>you have something that you haven't had</v>
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>

69
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.210
<v Speaker 2>That's totally seasonal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brilliant.</v>

70
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 2>It feels like it's existed forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except you've never actually had that</v>

71
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 2>dish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's genius.</v>

72
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>And George,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel the same way it was on.</v>

73
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:41.971
<v Speaker 2>George is interesting to me because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>service there is so pristine that you,</v>

74
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a beauty super hold.</v>

75
00:03:46.651 --> 00:03:51.651
<v Speaker 2>It's a beauty to feel</v>
<v Speaker 2>what modern perfect service can be like.</v>

76
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the food is always</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting,</v>

77
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 2>always exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

78
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always has flavors that are lovely</v>

79
00:04:01.511 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 2>and wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there are those three</v>

80
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:07.210
<v Speaker 2>categories you can tell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I absolutely love eating at restaurants.</v>

81
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.690
<v Speaker 2>Then of course there is ethnic food</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I eat a lot of and I mainly depend</v>

82
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 2>on cab drivers for my recommendations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a,</v>

83
00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 2>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 2>New York is just like a paradise for</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
