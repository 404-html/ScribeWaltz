00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Several years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Health Organization declared</v>

2
00:00:06.761 --> 00:00:11.620
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't cost effective to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get treatment for drug resistant</v>

3
00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:14.950
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was an organization called</v>

4
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>partners in health that said simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>refused six up this claim.</v>

5
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to do whatever it takes to</v>

6
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>help these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they came up with a program for</v>

7
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:30.181
<v Speaker 1>treating drug resistant tuberculosis in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the world's most conflict ridden</v>

8
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>poorest places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they succeeded in doing it.</v>

9
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>They had very good treatment outcomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they thought creatively about how to</v>

10
00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>come up with treatment programs that</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked,</v>

11
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>funding for drug resistant TB increased</v>

12
00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>spectacularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now many people around the world</v>

13
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.430
<v Speaker 1>have treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>

14
00:00:48.431 --> 00:00:52.930
<v Speaker 1>I think what they did is they have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtue which requires three things.</v>

15
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.430
<v Speaker 1>First that we commit to fulfilling human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights.</v>

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we think creatively or imagine ways</v>

17
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally that we act to do so.</v>

18
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain the virtue of creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve a little bit more and hopefully</v>

19
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.960
<v Speaker 1>you'll see why I think it's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>

20
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 1>So first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have the virtue,</v>

21
00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.460
<v Speaker 1>one has to question evidence against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of fulfilling human rights.</v>

22
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.410
<v Speaker 1>We can do this in many ways so we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>question the source reliability or</v>

23
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 1>implications of that evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's possible,</v>

24
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to acquiesce to quickly in the face of</v>

25
00:01:30.911 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 1>evidence that it's impossible to help</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or to be so pigheaded that we</v>

26
00:01:35.681 --> 00:01:37.810
<v Speaker 1>refuse to accept the constraints so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>give it.</v>

27
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.540
<v Speaker 1>The second thing that we need to do is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think consider all of the options on the</v>

28
00:01:43.541 --> 00:01:47.740
<v Speaker 1>table and then use our imagination to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come up with new options.</v>

29
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should act to fulfill human rights</v>

30
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:57.610
<v Speaker 1>and this requires a measure of grit will</v>
<v Speaker 1>or resoluteness.</v>

31
00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.680
<v Speaker 1>We can't be inflexible and persists even</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it is actually impossible to</v>

32
00:02:02.681 --> 00:02:05.020
<v Speaker 1>fulfill rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time we shouldn't be</v>

33
00:02:05.021 --> 00:02:10.021
<v Speaker 1>complacent about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since change is difficult,</v>

34
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>people who don't think that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible or desirable to fulfill human</v>

35
00:02:16.211 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>rights probably won't try hard to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hope is important for the virtue of</v>

36
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>creative resolve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hope is simply believing something that</v>

37
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 1>one desires as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not certain.</v>

38
00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we lack a kind of hope,</v>

39
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>I think we should have the virtue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative resolve as long as there is not</v>

40
00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>conclusive evidence that fulfilling</v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights is impossible.</v>

41
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So the kind of hope we need is a radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope in the face of uncertainty.</v>

42
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.910
<v Speaker 1>We must persist and exercise our moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginations to help people meet their</v>

43
00:02:48.911 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>basic needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the reason we should have creative</v>

44
00:02:52.691 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 1>resolve is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground for the human rights is</v>

45
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>protecting everybody's ability to live a</v>
<v Speaker 1>human life.</v>

46
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's really important that we do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

47
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>So we should try hard.</v>

48
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>I think the imperative to try hard is</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly compelling given that</v>

49
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of psychological evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't try hard enough.</v>

50
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>They tend to search to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

51
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>not far enough for solutions to</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

52
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>And many people seem to have a narrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>view of possibility and feasibility.</v>

53
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Assuming tight timeframes and financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>constraints when we imagine ourselves</v>

54
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>succeeding and tasks were often more</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely to do so.</v>

55
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps because our imagination as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of agency and lets us set plans</v>

56
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:42.901
<v Speaker 1>for the future and act to achieve them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crux of my disagreement with critics</v>

57
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>of the human right to health who think</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to ration and that the human</v>

58
00:03:48.491 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>right has to tell us how to do that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

59
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's what the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights health has to do,</v>

60
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>or even that it should rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it does something much more</v>

61
00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>important for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it inspires us to do our best to</v>

62
00:04:03.581 --> 00:04:08.581
<v Speaker 1>help everyone meet their basic needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>But if we do have to ration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what I think.</v>

64
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 1>I think creative resolve can help us do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

65
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it can help us find better ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>of helping more people.</v>

66
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.370
<v Speaker 1>We can't simply build hospitals in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city rather than also in the countryside</v>

67
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>because it's most cost effective to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

68
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has a human right to health</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we think creatively enough about</v>

69
00:04:31.401 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 1>how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may be able to help everybody.</v>

70
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's two sides to this virtue.</v>

71
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>On the one side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should try very hard to help people</v>

72
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.540
<v Speaker 1>fulfill their human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other side,</v>

73
00:04:46.541 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>we don't have to try when it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible or impermissible to do that,</v>

74
00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to stress and I have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>stressing the positive or commitment</v>

75
00:04:55.751 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>side of the virtue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>

76
00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>millions of people around the world are</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffering and dying every year from</v>

77
00:05:02.321 --> 00:05:06.340
<v Speaker 1>poverty related causes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not as if there's millions of</v>

78
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.690
<v Speaker 1>people trying to help them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe we need to try harder,</v>

79
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>try harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try harder.</v>

80
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to find both the</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and the political will to do</v>

81
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:25.111
<v Speaker 1>this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and like Martin Luther King,</v>

82
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>we should refuse to believe that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bank of justice.</v>
