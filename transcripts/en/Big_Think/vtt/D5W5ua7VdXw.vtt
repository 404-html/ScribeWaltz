1
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 1>My opinion on the legalization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is complicated because when we</v>

2
00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>think about a society in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think about these things,</v>

3
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:20.240
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every society has.</v>

4
00:00:20.241 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>They're intoxicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have alcohol,</v>

5
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:27.080
<v Speaker 1>that's our primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we also have to mackle and we have</v>

6
00:00:27.081 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>caffeine which is not as intoxicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question becomes,</v>

7
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:36.701
<v Speaker 1>should we make another intoxicant legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we know all the problems that we</v>

8
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:40.040
<v Speaker 1>have with those with alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco,</v>

9
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>and caffeine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know the problems that we may have,</v>

10
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>so that means if you have marijuana to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be more widely available,</v>

11
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>you can also expect to maybe have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>more problems.</v>

12
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>Some of those similar types of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

13
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.210
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in New York City for example,</v>

14
00:00:56.211 --> 00:01:01.211
<v Speaker 1>we're arresting hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people every year for marijuana and they</v>

15
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>have they as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a record or they have some</v>

16
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:11.831
<v Speaker 1>sort of blemish and that might retard</v>
<v Speaker 1>their ability to make a contribution.</v>

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.880
<v Speaker 1>So we are also having some consequences</v>
<v Speaker 1>from our current legal status of the</v>

18
00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:24.320
<v Speaker 1>drug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the society has to balance what is</v>

19
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:29.321
<v Speaker 1>more important to the society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should do so with their eyes</v>

20
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will have problems either way,</v>

21
00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but the point becomes which problems are</v>
<v Speaker 1>we willing to tolerate as a society on</v>

22
00:01:41.451 --> 00:01:43.880
<v Speaker 1>the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that's the legalization issue that</v>

23
00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.070
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's more availability.</v>

24
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we think about medical marijuana,</v>

25
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institute on medicine,</v>

26
00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did a report,</v>

27
00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>still tried to study this issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>comprehensively and suggested that we</v>

28
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>should probably continue to investigate</v>
<v Speaker 1>therapeutic potential,</v>

29
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.890
<v Speaker 1>the therapeutic potential of marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's clearly support that position</v>

30
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>that we certainly need to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are suffering and we have</v>

31
00:02:14.241 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>potential medications that will help</v>
<v Speaker 1>relieve their suffering,</v>

32
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>absolutely we should go full forth with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that and we should do it in a</v>

33
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>responsible way in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.780
<v Speaker 1>in a similar way in which we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.470
<v Speaker 1>in which we use drugs like morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially heroin.</v>

36
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.743
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

37
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.350
<v Speaker 1>we do that responsibly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

38
00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.460
<v Speaker 1>and we certainly do it in a restricted</v>
<v Speaker 1>and controlled manner.</v>

39
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>And we should probably do the same with</v>
<v Speaker 1>marijuana.</v>
