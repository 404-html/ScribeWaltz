1
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Consciousness Freeville as often</v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstood because we know what they</v>

2
00:00:08.921 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>reference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult to know what by</v>

3
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we really mean by free will.</v>

4
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people will immediately feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>that freewill is related to whether the</v>

5
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>university is deterministic or</v>
<v Speaker 1>probabilistic and about physics has some</v>

6
00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>ideas about that which change every now</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then.</v>

7
00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not part of our experience and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think it makes a difference.</v>

8
00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>If the universe forces you randomly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do things or deterministically.</v>

9
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>The important thing seems to meet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Freeville you are responsible for</v>

10
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:40.410
<v Speaker 1>your actions and responsibilities is</v>
<v Speaker 1>social interface.</v>

11
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I am told that if I do x,</v>

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.360
<v Speaker 1>I go to prison and this changes my</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to whether or not to do x,</v>

13
00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously responsible for my</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision because it wasn't a spiel to my</v>

14
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>responsibility in some sense or</v>
<v Speaker 1>likewise,</v>

15
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>if I do a certain thing that it causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>harm to other people and they don't want</v>

16
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>that harm to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that influences my decision.</v>

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>This is a just course of decision making</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we,</v>

18
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>I would call,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a free vote decision.</v>

19
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.200
<v Speaker 1>We'll list the representation that my</v>
<v Speaker 1>nervous system at any level of its</v>

20
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:17.280
<v Speaker 1>functioning has raised a motive to an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intention.</v>

21
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It has committed to a particular kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal.</v>

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Let's get integrated into the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

23
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>this protocol that I experience of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself and as well,</v>

24
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>and that was what I experienced as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it will decision and this decision is</v>

25
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.210
<v Speaker 1>free and in as much as this decision can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be influenced by this course.</v>

26
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>So to me for evil is a social notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means that this interface also have</v>

27
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>social interaction of discourse of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about things,</v>

28
00:01:44.101 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 1>about this interface of knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>

29
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.360
<v Speaker 1>conceptual thought as relevant for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A decision if you a decision in which it</v>

30
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>doesn't play a role for instance because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already addicted to something and</v>

31
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>you cannot stop doing it even if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to.</v>

32
00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Then this decision I would say is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

33
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.340
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in eastern Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was communist,</v>

34
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>eastern Germany and it was a very weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology of the country,</v>

35
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>a country that believed in stories about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the world works.</v>

36
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.480
<v Speaker 1>That I as a nerd thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously not quite true.</v>

37
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I had difficulty believing the official</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories about how the world works.</v>

38
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>It was like some weird kind of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the wall came down and it</v>

39
00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:24.750
<v Speaker 1>didn't surprise me in the least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we entered a new dream,</v>

40
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>a new shared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a model of the world.</v>

41
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>It was not quite true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I realized that most people now fall</v>

42
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>for this new model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very interesting for to see if</v>

43
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>it's for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

44
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>if you look for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the u s the majority of us Americans</v>

45
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.220
<v Speaker 1>do not believe in the theory of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

46
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>Despite all the evidence to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary.</v>

47
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of people are on this</v>

48
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.040
<v Speaker 1>planet are religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though that doesn't seem to be very</v>

49
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>good evidence for a multitude of Creator</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gods and so on,</v>

50
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.050
<v Speaker 1>in my view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least.</v>

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.670
<v Speaker 1>And if it existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a creator God exists,</v>

52
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>it would be very hard for me to why this</v>
<v Speaker 1>creator,</v>

53
00:03:00.641 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>God really does care about whether I</v>
<v Speaker 1>worship it or,</v>

54
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>all these things that we attribute to</v>
<v Speaker 1>create God's fire religion.</v>

56
00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard for me in some sense to</v>

57
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:16.531
<v Speaker 1>intuitively understand why humans are</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious invite humans are ideological.</v>

58
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>But I think now over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

59
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.690
<v Speaker 1>that this is not a bug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a feature.</v>

60
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.530
<v Speaker 1>Humans are a programmable species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religions and ideologies are operating</v>

61
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:33.841
<v Speaker 1>systems for societies and they have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>so throughout most of our history and</v>

62
00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>this idea that we can build society</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on rational arguments is very,</v>

63
00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>very recent and very novel.</v>

64
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>And it's not entirely clear if it really</v>
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>

65
00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>but it's clear that we cannot really</v>
<v Speaker 1>build societies on conflicting</v>

66
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>ideologies that are at war with each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

67
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>In the past that has led to situations</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the ideology solve the problems by</v>

68
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 1>killing the unbelievers or their</v>
<v Speaker 1>religions did the same thing.</v>

69
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And we all agree this is not what you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to have.</v>

70
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>We want to have an open society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pluralistic society and nonviolent</v>

71
00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>tolerance society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still one where people work together</v>

72
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>and cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That and this ability to wake up into a</v>

73
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>shared dream in which people believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>things because their neighbors believe</v>

74
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:17.910
<v Speaker 1>them has been a very powerful feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably the reason vive,</v>

75
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>you were able to build our scale</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies.</v>

76
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 1>We have to understand that when people</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate,</v>

77
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>they're very often in what we call a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoner's dilemma,</v>

78
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:29.680
<v Speaker 1>a situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in order to achieve the greatest</v>

79
00:04:29.681 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to give up something for</v>

80
00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as in a situation where that is in</v>

81
00:04:34.331 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>some sense a bit irrational.</v>

82
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.830
<v Speaker 1>Because if everybody else is not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

83
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be worse off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for these prisoners,</v>

84
00:04:42.491 --> 00:04:43.031
<v Speaker 1>Sal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I must be,</v>

85
00:04:43.031 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>have various solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The easiest solution is to have a</v>

86
00:04:46.001 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 1>reputation system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You basically keep track of who did what</v>

87
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you make sure that only the good</v>

88
00:04:51.311 --> 00:04:52.144
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>get cookies in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is that these reputation</v>

90
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>systems do not scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have too many people in your</v>

91
00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:03.670
<v Speaker 1>tribe or your family or in your village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just lose track of who did what</v>

92
00:05:03.671 --> 00:05:05.610
<v Speaker 1>when.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you cannot really synchronize it by</v>

93
00:05:05.611 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>our talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after a couple of hundred</v>

94
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 1>individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reputation system doesn't work very</v>

95
00:05:10.661 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also doesn't really work if you are</v>

96
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>not looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if nobody is doing this surveillance,</v>

97
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.160
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you make sure that nobody is</v>

98
00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>affecting and stealing stuff from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fridge of your tribe?</v>

99
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

100
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we do?</v>

101
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.710
<v Speaker 1>We evolve the ability to be normative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ability or the need to be good and</v>

102
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 1>this need to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This need to follow internalized norms.</v>

103
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.140
<v Speaker 1>This need to serve sacred principles is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that is probably a feature</v>

104
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 1>that is ingrained into our genetic</v>
<v Speaker 1>makeup.</v>

105
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>And of course this alone would not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>good enough because goodness is like an</v>

106
00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary vector and value space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People also have a need to synchronize</v>

107
00:05:51.281 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So people will try to feel what's good</v>

108
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>in their ingroup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works by empathy is the primary mode</v>

109
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:02.300
<v Speaker 1>in which we transmit norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you dress up somebody as an</v>

110
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a priest,</v>

111
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.280
<v Speaker 1>as a professor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a pop star is a politician and this</v>

112
00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 1>person says a certain thing was</v>
<v Speaker 1>conviction and people see that,</v>

113
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>others believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they start leaving it themselves.</v>

114
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>And it's obviously very useful to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

115
00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.150
<v Speaker 1>There's almost never a situation where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's useful to have an opinion that is</v>

116
00:06:20.151 --> 00:06:25.151
<v Speaker 1>different from the opinion of your boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is the ability that we got.</v>

117
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>And it means that people perform the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same things that they have followed the</v>

118
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.780
<v Speaker 1>same rules regardless of the size of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

119
00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 1>And this makes it possible to build</v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural societies.</v>

120
00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>There's hundreds of thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals and then millions of</v>

121
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it possible that this</v>

122
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 1>agricultural society has people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>specialized on different fruits and</v>

123
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.400
<v Speaker 1>different traits and different materials</v>
<v Speaker 1>and different crafts and so on and</v>

124
00:06:51.741 --> 00:06:55.880
<v Speaker 1>produce all the multitude of tasks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools that we need to get an</v>

125
00:06:55.881 --> 00:07:00.881
<v Speaker 1>agricultural society to run and be able</v>
<v Speaker 1>to outcompete the nomadic societies.</v>

126
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And I think the reason by Homo Sapians</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the only hominid species that's left</v>

127
00:07:06.951 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>us because we out competed them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were in the same competitive niche</v>

128
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 1>and be various species that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>programmable.</v>

129
00:07:12.051 --> 00:07:14.220
<v Speaker 1>There was able to coordinate arbitrary</v>
<v Speaker 1>logical,</v>

130
00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>buff individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was very powerful.</v>

131
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It just turns out that this mode of</v>
<v Speaker 1>tribal organization is not sufficient</v>

132
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.510
<v Speaker 1>for the world that we live in now.</v>

133
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
