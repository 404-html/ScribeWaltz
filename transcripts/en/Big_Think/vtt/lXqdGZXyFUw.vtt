00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.310
<v Speaker 1>How do we thrive in a world where every</v>
<v Speaker 1>which way we turn our fear is being</v>

2
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>activated by politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the media,</v>

3
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and by the desperate events that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening around us.</v>

4
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>What is really fascinating when we look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the brain research around fear is</v>

5
00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:33.061
<v Speaker 1>that our brains proxy anything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels unfamiliar,</v>

6
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>incoherent or inaccessible as being</v>
<v Speaker 1>unsafe.</v>

7
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>So let me give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is fascinating research that shows</v>

8
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>that when people have lower levels of</v>
<v Speaker 1>self esteem and they are in a job in</v>

9
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>which they are recognized and promoted,</v>

10
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 1>that promotion can feel incoherent to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person with low self esteem.</v>

11
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>They have low self esteem and they might</v>
<v Speaker 1>be used to and expecting to be treated</v>

12
00:01:11.331 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what is fascinating is the results</v>

13
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>showing that when people are promoted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they have lower levels of self</v>

14
00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>esteem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more likely to leave their</v>

15
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fear is an incredibly,</v>

16
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.490
<v Speaker 1>incredibly powerful force in our lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our brains have fairly immature in</v>

17
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>assessing anything that feels slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>incoherent or unfamiliar as unsafe.</v>

18
00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 1>What this might mean is that if you are</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to hearing a story time and time</v>

19
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:58.661
<v Speaker 1>again from a parent or from a partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you are not good enough,</v>

20
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.700
<v Speaker 1>you are more likely to be drawn to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship because it feels familiar.</v>

21
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 1>The messaging that you are getting time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and time again is connected with what</v>

22
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:18.791
<v Speaker 1>you expect to get when we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians who are effectively</v>

23
00:02:19.581 --> 00:02:24.050
<v Speaker 1>demagogues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are inspiring fear in us,</v>

24
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 1>that fear leads to very particular and</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively predictable responses.</v>

25
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 1>When we are fearful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this idea in psychological</v>

26
00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:41.021
<v Speaker 1>research of mortality salience that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>our mortality is threatened,</v>

27
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:43.970
<v Speaker 1>when someone says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

28
00:02:43.971 --> 00:02:48.971
<v Speaker 1>this group of people is out to get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we feel that we are actively being</v>

29
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:54.971
<v Speaker 1>threatened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are more likely to stereotype.</v>

30
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>We are more likely as individuals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>become bigoted.</v>

31
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.410
<v Speaker 1>We are more likely to respond to</v>
<v Speaker 1>messages that we hear time and time</v>

32
00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:10.771
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they are against our values as</v>

33
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:16.080
<v Speaker 1>somehow making sense to us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we protect ourselves against</v>

34
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Conaman describes system one</v>

35
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:25.351
<v Speaker 1>thinking and system two thinking system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thinking is the intuitive response,</v>

36
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>the emotional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visceral us and them that can sometimes</v>

37
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:37.171
<v Speaker 1>arise out of fear system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two is the deliberate thoughtful</v>

38
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>examination of what is this person</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying?</v>

39
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it aligned with how I really want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be?</v>

40
00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Is it connected with how I really wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to raise my children?</v>

41
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>Is this a world that I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>support?</v>

42
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>When we are able to step back from our</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

43
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 1>not to pretend that it doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to see our fear for what it is fear</v>

44
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.680
<v Speaker 1>not a direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but data and an emotion.</v>

45
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>When we are able to step back from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear and able to assess the fear and</v>

46
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:27.091
<v Speaker 1>assist the messaging from the place of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our values in a more deliberate,</v>

47
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.170
<v Speaker 1>thoughtful way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are able to come to a place where we</v>

48
00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>are ultimately protect it from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>demagoguery message,</v>

49
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>from the message of fear and are able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>move ourselves forward in a way that is</v>

50
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:47.281
<v Speaker 1>aligned with how we truly want to be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a world that we truly want to live</v>

51
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:52.351
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Donald Trump first started with all</v>

52
00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>of this messaging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we used to hear things that the</v>

53
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>politicians would say and we would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

54
00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.660
<v Speaker 1>oh my goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can the person possibly say that</v>

55
00:05:01.661 --> 00:05:02.494
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>

56
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100
<v Speaker 1>But what happens over time is the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar something sounds so the more</v>

57
00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.830
<v Speaker 1>we've heard it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and time again,</v>

58
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 1>even if the story is inaccurate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the story doesn't serve us,</v>

59
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>the more we're likely to become inured</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it and immune to it.</v>

60
00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:27.840
<v Speaker 1>So what I actually think from a media</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective is when I speak to people in</v>

61
00:05:28.481 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>the media about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will often say,</v>

62
00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we simply go with the story takes us.</v>

63
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>So we'll give as much coverage to</v>
<v Speaker 1>wherever the stories at even if the</v>

64
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 1>story is one that incites hatred or</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

65
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>But I actually think that there is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

66
00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>very powerful ethical choice that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>media makes a net.</v>

67
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.770
<v Speaker 1>Because when they expose and expose and</v>
<v Speaker 1>expose and expose a story that is about</v>

68
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:04.001
<v Speaker 1>hatred and a story that is about</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence as human beings,</v>

69
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:06.950
<v Speaker 1>the more familiar we become with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>

70
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>the more insured we become to it.</v>

71
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 1>And I think we can see exactly this in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current elections,</v>

72
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.280
<v Speaker 1>that things that were said six months</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago where everyone was horrified that a</v>

73
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:26.021
<v Speaker 1>politician could possibly even prevail</v>
<v Speaker 1>on people to listen to what was being</v>

74
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:30.440
<v Speaker 1>said or not being met with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

75
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:35.630
<v Speaker 1>there we go again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We somehow have become inured to the</v>

76
00:06:35.631 --> 00:06:40.631
<v Speaker 1>messaging because of the familiarity</v>
<v Speaker 1>with which we are hearing it and I think</v>

77
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:46.901
<v Speaker 1>it's really important for us as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>society and for us as voters to</v>

78
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>recognize that a familiar story is not</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily a truthful story.</v>

79
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.920
<v Speaker 1>A familiar story might sound comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our brains might proxy that story</v>

80
00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>for meaning safe and therefore right and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore comfortable.</v>

81
00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>But that story doesn't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflect us or what we value.</v>

82
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>And it's really important to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>step out from the safety of what might</v>

83
00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:23.321
<v Speaker 1>at this point feel familiar and really</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize the words for what they are.</v>

84
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.520
<v Speaker 1>They are words that are inciting hatred</v>
<v Speaker 1>and division and stereotyping in us as a</v>

85
00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for many of us,</v>

86
00:07:36.741 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 1>that's not the society in which we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to live.</v>

87
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:45.220
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's a moral impetus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>us to be able to step back from the</v>

88
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:50.150
<v Speaker 1>story and step forward with our values.</v>
