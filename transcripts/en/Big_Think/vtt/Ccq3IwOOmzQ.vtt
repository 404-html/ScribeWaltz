<v Speaker 1>companies do more with less details at</v>

4
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm Alice Rivlin and I'm a senior fellow</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Brookings Institution.</v>

5
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I think we're in a positive the</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation cycle,</v>

6
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 2>which is definitely not over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of things happening in</v>
<v Speaker 2>new electronic,</v>

8
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>applications in new,</v>

9
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare applications.</v>

10
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

11
00:00:46.701 --> 00:00:50.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going to power our economy going</v>

12
00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:55.370
<v Speaker 2>forward and is not a moment at which I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think anyone can say.</v>

13
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 2>We've run out of ideas at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've run out of credit now.</v>

14
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.343
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 2>a financing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

16
00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>people's new ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

17
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to turn that around.</v>

18
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.700
<v Speaker 2>There are certainly risks of not</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in technology.</v>

19
00:01:11.701 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 2>There are bigger risks of investing in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wrong technology.</v>

20
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the landscape is littered with</v>

21
00:01:20.821 --> 00:01:24.180
<v Speaker 2>corporations and government agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 2>that a revamped their computer systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

23
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly and,</v>

24
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 2>caused more chaos than the advantage of</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in new technology.</v>

26
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.410
<v Speaker 2>So the bottom line is got to do it very</v>
<v Speaker 2>carefully and have some very skilled</v>

27
00:01:43.411 --> 00:01:44.244
<v Speaker 2>people doing it.</v>

28
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.500
<v Speaker 2>Computers and telecommunications have</v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionized our,</v>

29
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way we conduct business and the way</v>

30
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 2>we conduct our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

31
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.783
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 2>problems are that we're overwhelmed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much information and too much noise</v>

33
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.720
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

34
00:02:08.721 --> 00:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real problem of surviving these a</v>

35
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.760
<v Speaker 2>wonderful innovations is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

37
00:02:15.171 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep a bit centered to this matters for</v>

38
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:20.150
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It matters for ordinary people,</v>

39
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

40
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not get overwhelmed and distracted by</v>

41
00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 2>the rapidity and the volume of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>information flow.</v>

42
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.180
<v Speaker 2>Technology is helping the government a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot and could help more</v>

43
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things go more smoothly.</v>

44
00:02:42.151 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 2>The government is involved in huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>information collection,</v>

45
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>operations.</v>

46
00:02:47.731 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it essentially runs a huge insurance</v>

47
00:02:50.611 --> 00:02:51.630
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

48
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 2>called social security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of information needs to be</v>

49
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.970
<v Speaker 2>collected and processed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

50
00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 2>that's a certainly a change the way the</v>
<v Speaker 2>government operates.</v>

52
00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.130
<v Speaker 2>One of the agencies that has had most a</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit,</v>

53
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 2>but also most trouble in getting into</v>
<v Speaker 2>the modern computer age,</v>

54
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the internal revenue service.</v>

55
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes are certainly processed more</v>

56
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 2>quickly and efficiently than they used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

57
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>But there's a long way to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.490
<v Speaker 2>in improving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

59
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.343
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.710
<v Speaker 2>computer systems that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

61
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>technology has also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

62
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 2>given,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 2>average people more access to government</v>
<v Speaker 2>information and,</v>

64
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

65
00:03:41.201 --> 00:03:42.790
<v Speaker 2>and help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

66
00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you can go on lots of websites and find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what's available to help your</v>

67
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.090
<v Speaker 2>particular business or help you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

68
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

69
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 2>a taxpayer on a particular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

70
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.840
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

71
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>there's a long way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

72
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 2>but both the federal government and</v>
<v Speaker 2>state and local governments are a much</v>

73
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:10.381
<v Speaker 2>more effective than they used to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have taken advantage of</v>

74
00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:16.021
<v Speaker 2>modern technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most major government agencies have a</v>

75
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:22.251
<v Speaker 2>chief technology officer and ought to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a most states and cities,</v>

76
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do as well.</v>

77
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

78
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.080
<v Speaker 2>clearly technology is extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>important to the functioning of any</v>

80
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:36.990
<v Speaker 2>large organization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a corporation or a</v>

81
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:40.560
<v Speaker 2>government agency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and somebody very highly qualified has</v>

82
00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:40.940
<v Speaker 2>to be</v>

83
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.773
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
