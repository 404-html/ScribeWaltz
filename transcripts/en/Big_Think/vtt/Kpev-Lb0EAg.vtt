1
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.570
<v Speaker 1>People are not fully rational and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do,</v>

2
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>they make many choices that if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>reflected upon them they would do</v>

3
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:17.460
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no question about that and we</v>

4
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>have a fair understanding actually of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening,</v>

5
00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>at least at the individual level of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>senses that we have explored a lot of</v>

6
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:27.240
<v Speaker 1>what is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say there's going to be no</v>

7
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>further progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we've explored in law,</v>

8
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major tendencies,</v>

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>well the major tendencies to people tend</v>
<v Speaker 1>to frame things very narrowly.</v>

10
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>They take a narrow view of decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>makings.</v>

11
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 1>They look at the problem at hand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they deal with it as if it were the only</v>

12
00:00:47.431 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very frequently.</v>

13
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:54.051
<v Speaker 1>It's a better idea to look at problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they will recur throughout your life</v>

14
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:58.560
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the policy that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to adopt for a class of problems.</v>

15
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to do would be a better thing.</v>

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 1>People frame things narrowly in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>

17
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:10.521
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will save and borrow at the same</v>

18
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:15.531
<v Speaker 1>time instead of somehow treating their</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole portfolio of,</v>

19
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>of assets as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as one thing.</v>

20
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:20.970
<v Speaker 1>If people were able to take a broader</v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

21
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>they would in general make better</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>So that is certainly one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the weaknesses of human decision</v>

23
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call it narrow framing.</v>

24
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 1>Mental accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>is is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way that we live.</v>

26
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:37.860
<v Speaker 1>So we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

27
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.730
<v Speaker 1>we keep our money in different mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts for which we have different</v>

28
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 1>rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people will,</v>

29
00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>well of course they spend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're spending money.</v>

30
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then there is a hierarchy of the</v>

31
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>accounts that they will touch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will spend money that they've</v>

32
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:57.240
<v Speaker 1>stalled for vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what often before they will spend</v>

33
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.260
<v Speaker 1>whatever they're thinking of a savings</v>
<v Speaker 1>for their children's education.</v>

34
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>So those are mental accounts for which</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have different rules more</v>

35
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.830
<v Speaker 1>foolishly versus pretty sensible because</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental accounting is a tool of self</v>

36
00:02:10.831 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But more foolishly,</v>

37
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:18.681
<v Speaker 1>investors tend to view each stock that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they buy as a mental account and they</v>

38
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>want to sell it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>when it is a winner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they tend to sell their winners</v>

40
00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and hang on to their losers in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>portfolio.</v>

41
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.870
<v Speaker 1>And that turns out to make them</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially poorer than if they had</v>

42
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>done things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you need to be numerate for certain</v>

43
00:02:37.771 --> 00:02:41.790
<v Speaker 1>kinds of decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So numerous people have a significant</v>

44
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:46.530
<v Speaker 1>advantage over those who are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding compounding compound</v>

45
00:02:46.531 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 1>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it makes a huge difference whether</v>

46
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>you're a credit card borrower or</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody was saving.</v>

47
00:02:52.621 --> 00:02:57.621
<v Speaker 1>People have a very hazy idea of compound</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest and,</v>

48
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>and it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I would say that first of all you</v>

49
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 1>need to be numerous that many people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

50
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>then you need to frame things broadly.</v>

51
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it frequently goes with numeracy but</v>

52
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:14.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not quite the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

53
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.430
<v Speaker 1>and then by taking the broad view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very important not to have overly</v>

54
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:28.111
<v Speaker 1>strong emotional reactions to events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what I mean by that is that most of</v>

55
00:03:28.721 --> 00:03:31.990
<v Speaker 1>us tend to respond to gains and two</v>
<v Speaker 1>losses,</v>

56
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>two changes that happen in our life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

57
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:41.041
<v Speaker 1>you're better off if you frame things</v>
<v Speaker 1>broadly and you think you win a few,</v>

58
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>lose a few,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have very limited emotional</v>

59
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:50.251
<v Speaker 1>response to small gains and two small</v>
<v Speaker 1>losses that tends to induce better</v>

60
00:03:50.861 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>decision making.</v>
