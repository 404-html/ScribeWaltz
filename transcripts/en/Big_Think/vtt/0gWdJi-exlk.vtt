1
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.023
<v Speaker 1>The key issue when you're looking at </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost cutting is to always plan for the </v>

2
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>the first set of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>of questions ask yourself when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing cost cutting is,</v>

5
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:21.840
<v Speaker 1>is relatively straight forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

6
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you use the,</v>

7
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.720
<v Speaker 1>the necessity of cost cutting as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to do pruning a trimming for</v>

8
00:00:27.721 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>projects that aren't being as </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

9
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

10
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 1>frequently though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are the easy ones.</v>

11
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's always some kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>social costs internal to the company,</v>

12
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:36.954
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the easy way of looking </v>

13
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the more difficult is,</v>

14
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>is if you have to make decisions about </v>
<v Speaker 1>resource allocations,</v>

15
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 1>about what you can apply to going to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

16
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>the algorithm or the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought analysis that you apply when</v>

18
00:00:50.311 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you look at this kind of cost cutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to be okay,</v>

19
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:53.904
<v Speaker 1>which of these things are most likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>return the company to a very strong </v>

20
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>position by which it can rigorously </v>
<v Speaker 1>invest in its future.</v>

21
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>And so the projects that make it are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that you know,</v>

22
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.854
<v Speaker 1>and those of course usually involve </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and resources are the ones that </v>

23
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>you are investing in your future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

24
00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the key algorithm.</v>

25
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Look at him and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

26
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>and whatever level of depth you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

27
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>You always looking to how do I rebuild </v>
<v Speaker 1>this thing into the future?</v>

28
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Managing risk is a key variable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly all aspects of life businesses,</v>

29
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.753
<v Speaker 1>just one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that most people </v>

30
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 1>do in terms of managing risks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

31
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:33.403
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually bad thinking is they </v>

32
00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:37.670
<v Speaker 1>think they can manage risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause zero everything has some risks.</v>

33
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drive your car down the street,</v>

34
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.393
<v Speaker 1>drunk driver may hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing is you're actually </v>

35
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:44.540
<v Speaker 1>trying to get to an acceptable level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk.</v>

36
00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Now in economic crisis times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things you're looking at is</v>

37
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>it's generally harder to get capital a </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue growth.</v>

38
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Maybe more revenue lines may be unstable</v>
<v Speaker 1>or growth may be a less easy to predict </v>

39
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>that you're going to get to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

40
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.193
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you do is you take a certain </v>

41
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:01.874
<v Speaker 1>conservative approach of when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as all entrepreneurs should do you plan </v>

42
00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>for both good luck and bad luck.</v>

43
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>You put extra time on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

44
00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>if I have bad luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do I do about that?</v>

45
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.880
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

46
00:02:13.881 --> 00:02:14.714
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you planned that the bad luck of </v>

47
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:16.214
<v Speaker 1>certainly going to happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're ready to adjust your </v>

48
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iterate,</v>

49
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact and,</v>

50
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 1>and presume that you have bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in for example,</v>

51
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:27.140
<v Speaker 1>a financing circumstance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if financing is much more difficult</v>

52
00:02:27.141 --> 00:02:27.974
<v Speaker 1>to get the new thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have the contingent monitoring </v>

53
00:02:30.411 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 1>points and the contingent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

55
00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:34.424
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what we can do in order to keep </v>

56
00:02:35.511 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>this company going and build it into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

57
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Even if financing is difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>times of economic crisis can change what</v>

58
00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>the competitive landscape looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because when,</v>

59
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:50.974
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have boom times capital's easy to </v>

60
00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:54.250
<v Speaker 1>come by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>growth as easy.</v>

61
00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes what you focus on is how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate in the boom during,</v>

62
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic crises.</v>

63
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.270
<v Speaker 1>The question is the companies that come </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of,</v>

64
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are sailing through that with the,</v>

65
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the best liquidity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both assets on the balance sheet,</v>

66
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>making money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to grow their businesses,</v>

67
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>get a disproportionate competitive </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

68
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So one of the really key things to look </v>
<v Speaker 1>at in terms of,</v>

69
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.833
<v Speaker 1>of crafting strategy when you're in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic crisis is how do you maximize </v>

70
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>your look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your essentially your liquidity position</v>

71
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>and your ability to both take kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits and revenues and in business and</v>

72
00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>then convert that into a stronger lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so those companies can do that,</v>

73
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually,</v>

74
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a march on the competitors.</v>

76
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.953
<v Speaker 1>The key thing for all businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially of course technology </v>

77
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:47.224
<v Speaker 1>businesses or businesses that deploy </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology as a key kind of strategic </v>

78
00:03:51.101 --> 00:03:53.980
<v Speaker 1>advantage is you always have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing in the future.</v>

79
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.203
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological change comes at </v>

80
00:03:56.711 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>accelerating rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are such things as,</v>

81
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moore's law and that sort of thing.</v>

82
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.623
<v Speaker 1>And that kind of bubbles up into kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>more feature sets and competitive </v>

83
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:05.404
<v Speaker 1>ability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the key thing is to invest in the </v>

84
00:04:07.421 --> 00:04:08.254
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is when you're </v>

85
00:04:09.341 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>deploying technology or you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology business is to make sure that</v>

86
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>you're keeping on the innovation cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're,</v>

87
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:16.323
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're both creating and adopting the </v>

88
00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:19.384
<v Speaker 1>new business practices and the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques in order to drive your </v>

89
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 1>business the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now a really key thing in terms of doing</v>

90
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:28.054
<v Speaker 1>that is staying in touch with the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your network and in your industry to </v>

91
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:31.564
<v Speaker 1>know what the benchmark is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to know what you should be doing in </v>

92
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.444
<v Speaker 1>terms of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

93
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.313
<v Speaker 1>what are the tools and techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>available and to be revving them as you </v>

94
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:38.500
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

95
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.333
<v Speaker 1>And that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is essential for B for maintaining </v>

96
00:04:41.381 --> 00:04:42.214
<v Speaker 1>a competitive edge and being successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>if your business and kind of serious </v>

97
00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:49.924
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make a decision about </v>

98
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:51.484
<v Speaker 1>whether or not you have a Sufi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like on an investor or </v>

99
00:04:53.261 --> 00:04:56.260
<v Speaker 1>venture capitalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decision can you take the assets are</v>

100
00:04:56.261 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>my you are and get to a place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're investing in the future.</v>

101
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you need to look for,</v>

102
00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:02.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially,</v>

103
00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>

104
00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you mass,</v>

105
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.520
<v Speaker 1>how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get the business to the place</v>

106
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.220
<v Speaker 1>where it can invest in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is sell the business.</v>

107
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Another is getting strong financing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of reinvest in the business.</v>

108
00:05:13.181 --> 00:05:14.014
<v Speaker 1>The way of doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key thing in any kind of guiding of </v>

109
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.333
<v Speaker 1>the business is how do you create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong organization that is kind of </v>

110
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>accelerating into the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you're in trouble,</v>

111
00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>the question is what are the techniques </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can,</v>

112
00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trim,</v>

113
00:05:28.271 --> 00:05:30.030
<v Speaker 1>refinance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soule,</v>

114
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera in order to get this business </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to that characteristic.</v>

115
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>The CEO's job is always about </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership.</v>

116
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.500
<v Speaker 1>It's about leadership on a vision in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of where you're going.</v>

117
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.363
<v Speaker 1>It's about making sure that people,</v>
