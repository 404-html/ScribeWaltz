00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>The</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

2
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.410
<v Speaker 2>It's under strain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're seeing manifestation of that</v>

3
00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 2>is and the rise of the independent voter</v>
<v Speaker 2>registration.</v>

4
00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I think the political system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at here in Washington from</v>

5
00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:23.880
<v Speaker 2>the governing standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's clearly broken.</v>

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 2>We're at gridlock on every issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fail to address issues of</v>

7
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 2>irresponsible spending or Medicare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social security,</v>

8
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 2>and we don't do any of the hard things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

9
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 2>we spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in a continuous battle over the</v>

10
00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.540
<v Speaker 2>war in Iraq and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 2>partisanship and bitterness is probably</v>
<v Speaker 2>as high level as I've seen it in all my</v>

12
00:00:46.581 --> 00:00:51.581
<v Speaker 2>years here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we sit down together for the good</v>

13
00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 2>of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know how to work across cio with</v>

14
00:00:56.851 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Democrats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I have for many years as president,</v>

15
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:03.180
<v Speaker 2>I will reach across my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the aisle to the Democrats,</v>

16
00:01:03.181 --> 00:01:07.610
<v Speaker 2>and I'll ask them to reach across to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'll ask the American people to urge</v>

17
00:01:07.611 --> 00:01:10.660
<v Speaker 2>him to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we get things accomplished,</v>

18
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 2>then obvious him all the credit.</v>
