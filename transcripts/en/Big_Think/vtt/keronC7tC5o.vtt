1
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>I think that there will always be small</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale scandals.</v>

2
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>There were always be plagiarist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will always be people who didn't</v>

3
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>make the phone calls that they claim to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be made.</v>

4
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.810
<v Speaker 1>But the chronic repeated abuse that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason Blair was engaged,</v>

5
00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:24.810
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it happened at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper that has a public editor or an</v>

6
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:26.280
<v Speaker 1>ombudsman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a phone number published in</v>

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.620
<v Speaker 1>the newspaper in The Times every day for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to call if they had something</v>

9
00:00:31.621 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>that they objected to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I got there I thought I'd try</v>

10
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>out the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.880
<v Speaker 1>it's a mailbox full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody had been paying attention to it.</v>

12
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>If you have somebody whose job is</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically to respond to readers who</v>

13
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:47.040
<v Speaker 1>are complaining or who are pointing out</v>
<v Speaker 1>error or pointing out misbehavior on the</v>

14
00:00:47.041 --> 00:00:49.410
<v Speaker 1>part of reporters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard.</v>

15
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine that it would not be</v>
<v Speaker 1>caught after the second or third time</v>

16
00:00:54.631 --> 00:00:56.960
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody reading that mail,</v>

17
00:00:56.961 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>somebody is paying attention to it.</v>

18
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 1>My biggest concern about the digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology as it's coming to the</v>

19
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>newsreel is anonymity of writers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

20
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 1>whether that's the person who's writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a blog or who's commenting,</v>

21
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

22
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>on a sign on assigned blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>we don't know who those people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

24
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>

25
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 1>and this is not an ethical issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a question of stability and</v>

26
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:22.921
<v Speaker 1>taste.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:22.921 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>it allows cowards to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that scrim while they have the freedom</v>

30
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>to say really awful and disgusting</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and I can't stand that.</v>

31
00:01:35.761 --> 00:01:37.370
<v Speaker 1>It's very upsetting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.870
<v Speaker 1>but beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been a few instances where</v>

33
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 1>that person who's been commenting on</v>
<v Speaker 1>this website or that website in fact as</v>

34
00:01:44.251 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>a principal in the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>is in fact a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a figure who has a self interest.</v>

36
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.670
<v Speaker 1>But as hiding that self interest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:51.671 --> 00:01:54.870
<v Speaker 1>I would really be delighted to see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>the websites of the world just suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 1>declare,</v>

39
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>put on your real name or we don't care</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you have to say.</v>

40
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.190
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care what you or you shouldn't</v>

41
00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 1>care what I have to say if I'm not</v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to put my name behind it.</v>

42
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

43
00:02:13.731 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>the peak years for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for quality journalism in this country,</v>

44
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>1970s and early 1980s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>if you go back before then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>pick up a copy of the New York Times in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1965 Sunday,</v>

47
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it was unbelievably dull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was officially is if the PR,</v>

48
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.460
<v Speaker 1>there were a new Peruvian ambassador</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointed there.</v>

49
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:35.130
<v Speaker 1>It was in the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

50
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>the shipping news that just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sort of,</v>

51
00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the kind of the deadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>required drone,</v>

53
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of news in those days was,</v>

54
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:47.340
<v Speaker 1>was really pretty awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paper got much,</v>

55
00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.680
<v Speaker 1>much better after that as an all</v>
<v Speaker 1>American journalism.</v>

56
00:02:49.681 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think the Watergate obviously had</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great deal to do with Watergate and</v>

57
00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:56.730
<v Speaker 1>also the magazine writers of the 60s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 1>like gay Talese and David Halberstam who</v>
<v Speaker 1>move both came out of the Times but then</v>

60
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>moved to other arenas to be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than simply chronicle.</v>

61
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>They could write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did more of that coming together.</v>

62
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the great victory for journalism</v>

63
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>that was Watergate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.340
<v Speaker 1>created a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the 70s that attracted better</v>

65
00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>people to the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a more exciting thing to do.</v>

66
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people did their greatest work then,</v>

67
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and the standards were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high.</v>

68
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we get into the 90s,</v>

69
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>and we began to have an economic trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to show up,</v>

70
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Time magazine where I worked for quite</v>

71
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>a while in 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 had eight full time critics on staff</v>

72
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.630
<v Speaker 1>doing different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.940
<v Speaker 1>today I think there's one full time</v>
<v Speaker 1>critic,</v>

74
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:40.803
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>not the criticism is the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing in the world,</v>

76
00:03:43.361 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>but I use it as an indication of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have shrunk back because of the</v>

77
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:48.250
<v Speaker 1>economic problems.</v>
