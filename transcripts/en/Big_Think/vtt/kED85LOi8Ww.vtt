1
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.480
<v Speaker 1>during a downturn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.470
<v Speaker 1>how much is advertising going to drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>by?</v>

4
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may drop by,</v>

5
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three percent,</v>

6
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be a total disaster for</v>

7
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>anybody except those who are really on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the margin.</v>

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time I think we're still</v>

9
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:35.901
<v Speaker 1>though we're experiencing a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm trend towards Internet based</v>

10
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:42.201
<v Speaker 1>advertising away from traditional media</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is probably a big enough factor</v>

11
00:00:44.461 --> 00:00:49.461
<v Speaker 1>that it would override for our industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any downturn in general ad revenues,</v>

12
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that what we haven't seen in the</v>

13
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I agree with John Battelle,</v>

14
00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>who says that we sort of went down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rat hole of a paper click advertising</v>

15
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>for a long time and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>

16
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of brand advertising,</v>

17
00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one that,</v>

18
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>that has not gotten,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gotten its due,</v>

19
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:14.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

20
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>in the online space.</v>

21
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.600
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because clicks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurable.</v>

22
00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>People over focused on clicks as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure of the effectiveness of the ad.</v>

23
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>And so we haven't seen a lot of really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big advertisers doing all that</v>

24
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>much online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

25
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but I think that'll change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:32.570
<v Speaker 1>just the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pick your random big hepatitis or</v>

28
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>like coca cola or Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not selling Coca Cola online</v>

30
00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>that it's not an ecommerce product and</v>
<v Speaker 1>never will be mcdonalds,</v>

31
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:46.200
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

32
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>and so measuring the success of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of an advertisement online by click</v>

33
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>through rate and the number of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who came and played with your stupid</v>

34
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:55.030
<v Speaker 1>flash animation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 1>maybe not that great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

36
00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.010
<v Speaker 1>I think instead they have to step back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

37
00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

38
00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>this is kind of like TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like a billboard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put up a billboard,</v>

40
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>we know how many people see it.</v>

41
00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>We really have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.860
<v Speaker 1>some historical understanding of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might mean for people thinking</v>

43
00:02:10.861 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>about coke when they go to buy a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beverage next time.</v>

44
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need a lot more of that on the</v>

45
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>web just to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

46
00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 1>actually we're gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna Mention Koch's name in a</v>

47
00:02:19.981 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>banner ad or in a little sidebar ad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we really don't care if people click</v>

48
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:25.110
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really don't care.</v>

49
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually just getting that word in</v>

50
00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:30.630
<v Speaker 1>front of people every day so that when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do get ready to think about it,</v>

51
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.740
<v Speaker 1>that's one type of product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another type of product would be a very</v>

52
00:02:34.741 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 1>information dense product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So something like a Toyota Prius right</v>

53
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the lure of interactive</v>

54
00:02:42.961 --> 00:02:45.340
<v Speaker 1>advertising is to actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>it is a bit ecommerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a bit get people to come and play</v>

56
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>with your stupid flash site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although hopefully it's not a stupid</v>

57
00:02:52.441 --> 00:02:53.040
<v Speaker 1>flash site.</v>

58
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.400
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>you can say in that space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

60
00:02:56.431 --> 00:03:01.431
<v Speaker 1>we actually feel like this is a product</v>
<v Speaker 1>that more people would want to buy a if</v>

61
00:03:01.511 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>they understood it better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>If we do research and we say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.540
<v Speaker 1>people kind of liked the idea of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaner,</v>

64
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>greener car with better gas mileage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

65
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they heard it some kind of hybrid and</v>

66
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>maybe they're a little scared of it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't know,</v>

67
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it run out of electricity or what</v>

68
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>is that all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the problems they face</v>

69
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just being hypothetical,</v>

70
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but it is a product where you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine that lots of people would like</v>

71
00:03:23.741 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>to go and learn more about it and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually maybe click and buy it,</v>

72
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's still like tons and</v>

73
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>tons of room for a lot more ad money to</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow into this space away from</v>

74
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>traditional models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

75
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.280
<v Speaker 1>and that'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be a stronger effect than,</v>

76
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.850
<v Speaker 1>than anything.</v>
