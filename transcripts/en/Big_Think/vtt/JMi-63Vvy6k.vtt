1
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>Depression is often misunderstood in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>

2
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:15.730
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes people think that people with</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression are weak or lazy when in</v>

3
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>actuality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>people with depression are struggling</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a very complex illness that has</v>

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychological,</v>

6
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>and social causes and consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression is extremely common.</v>

7
00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>It affects one in four women and about</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in five or six men,</v>

8
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>and those who don't experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression themselves often have a</v>

9
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:39.440
<v Speaker 1>friend or family member who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing it.</v>

10
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>The most commonly experienced symptoms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of depression are sad.</v>

11
00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:48.221
<v Speaker 1>Mood and lack of pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people often no sleep changes in energy</v>

12
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 1>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And almost everybody I've ever</v>

13
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>interviewed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would be over 2000 people with</v>

14
00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:54.470
<v Speaker 1>depression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll experienced feelings of</v>

15
00:00:54.471 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>worthlessness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every single one.</v>

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.500
<v Speaker 1>Depression is an invisible illness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not one that you can see just by</v>

17
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>looking at somebody's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadness can occur in response to life</v>

18
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:09.290
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression,</v>

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>at least in its later stages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to be disconnected from actual</v>

20
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>life events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So depression and sadness share the</v>

21
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but depression is so much more than just</v>

22
00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>sadness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a matter of fact,</v>

23
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.780
<v Speaker 1>some people think the worst part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression is now experiencing pleasure.</v>

24
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 1>There's a numbness and how sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people have severe depression field</v>

25
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>pull yourself up by the bootstraps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should get yourself out of this or</v>

26
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>things like your life is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to be depressed about?</v>

27
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Depression is definitely not related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's character or moral</v>

28
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.890
<v Speaker 1>shortcomings and it's really interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing that if medication can help</v>

29
00:01:49.891 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>people who have these illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could it really be about their</v>

30
00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>morality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depression can affect every aspect of a</v>

31
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:02.590
<v Speaker 1>person's life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can affect their job performance,</v>

32
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>their family relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their divorce rates are higher.</v>

33
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I can affect their parenting abilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>and depression is one of the leading</v>

34
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 1>causes of economic burden of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases.</v>

35
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>People are often surprised to hear that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs more to the society then cancer</v>

36
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>or heart disease.</v>

37
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 1>If depression goes untreated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could turn out a variety of different</v>

38
00:02:28.181 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be that people stay at the same</v>

39
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.980
<v Speaker 1>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.090
<v Speaker 1>negative level that they've been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or sometimes it can get much worse so it</v>

41
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:39.130
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with each passing depression,</v>

42
00:02:39.131 --> 00:02:44.131
<v Speaker 1>some people feel worse and worse so that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have approximately about 20</v>

43
00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:49.180
<v Speaker 1>percent of people I believe with major</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression ended up making some form of</v>

44
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:51.580
<v Speaker 1>suicide attempt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

45
00:02:51.581 --> 00:02:54.610
<v Speaker 1>how do we get people to feel better so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they can think better or vice</v>

46
00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 1>versa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we get them to think differently</v>

47
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.840
<v Speaker 1>so that they can feel differently?</v>

48
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>Usually people come at depression with</v>
<v Speaker 1>one form of treatment or the other.</v>

49
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>They'll either go and get medication or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goal get psychotherapy where they'll</v>

50
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

51
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 1>the data support that the best treatment</v>
<v Speaker 1>for depression is a combination of</v>

52
00:03:15.941 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>medication and psychotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lots of strategies</v>

53
00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>that people can use in order to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel better,</v>

54
00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving their sleep and sleep hygiene,</v>

55
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>exercising 30 minutes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

56
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Speaker 1>it's particularly aerobic exercise seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be very effective for people at</v>

57
00:03:33.341 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>depression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the social piece,</v>

58
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:40.801
<v Speaker 1>I'd really recommend to try to develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>more social engagement with people</v>

59
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.970
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one way that people can</v>

60
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>actually help themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To feel better.</v>

61
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that depression is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very treatable illness.</v>

62
00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>The majority of people who get care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly if they can get care early,</v>

63
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.470
<v Speaker 1>we'll end up doing very well.</v>
