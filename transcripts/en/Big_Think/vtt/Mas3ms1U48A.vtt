1
00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>Every every local car company in China</v>
<v Speaker 1>is working on hybrids.</v>

2
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>I'm in fact going back to a point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know Toyota makes it Prius,</v>

3
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>hybrid now in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>260,000 RMB.</v>

4
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Chung on a local car company makes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hybrid,</v>

5
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>so 160,000 RMB,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as good as that Prius.</v>

6
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you 100,000 RMB.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cheaper.</v>

7
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>Every single local car company and local</v>
<v Speaker 1>car companies account for 30 percent now</v>

8
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>the passenger car business agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truck and bus business almost</v>

9
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.200
<v Speaker 1>completely local.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no foreign company that has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaningful participation in that</v>

11
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.370
<v Speaker 1>commercial vehicle industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are a lot of local passenger</v>

12
00:00:53.371 --> 00:00:55.380
<v Speaker 1>car companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trucking companies and so forth.</v>

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>These lending companies that are all</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the environment,</v>

14
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>everybody's working on programs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the fuel efficiency and the</v>

15
00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>environmental impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the whole thinking about</v>

16
00:01:07.891 --> 00:01:12.600
<v Speaker 1>the environment in China's mind switched</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven years ago when they announced that</v>

17
00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Beijing would get the 2008 Olympics.</v>

18
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Think at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every official in China realized that in</v>

19
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>2008 for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people coming to China and</v>

20
00:01:22.141 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want the environment to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big issue,</v>

21
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>so there's a long way to go and believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

22
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:31.641
<v Speaker 1>China's got a huge environmental issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first step begins with thinking</v>

23
00:01:32.881 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>differently about your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's already happened and so</v>

24
00:01:35.791 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>everybody's conscious about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're working on it.</v>

25
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>A guarantee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the new innovations in,</v>

26
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.260
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the auto industry,</v>

27
00:01:43.261 --> 00:01:45.120
<v Speaker 1>are going to come out of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

28
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Because there's no single country in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world as a bigger vested interest in</v>

29
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 1>getting that done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then China,</v>

30
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>China needs to grow to lift up those</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither 1 million people to grow.</v>

31
00:01:55.741 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 1>It needs more transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the more transportation,</v>

32
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 1>the more pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it can't make available that</v>

33
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 1>transportation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's a constraint on growth.</v>

34
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.170
<v Speaker 1>So for China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of economic life and death</v>

35
00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.100
<v Speaker 1>to find better ways to do it and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I think is going to happen over the</v>

36
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:11.810
<v Speaker 1>next 10 years.</v>
