00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you think about building a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

2
00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I think you think about building a </v>
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>

3
00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people ask me</v>

4
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>the dieting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how did you start a company?</v>

5
00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:15.650
<v Speaker 2>And I always responded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we never started a company.</v>

6
00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.040
<v Speaker 2>A company is a byproduct of making a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great product.</v>

7
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.083
<v Speaker 2>We made six bags for Kate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We made two for Jack and made them </v>

8
00:00:22.941 --> 00:00:27.920
<v Speaker 2>really well and slowly but surely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.933
<v Speaker 2>found an audience for those bags,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sold them to the right stores who had </v>

10
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 2>the customers who we believed would </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate those.</v>

11
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.730
<v Speaker 2>So we limited the distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

12
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.593
<v Speaker 2>let it kind of go where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where would go naturally and really </v>

13
00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:42.890
<v Speaker 2>focused on the product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

14
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:43.724
<v Speaker 2>if you focus on the product and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch the market and you understand </v>

15
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:46.724
<v Speaker 2>where there are voids and you find </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that's new that satisfies a </v>

16
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 2>need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

17
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.270
<v Speaker 2>it's so old school and simple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

18
00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.430
<v Speaker 2>and be consistent about it and watch </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality,</v>

19
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 2>hire great people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really stay true to your original vision</v>

20
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 2>and then just expand on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

21
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 2>then you have a company and a brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.043
<v Speaker 2>France take a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't build history into something </v>

23
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 2>we can't compete with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Europeans have been around a hundred</v>

24
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.193
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we have to be more innovative and a </v>

25
00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 2>little bit more clever and intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

26
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.020
<v Speaker 2>because no one believes something's well</v>
<v Speaker 2>made when it's two years old,</v>

27
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.883
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

28
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 2>if you're a hundred year old company</v>

29
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 1>still going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you obviously know what you're doing.</v>

30
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.693
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
