1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.930
<v Speaker 1>That's how would be here for who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretend that you know,</v>

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.310
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know believe you really</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to disagree with you.</v>

3
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>I spend a lot of time with the stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open minded.</v>

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.630
<v Speaker 1>You are not</v>

5
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 2>this your Carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened to you man used to be</v>

6
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 2>affable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>used to be friendly.</v>

7
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 2>You used to wear a nice time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you wear bibs and I don't know.</v>

8
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.660
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know what happened to you</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

9
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:31.661
<v Speaker 2>but I want you to consider that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the scientific perspective,</v>

10
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 2>pick the number you like 97% of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world's scientists,</v>

11
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 2>very close to 100% of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists are very concerned about</v>

12
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:44.531
<v Speaker 2>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why aren't some people concerned</v>

13
00:00:44.721 --> 00:00:49.721
<v Speaker 2>about it when media outlets were allowed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be consolidated and the 1980s then it</v>

14
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 2>developed these two factions like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember it having a,</v>

15
00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:02.250
<v Speaker 2>and by that I think two factions or a</v>
<v Speaker 2>normal course of events where you,</v>

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 2>you have males and females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your boys and girls,</v>

17
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 2>whether it's fruit flies or dandelions</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you and me and in the World Cup</v>

18
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 2>soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up with two teams.</v>

19
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 2>The World Series Baseball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up with two teams.</v>

20
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:20.960
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to have three teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I think and we to two political</v>

21
00:01:20.961 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 2>parties normally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So somebody who understands this better</v>

22
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:27.020
<v Speaker 2>than I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who may observe that the media have</v>

23
00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:32.021
<v Speaker 2>divided into two camps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But from our point of view in the</v>

24
00:01:32.481 --> 00:01:37.100
<v Speaker 2>science and engineering side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to respect the facts at some</v>

25
00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 2>level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to respect their scientifically</v>

26
00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:45.401
<v Speaker 2>provable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then speaking of authorities and</v>

27
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 2>mistrust of authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowd on a,</v>

28
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.610
<v Speaker 2>at the inauguration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was objective,</v>

29
00:01:52.611 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 2>we smaller crowd than the crowd the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>day at the women's March.</v>

30
00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:59.300
<v Speaker 2>So when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone asserts that the crowd is</v>

31
00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>bigger when it was curly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller than everything else here she</v>

32
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 2>says subject to question and this has</v>
<v Speaker 2>led to a lot of trouble.</v>

33
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.361
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:12.290
<v Speaker 2>I think though that built into the u s</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

35
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 2>which includes the first amendment of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bill of rights,</v>

36
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 2>the freedom of the press built in is</v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

37
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.260
<v Speaker 2>So I'm very hopeful and optimistic that</v>
<v Speaker 2>things will change.</v>

38
00:02:24.261 --> 00:02:29.261
<v Speaker 2>That my understanding is subscriptions</v>
<v Speaker 2>to so called mainstream media,</v>

39
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Washington Post New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so on and have gone up in response</v>

40
00:02:34.101 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 2>to these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this approach to objective truths.</v>

41
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.000
<v Speaker 2>So that will probably be to the good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 2>but how are fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened and what will go wrong.</v>

43
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 2>In the meantime it says these are big</v>
<v Speaker 2>questions and then as far as my thing</v>

44
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 2>with Mr. Carlson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

45
00:02:51.291 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 2>he used to not interview that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to not just talk about it</v>

46
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>because it's unknowable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

47
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>It takes you quite a bit less than six</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

48
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.680
<v Speaker 2>I go back again in a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mr. Carlson,</v>

49
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.830
<v Speaker 2>do you have me on again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will come right back on.</v>

50
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Bring it on man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what else Mr. Carlson,</v>

51
00:03:13.731 --> 00:03:18.731
<v Speaker 2>I'll bet you $10,000 that 2010 2020 will</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the hottest decade on record.</v>

52
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I offered a bed of $10,000 to Joe</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bastardi who is a Fox News contributor</v>

53
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.490
<v Speaker 2>and Marc Morano who I'm not sure as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>contributor,</v>

54
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.490
<v Speaker 2>but used to appear on your station</v>
<v Speaker 2>routinely.</v>

55
00:03:31.491 --> 00:03:36.230
<v Speaker 2>You're a network routinely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet them each 10,000 bucks,</v>

56
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.500
<v Speaker 2>2010 2020 will be the hottest decade on</v>
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>

57
00:03:39.501 --> 00:03:42.560
<v Speaker 2>I bet them each another 10th.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

58
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.570
<v Speaker 2>did I say 20 10,000 bucks on the decade?</v>
<v Speaker 2>10,000 Bucks on the year 2016 2016 would</v>

59
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:53.060
<v Speaker 2>have been among the top 10 hottest years</v>
<v Speaker 2>on record.</v>

60
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.220
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

61
00:03:55.221 --> 00:03:58.610
<v Speaker 2>there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 was the hottest year on record.</v>

62
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 2>And your guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the people that Fox News here to forest</v>

63
00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:07.070
<v Speaker 2>supports in this would not take either</v>
<v Speaker 2>bet.</v>

64
00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:10.430
<v Speaker 2>$40,000 wouldn't take the bet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could have been theirs.</v>

65
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm good for it.</v>
