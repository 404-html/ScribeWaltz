<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no question that the United</v>

2
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a matter of policy,</v>

3
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>must be against torture with sign</v>
<v Speaker 1>treaties to that effect.</v>

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>We brought people to trial</v>
<v Speaker 1>internationally because we accused them</v>

5
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:28.001
<v Speaker 1>of torture and some of the things the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration did fall into the</v>

6
00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>same category of tortures as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese.</v>

7
00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:37.490
<v Speaker 1>We tried after World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legacy of the George W dot Bush</v>

8
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:42.491
<v Speaker 1>administration will be calamity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>calamity for our country here in America</v>

9
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.870
<v Speaker 1>and for the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those eight years.</v>

10
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:55.871
<v Speaker 1>We went backwards almost the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much damage was caused to the quality</v>

11
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:02.090
<v Speaker 1>of our government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good people left the government in</v>

12
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>droves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The executive branch was politicized by</v>

13
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.530
<v Speaker 1>when no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothings do nothings and they stopped</v>

15
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:17.531
<v Speaker 1>functioning and all the problems we had</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and abroad just festered and got</v>

16
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 1>worse and got worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a legacy.</v>
