<v Speaker 2>I'm Alice Rivlin and I'm a senior fellow</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the Brookings Institution.</v>

5
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.700
<v Speaker 2>There are some quite obvious things that</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies can do a right now,</v>

6
00:00:35.791 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 2>depending on what kind of companies they</v>
<v Speaker 2>are.</v>

7
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we're fixing our crumbling</v>

8
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.390
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that specialize in doing that,</v>

11
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will benefit if we're giving more people</v>

12
00:00:47.761 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 2>access to broadband,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

14
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>

15
00:00:52.171 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an opportunity if we're making our</v>

16
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 2>healthcare system more efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There will be some people who will lose</v>

17
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.550
<v Speaker 2>by that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.910
<v Speaker 2>but there will also be both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 2>providers and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthcare,</v>

22
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology industry that will benefit</v>

23
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the stimulus plan is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

24
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:24.620
<v Speaker 2>widely misunderstood because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>think of it as just infrastructure.</v>

25
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.740
<v Speaker 2>It is partly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

26
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important part of the stimulus</v>

27
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:35.561
<v Speaker 2>I thought were the parks that got money</v>
<v Speaker 2>to individuals so that they could keep</v>

28
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 2>paying their bills.</v>

29
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means the food stamp part of the</v>

30
00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:46.650
<v Speaker 2>unemployment benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

31
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 2>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.530
<v Speaker 2>the modest increase in social security</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits and the other part that seemed</v>

33
00:01:55.131 --> 00:02:00.131
<v Speaker 2>to me very important were the benefits</v>
<v Speaker 2>to states to keep them from cutting back</v>

34
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 2>on their services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

35
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't even mention the tax cuts</v>

36
00:02:07.341 --> 00:02:12.341
<v Speaker 2>which go to ordinary people and those</v>
<v Speaker 2>things will keep demand up.</v>

37
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>It will keep a consumption up and it'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit the businesses across the board.</v>

38
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 2>There's no special benefit here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just means that people will not be</v>

39
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 2>cutting back on their consumption as</v>
<v Speaker 2>much as they ordinarily would have.</v>

40
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 2>We were bringing a lot of talent to Wall</v>
<v Speaker 2>Street that in my opinion would have</v>

41
00:02:40.631 --> 00:02:43.690
<v Speaker 2>been better employed doing something</v>
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>

42
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 2>The financial services industry got way</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of kilter with the rest of the</v>

43
00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Financial services are supposed to be</v>

44
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 2>serving the rest of the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

45
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.840
<v Speaker 2>our services industry got into a</v>
<v Speaker 2>position where it was largely servicing</v>

46
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need that many smart people</v>

47
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>inventing more and more complex</v>
<v Speaker 2>derivatives and instruments to sell to</v>

48
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:15.150
<v Speaker 2>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

49
00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 2>there is very little social benefit in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that activity.</v>

50
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean we can close down all the</v>

51
00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>derivatives markets or anything like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

52
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

53
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if compensation in financial services is</v>

54
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:36.841
<v Speaker 2>less astronomical and we attract less of</v>
<v Speaker 2>our high,</v>

55
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.840
<v Speaker 2>a high skilled talent into financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>services and more of it into other parts</v>

56
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 2>of the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll be all to the good.</v>

57
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>This massive disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

58
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:58.170
<v Speaker 2>has certainly exposed weaknesses in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial sector.</v>

59
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some we knew were there,</v>

60
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 2>many we didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we need a drastic overhaul,</v>

61
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:10.531
<v Speaker 2>I think on two fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Partly it is a question of modernizing</v>

62
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:16.591
<v Speaker 2>our regulatory system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which simply did not keep up with the</v>

63
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:21.841
<v Speaker 2>advances in financial innovation and</v>
<v Speaker 2>globalization that were happening all</v>

64
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:27.841
<v Speaker 2>around us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means a stricter regulation for</v>

65
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>major institutions that are very</v>
<v Speaker 2>interlinked with the rest of the</v>

66
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And indeed with the global economy,</v>

67
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>they can't be too strict.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need those major institutions.</v>

68
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 2>The second front,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I think is more important,</v>

69
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.420
<v Speaker 2>is we need to go over our economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure or economic architecture and</v>

70
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:55.111
<v Speaker 2>look for perverse incentives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Places where there are incentives that a</v>

71
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.120
<v Speaker 2>meaning that people can make a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money doing something really risky.</v>

72
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.540
<v Speaker 2>Now we had a good example of that in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mortgage lending,</v>

73
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:13.060
<v Speaker 2>mortgage lending standards got very lax</v>
<v Speaker 2>in part because we missed a perverse</v>

74
00:05:15.041 --> 00:05:15.874
<v Speaker 2>incentive.</v>

75
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.150
<v Speaker 2>We missed the fact that the loan</v>
<v Speaker 2>originator has no reason to worry about</v>

76
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>the credit worthiness of the borrower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't keep any of that risk</v>

77
00:05:29.711 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he's just a selling this,</v>

78
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:38.431
<v Speaker 2>a mortgage to somebody else as part of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>package backing a bond issue,</v>

79
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 2>then he has no reason to worry about</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether the borrower can repay.</v>

80
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 2>That was a perverse incentive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had been there for awhile,</v>

81
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 2>but nobody noticed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the big influx of capital into</v>

82
00:05:52.601 --> 00:05:57.601
<v Speaker 2>the mortgage backed security market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of it coming from that exposed this</v>

83
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.960
<v Speaker 2>weakness and we have to look for things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that and change them.</v>

84
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that President Obama has to work</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now on the thing that is most</v>

85
00:06:15.091 --> 00:06:18.240
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>namely getting out of this recession and</v>

86
00:06:18.241 --> 00:06:21.840
<v Speaker 2>getting the financial services industry</v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning again.</v>

87
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.890
<v Speaker 2>If he doesn't accomplish that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think he will,</v>

88
00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:30.420
<v Speaker 2>it will be a disaster for business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

89
00:06:30.421 --> 00:06:34.230
<v Speaker 2>we need a functioning economy where</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have jobs.</v>

90
00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 2>We need to be a more sustainable economy</v>
<v Speaker 2>than we were before,</v>

91
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 2>both in an environmental sense and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the sense that we need to save more</v>

92
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.290
<v Speaker 2>and finance more of our own investment</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of domestic saving.</v>

93
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I think that will happen because people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who borrowed too much and consumed too</v>

94
00:06:59.851 --> 00:07:03.570
<v Speaker 2>much got badly burned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we need an economy which is</v>

95
00:07:03.571 --> 00:07:07.890
<v Speaker 2>functioning well and in which people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>saving more,</v>

96
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 2>borrowing less and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing more productive</v>
