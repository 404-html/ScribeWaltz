00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>When I first came to the Aspen ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>festival,</v>

2
00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I was very intimidated because most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people here have written a book.</v>

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.130
<v Speaker 1>They are an elected official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

4
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>they're running a multinational</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation.</v>

5
00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>I spend much of my time in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>developing world,</v>

6
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>in a mud hut where there's no running</v>
<v Speaker 1>water or electricity.</v>

7
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think what it's given me is to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>my own words is the,</v>

8
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>as shown me the power within me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

9
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>it has given me a voice and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to be an advocate for those</v>

10
00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 1>people who really don't have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to share their story.</v>

11
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And there are very few of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals here,</v>

12
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:48.670
<v Speaker 1>as much as they have traveled and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been to the developing world,</v>

13
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>they haven't had an opportunity really</v>
<v Speaker 1>to experience through the eyes of the</v>

14
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:56.560
<v Speaker 1>people who live there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what I value about this is that it's</v>

15
00:00:56.561 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>given me an opportunity to share with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they are the policy makers.</v>

16
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>And my hope is that I've been able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe shape or influence them in such a</v>

17
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>way that they're able to leave having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better understanding of the people that</v>

18
00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:12.520
<v Speaker 1>they touch.</v>
