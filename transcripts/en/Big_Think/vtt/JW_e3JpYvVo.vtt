1
00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>A few important things that patients</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to do in order to prevent a</v>

2
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>recurrence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing is to really</v>
<v Speaker 1>manage,</v>

4
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own follow up appointments.</v>

5
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a few of us that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised that doctors don't send that</v>

6
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>little card out in the mail to remind</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

7
00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>like a dentist used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>to remind you of those followup</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointments.</v>

9
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>It's your responsibility to manage those</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you've got several doctors</v>

10
00:00:39.781 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>appointments to follow up depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the type of a treatment.</v>

11
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 1>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to,</v>

12
00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:48.090
<v Speaker 1>to follow up with my surgeon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>oncologist,</v>

13
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.100
<v Speaker 1>my radiologist and a for a while first</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and my plastic surgeon.</v>

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there were several appointments that</v>

15
00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>I needed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to manage and monitor.</v>

16
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.380
<v Speaker 1>And that is critical that you stay on</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of that.</v>

17
00:01:01.381 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>They're not going to call and remind you</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

18
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen and a,</v>

19
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 1>so it's your responsibility.</v>

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>I also believe that changing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle is important.</v>

21
00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the lifestyle you have had</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

22
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>

23
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 1>We're hair starts to grow back and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to feel better and healthy and</v>

24
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>your life moves on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day you had cancer</v>

25
00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>and it's now lifestyle that you need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>monitor and manage.</v>

26
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>That means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at your diet and eating healthy</v>

28
00:01:32.341 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>there's been a big link to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having extra weight and,</v>

31
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>and fat in the Diet and on your body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a linking with cancer.</v>

32
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So being healthy and eating well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise.</v>

33
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just being very cognizant of how</v>

34
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel on a day to day basis,</v>

35
00:01:53.731 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>how your body feels and recognizing any</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential symptoms to,</v>

36
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make that phone call.</v>

37
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>If there's any concern.</v>

38
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

39
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>I definitely treated this cancer a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little differently than the first one.</v>

40
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>I knew to take care of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to stay positive.</v>

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I need to wait to find out all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

42
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went to see my doctors before I</v>

43
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>panicked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before I went to the website.</v>

44
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>So I implemented everything that I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from experience.</v>

46
00:02:35.011 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did exactly what I tell everybody else</v>

47
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I followed the rules.</v>

48
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>I called my insurance insurance carrier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

49
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made sure to have all my questions ready</v>

50
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:48.420
<v Speaker 1>before and prepare it before my doctor's</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointments.</v>

51
00:02:48.421 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>I had all my paperwork and my slides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathology report.</v>

52
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

53
00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>asked all the questions and had several</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions before we went ahead and made</v>

54
00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>the final decision of the ta type of</v>
<v Speaker 1>treatment that I would,</v>

55
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take on.</v>

56
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even going through the process,</v>

57
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hate to say it,</v>

58
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Speaker 1>but a variant cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

59
00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had breast cancer.</v>

60
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>I know what the surgery is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

61
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I've had that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

62
00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

63
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I've had chemotherapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:16.894
<v Speaker 1>it was</v>

65
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.540
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

66
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>about 10 times harder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.180
<v Speaker 1>with the surgery and the chemo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a bit of a surprise.</v>

68
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 1>But the process remains exactly how I</v>
<v Speaker 1>knew to get through it.</v>

69
00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:32.621
<v Speaker 1>And I was able to stay positive and keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>my family from panicking and my friends</v>

70
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:37.010
<v Speaker 1>from panicking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unfortunately one of the jobs</v>

71
00:03:37.011 --> 00:03:37.760
<v Speaker 1>that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.330
<v Speaker 1>sometimes we end up taking on is keeping</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else calm.</v>

73
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when your friends and families start to</v>

74
00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:45.680
<v Speaker 1>really panic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I was very lucky.</v>

75
00:03:45.681 --> 00:03:48.830
<v Speaker 1>I got again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity to see some wonderful</v>

76
00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>doctors I had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

77
00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.380
<v Speaker 1>I what else?</v>

78
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.723
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

79
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.410
<v Speaker 1>I have my counselor one on one planner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Aye.</v>

80
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.273
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

81
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

82
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.020
<v Speaker 1>just before I was about to go to pressed</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to prepare this planner for people</v>

83
00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:12.680
<v Speaker 1>with breast cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to stop the process where we're at</v>

84
00:04:12.681 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of editing and about to</v>
<v Speaker 1>send it to the printer.</v>

85
00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 1>And I grabbed the prototype and I used</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and I though it was designed for</v>

86
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:22.750
<v Speaker 1>people with breast cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the organizer component.</v>

87
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really got me through the process</v>

88
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>and was able to keep me calm and focused</v>
<v Speaker 1>about my next steps.</v>

89
00:04:29.571 --> 00:04:31.880
<v Speaker 1>I had a place to put all my</v>
<v Speaker 1>appointments,</v>

90
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.280
<v Speaker 1>my notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my business cards,</v>

91
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 1>and it really helped my mother who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>flew in from Chicago to be with me.</v>

92
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.151
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a mother,</v>

93
00:04:41.151 --> 00:04:44.930
<v Speaker 1>she was just devastated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the plan are really kept us</v>

94
00:04:44.931 --> 00:04:48.260
<v Speaker 1>both organized and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All our notes were in one place where we</v>

95
00:04:48.261 --> 00:04:49.700
<v Speaker 1>could share this book together.</v>
