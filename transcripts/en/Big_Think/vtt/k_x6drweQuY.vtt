1
00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.390
<v Speaker 1>The communication internet is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is something that's ubiquitous and we're</v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.930
<v Speaker 1>using it 24 hours a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of us have our cell phones and our</v>

3
00:00:06.931 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>desktop computers and we're generating</v>
<v Speaker 1>information in the form of audio,</v>

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.970
<v Speaker 1>video and text.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we're sharing it with friends,</v>

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>were sharing it with the world in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a communication network that's</v>

6
00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>designed to be distributed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborative and that favors peer to</v>

7
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>peer production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that Communication Internet is</v>

8
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:32.451
<v Speaker 1>converging with this very nascent energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet where we're now able to</v>

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.800
<v Speaker 1>generate our own green electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributed collaborative peer to peer</v>

10
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and share it with the help of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication internet,</v>

11
00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>we create an energy internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transmission lines become an internet.</v>

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>And now the third component,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are just beginning to see the first</v>

13
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:55.581
<v Speaker 1>glimpse of an automated transport and</v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics internet and then the whole</v>

14
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>package is complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

15
00:00:58.651 --> 00:01:00.900
<v Speaker 1>logistics is a pretty inefficient</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

16
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take a look across the United</v>

17
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like other countries,</v>

18
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and you look at a truck on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes those trucks are empty,</v>

19
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>they're deadheading back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd taken their cargo and then</v>

20
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.370
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing on the trip back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or they only have 20 or 30% of that</v>

21
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>truck filled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now,</v>

22
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>our logistics system is not coordinated</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a network.</v>

23
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>There are thousands of warehouses and</v>
<v Speaker 1>distribution centers,</v>

24
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>but every company usually has only five</v>
<v Speaker 1>or 10 of these warehouses somewhere in</v>

25
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have to take their,</v>

26
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>their trains are the trucks all the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to where they're a handful of centers</v>

27
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:35.970
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what would happen if all the</v>

28
00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>thousands of warehouses and distribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>centers,</v>

29
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.580
<v Speaker 1>privately owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came together in a cooperative network.</v>

30
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>So if you're a general electric or</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walmart or wherever,</v>

31
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>or a PR,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small prosumer,</v>

32
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.320
<v Speaker 1>a small and medium sized company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have access to any one of</v>

33
00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>those warehouses when they have surplus</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and you could move your transport</v>

34
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>only where you needed it in real time</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of going to a few centralized</v>

35
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>warehouses across 3000 miles.</v>

36
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 1>But to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to have common protocols</v>

37
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>where everything is standardized so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get your packages through in the</v>

38
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:16.191
<v Speaker 1>same containers with radio recognition</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology like federal express as so</v>

39
00:02:16.441 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 1>you know where you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're afraid is in your package at any</v>

40
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>given moment on the supply chain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we're now starting to move</v>

41
00:02:23.731 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>toward a driverless vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be in mass production within</v>

42
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>five to 10 years everywhere according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the six major auto companies.</v>

43
00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 1>And so we'll be able to have a transport</v>
<v Speaker 1>system where we power our vehicles from</v>

44
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>energy from our energy internet and will</v>
<v Speaker 1>power our electric vehicles and fuel</v>

45
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>cell cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks and buses powered by hydrogen,</v>

46
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.860
<v Speaker 1>all of that from our energy internet at</v>
<v Speaker 1>near zero marginal cost transport that's</v>

47
00:02:51.961 --> 00:02:55.470
<v Speaker 1>already here in parts of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We now have electric vehicles,</v>

48
00:02:55.471 --> 00:03:00.020
<v Speaker 1>fuel cell vehicles powered with energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's near zero marginal costs.</v>

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>In a few years there'll be driverless</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing the cost even further.</v>

50
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And so this transport and logistics</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet is connecting with the energy</v>

51
00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>internet and the communication internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which provides the data one system.</v>

52
00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It is a game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the great technology</v>

53
00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>revolutions in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to change our entire way of</v>

54
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single person.</v>

55
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>What it mainly means is it's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratization of everything.</v>

56
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.460
<v Speaker 1>This means that millions of people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon billions of people,</v>

57
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.380
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to have to rely on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goodwill of a handful of globally</v>

58
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.450
<v Speaker 1>integrated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

59
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>vertically integrated companies for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>main stuff of life.</v>

60
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>We've now freed ourselves with</v>
<v Speaker 1>information to zero or near zero</v>

61
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.120
<v Speaker 1>marginal cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions of us are producing and sharing</v>

62
00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we now have the first early adopters</v>

63
00:03:56.171 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>that are now producing their own green</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity at near zero marginal costs,</v>

64
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>millions of them already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've just starting to see a</v>

65
00:04:04.571 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>transport and logistics internet that</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get us to near zero marginal cost.</v>

66
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>This is the democratization of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything and it's going to change the</v>

67
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.210
<v Speaker 1>economic model.</v>
