1
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Software unification</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that I no longer care what computing</v>

2
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>device I pick up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a laptop or a desktop,</v>

3
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's one I own or one in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>public place,</v>

4
00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it has a small screen or a large</v>

5
00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I sit down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify myself,</v>

7
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>I tune in my information world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I get it in the same way on a no screen</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer in a car.</v>

9
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uniform access across all platforms,</v>

10
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:48.610
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>telephones to my entire information</v>

11
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to achieve in hardware.</v>

12
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 1>They're hard software issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they should have been solved 15</v>

13
00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:58.204
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

14
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.260
<v Speaker 1>So long from the other side of the fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

15
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to invest in a,</v>

16
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 1>in a new company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would invest in some of the companies</v>

17
00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>that are working on so-called digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>furnaces.</v>

18
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in five years,</v>

19
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:19.360
<v Speaker 1>everybody throws out all his cds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dvds.</v>

20
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.750
<v Speaker 1>There are larger MP3 players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a home stereo systems and t v V systems</v>

21
00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>are integrated and this is a billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>multibillion dollar transition.</v>

22
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.080
<v Speaker 1>As things stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will be Sony and Google a Toshiba,</v>

23
00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:37.300
<v Speaker 1>a few with very large companies doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they won't,</v>

24
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.280
<v Speaker 1>they won't do it badly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they won't do it.</v>

25
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:40.420
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I would invest in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one of the small companies that has</v>

27
00:01:44.531 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>imaginative instead of recycled ideas as</v>
<v Speaker 1>to how to make that transition.</v>

28
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two ways.</v>

29
00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>The service that print media</v>
<v Speaker 1>traditionally makes available,</v>

30
00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is editing,</v>

31
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>which can turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost,</v>

32
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>almost unintelligible random words into</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligible language depending on how</v>

33
00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>good a writer you're dealing with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

34
00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.970
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of mankind today</v>
<v Speaker 1>writes badly and finds it difficult to,</v>

35
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>may have good ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but finds it difficult to write more</v>

36
00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>than an articulate sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really judging by my students,</v>

37
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:27.650
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:29.180
<v Speaker 1>each year my students at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

39
00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>which is a good university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get very good.</v>

40
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Students are less and less able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express themselves in writing.</v>

41
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So the print media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 1>more than ever provides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

43
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editing and provides,</v>

44
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority,</v>

45
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>respectability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I go to a new stand 30 years ago and</v>

46
00:02:52.851 --> 00:02:56.000
<v Speaker 1>there are five newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important for me to know that I</v>

47
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Speaker 1>trust this newspaper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't trust that one.</v>

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>But if today I go to the web and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>are 30,000 sites,</v>

49
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>it's even more important for me to go to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a site,</v>

50
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>which I have some reason to trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently over the longterm.</v>

51
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>I think the print media have failed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the most of their opportunity.</v>

52
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>They know they may have all disappear</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're approaching things in</v>

53
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 1>the wrong way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

54
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.790
<v Speaker 1>but editing to produce coherent readable</v>
<v Speaker 1>text and authority so that readers know</v>

55
00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>how to spend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how much information there is.</v>

56
00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I asked the same number of minutes in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>day and,</v>

57
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>and I need to look to sources I trust</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning with a print media,</v>

58
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read magazines,</v>

59
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I read publishers I trust to give me</v>
<v Speaker 1>advice as to how to spend those minutes.</v>

60
00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.260
<v Speaker 1>Print media will flourish if it does</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

61
00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>Don't know that it will.</v>

62
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.520
<v Speaker 1>The first part of your question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>livestreaming is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we defined it in first implemented it</v>

64
00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>back in the mid 1990s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.720
<v Speaker 1>was a time based versus space are</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface based organization of</v>

66
00:04:01.721 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that every electronic</v>

67
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>assets you had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every piece of information,</v>

68
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>whether it was an email or an instant</v>
<v Speaker 1>message,</v>

69
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a file or a spreadsheet,</v>

70
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a photo or an MP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three would appear in a single time</v>

71
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:22.381
<v Speaker 1>ordered stream that mirrored the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of your life.</v>

72
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>So in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing on the stream would be</v>

73
00:04:25.211 --> 00:04:27.910
<v Speaker 1>my birth certificate and the electronic</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that.</v>

74
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>My parents would put my records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>school records,</v>

75
00:04:31.301 --> 00:04:32.160
<v Speaker 1>health records,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

76
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>when on a child onto the stream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Stream is um,</v>

77
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to flow forward through time.</v>

78
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 1>I can deal with the future is available</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me as well as the past.</v>

79
00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>So I can search in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find what I want,</v>

80
00:04:48.101 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>everything is fully indexed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

81
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if when I schedule things,</v>

82
00:04:52.241 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>when I know things are coming up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put them in the future.</v>

83
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 1>When I have something that I need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>return to that I don't have time for</v>

84
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:58.810
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put it in the future.</v>

85
00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.741
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:04:59.741 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>and together without,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had an interface,</v>

87
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought it was important not to make</v>

88
00:05:06.251 --> 00:05:09.010
<v Speaker 1>use only or the surface of the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

89
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>but to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>present displays in depth that made use</v>

90
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>of the other virtual depth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

91
00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 1>So I wasn't looking at a surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was more looking through a window into</v>

92
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>an arbitrarily large information</v>
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

93
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>So instead of the mouse just moving a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cursor over the surface,</v>

94
00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>it would be a robot vehicle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>moving through three space or some</v>
<v Speaker 1>arbitrary space.</v>

96
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the basic idea was simple,</v>

97
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.690
<v Speaker 1>just a chronological timeline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heterogeneous with absolutely everything</v>

98
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>we have seen it a commercialized in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>

100
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way I,</v>

101
00:05:44.861 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>the one that I'm allowed to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

102
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:53.290
<v Speaker 1>I no longer own these patents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The patents have changed hands and the</v>

103
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 1>patents are now subjective at enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit against Apple,</v>

104
00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>which is not mine because I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patent I'm told is the largest</v>

105
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>lawsuit in patent history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcohol took these ideas.</v>

106
00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm not in a position to say they stole</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

107
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:10.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if they did or not legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these ideas are the basis of apples,</v>

108
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover flow,</v>

109
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 1>the way they display,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

110
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.890
<v Speaker 1>originally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

111
00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs on itunes cover flow is now become</v>

112
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.870
<v Speaker 1>a standard way of displaying files on</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually all apple platforms,</v>

113
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>spotlight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

114
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>which allows you to find files not by</v>
<v Speaker 1>name or folder,</v>

115
00:06:30.081 --> 00:06:31.100
<v Speaker 1>but by content.</v>

116
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and time machine,</v>

117
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:34.930
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a series of,</v>

118
00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>of archive things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

119
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.910
<v Speaker 1>without commenting on the legal aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm not capable of doing.</v>

120
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Those are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are live streams and there are</v>

121
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>other companies that have done similar</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

122
00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes me angry personally,</v>

123
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.110
<v Speaker 1>not because of the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the deliberate failure to</v>

124
00:06:54.111 --> 00:06:59.111
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge work that we would have made</v>
<v Speaker 1>freely available as academics.</v>

125
00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

126
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.210
<v Speaker 1>companies nowadays will not acknowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>it because there's so much money</v>

127
00:07:05.211 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same time on the network,</v>

128
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.020
<v Speaker 1>there are thousands of groups that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are building livestreams or live</v>

129
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>streaming for themselves in their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

130
00:07:14.391 --> 00:07:16.820
<v Speaker 1>We love to see this activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a live stream,</v>

131
00:07:16.821 --> 00:07:18.740
<v Speaker 1>that blog talking about all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different life finger.</v>

132
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

133
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.520
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for that matter,</v>

134
00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>we're delighted to see apple do it too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>but when they're large companies that</v>
<v Speaker 1>work on it,</v>

136
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 1>which is also the case with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with friend feed,</v>

137
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the,</v>

138
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.470
<v Speaker 1>with the event stream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

139
00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.460
<v Speaker 1>on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

140
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is true of the aol aol Bebo</v>

141
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:42.140
<v Speaker 1>Stream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they actually call a live stream</v>

142
00:07:42.141 --> 00:07:42.974
<v Speaker 1>or live streaming.</v>

143
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

144
00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:46.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not as if we want to stop that</v>

145
00:07:46.191 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut it down,</v>

146
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 1>but we'd like to see credit where credit</v>
<v Speaker 1>is due,</v>

147
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>not just to me or even mean mainly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

148
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but to the graduate student actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>built the software,</v>

149
00:07:55.821 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>worked tremendously hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>published the papers,</v>

150
00:07:58.611 --> 00:07:59.444
<v Speaker 1>put them in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

151
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>made them available and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd like to see credit awarded.</v>

152
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:13.270
<v Speaker 1>There are certain subjects we'd seem to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me can be taught very effectively</v>

153
00:08:13.611 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 1>online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although they aren't.</v>

154
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see writing taught</v>
<v Speaker 1>online because of the university like</v>

155
00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less than a high school where my</v>

156
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 1>boys went to school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a public high school in new haven in</v>

157
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are not enough teachers who are</v>

158
00:08:29.811 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 1>able to teach writing well or in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases there are none.</v>

159
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Well there are always a few.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teaching somebody to write is a isn't a</v>

160
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.390
<v Speaker 1>labor intensive activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to go through somebody's paper</v>

161
00:08:41.391 --> 00:08:45.080
<v Speaker 1>and mark it up as a copy editor would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>sentence by sentence and I have to do</v>

162
00:08:45.081 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>that repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I could have a student take a hate</v>

163
00:08:49.941 --> 00:08:53.920
<v Speaker 1>the paper and send it to somebody in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alaska or India or anywhere who's</v>

164
00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 1>capable of doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A worldwide network of writing,</v>

165
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 1>teaching would be very effective.</v>

166
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.280
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the right software tools.</v>

167
00:09:02.281 --> 00:09:06.480
<v Speaker 1>We will at some point similarly for</v>
<v Speaker 1>marking exercises,</v>

168
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>quantitative exercises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe not so much in mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly problem sets in physics</v>

170
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 1>and chemistry and engineering and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and things like that.</v>

171
00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:17.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we're answers and methods are</v>

172
00:09:17.761 --> 00:09:19.300
<v Speaker 1>clear cotton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see that done online.</v>

174
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the universities as we know them</v>

175
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>will be dead in 10 or 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to see them replaced by</v>

176
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>something better instead of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

177
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:33.210
<v Speaker 1>And it's not clear which way it will go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the book is,</v>

178
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:38.211
<v Speaker 1>I'm abolishing the book is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>abolishing the symphony or Sonata form</v>

179
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:44.190
<v Speaker 1>or the sonic or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the wall painting.</v>

180
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

181
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:49.140
<v Speaker 1>the book is a form in which some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest masterpieces that mankind has</v>

182
00:09:49.141 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>ever achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our are expressed.</v>

183
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>not only fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

185
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.550
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're great biographies.</v>

186
00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Biographies is the greatest story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

187
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are great science books that were</v>

188
00:10:01.741 --> 00:10:04.040
<v Speaker 1>conceived as books,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fiman Savers,</v>

189
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.830
<v Speaker 1>introductory lectures and physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which have a beginning and an end which</v>

190
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:10.880
<v Speaker 1>are written with style and penalize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The book is,</v>

191
00:10:10.881 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>is a unit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's such a brilliant Ergonomic unit.</v>

192
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I take a book,</v>

193
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I can judge a book by its cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can glance at it from the outside,</v>

194
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:23.370
<v Speaker 1>know what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can tell if it's a novel or a textbook</v>

195
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:25.800
<v Speaker 1>or a history book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can look at the side and tell about</v>

196
00:10:25.801 --> 00:10:29.040
<v Speaker 1>how long it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can flip through it and I don't need a</v>

197
00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:31.920
<v Speaker 1>map to know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the table of contents are.</v>

198
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 1>The index is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can find the photograph.</v>

199
00:10:34.381 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 1>If they're a second no photographs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can write on it,</v>

200
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 1>which is tremendously important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I read a book,</v>

201
00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value to it,</v>

202
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:44.310
<v Speaker 1>to me and having the book another time</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to remember what I said,</v>

203
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:46.350
<v Speaker 1>what I wanted to know and so forth.</v>

204
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:49.440
<v Speaker 1>It's portable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to worry about stepping on</v>

205
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:50.730
<v Speaker 1>it accidentally or I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I can use it on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can use it on anywhere.</v>

207
00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Standing up in a boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

208
00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:57.263
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

209
00:10:57.450 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it is the greatest design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

210
00:11:00.361 --> 00:11:03.280
<v Speaker 1>in the history of ergonomics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a piece around it as long time</v>

211
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:06.270
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have books because there are</v>

212
00:11:06.271 --> 00:11:09.640
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so brilliantly there.</v>

213
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:13.410
<v Speaker 1>They're there so brilliantly suited to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way human beings absorbed</v>

214
00:11:13.411 --> 00:11:16.770
<v Speaker 1>information and at their best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're among the most beautiful things</v>

215
00:11:16.771 --> 00:11:18.630
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

216
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

217
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's terrible to think of.</v>

218
00:11:21.601 --> 00:11:23.370
<v Speaker 1>They're disappearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surviving only in,</v>

219
00:11:23.371 --> 00:11:26.730
<v Speaker 1>in libraries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not going to happen.</v>

220
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>People are too smart to allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if the industry sometimes seems so</v>

221
00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:33.600
<v Speaker 1>oblivious that it wouldn't care.</v>
