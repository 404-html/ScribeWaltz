1
00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:02.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.600
<v Speaker 2>I would say the most fascinating part</v>
<v Speaker 2>about saving that really motivates most</v>

3
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.160
<v Speaker 2>people and in particular young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this whole notion of compound growth.</v>

4
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 2>we all learned this in our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in our math classes,</v>

6
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 2>but what happens is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is we save a little money and then it</v>

7
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 2>earns interest or return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then our interests in our,</v>

8
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 2>in the mount we saved starts to grow</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself and it just keeps snowballing.</v>

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you a little,</v>

10
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little like sample,</v>

11
00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 2>which is unrealistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it really shows compound growth.</v>

12
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you had a penny and it doubled every</v>

13
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.850
<v Speaker 2>day for 30 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that penny would grow to over $10</v>

14
00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.260
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now certainly we have our money doesn't</v>

15
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.590
<v Speaker 2>grow that quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you show a young person just</v>

16
00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:51.424
<v Speaker 2>even,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm having an eight to 10% growth rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

18
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:57.340
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money that you will have</v>

19
00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 2>at a later age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really life changing and very</v>

20
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 2>motivating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

21
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:06.310
<v Speaker 2>I think compound growth is the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really the key to that,</v>

22
00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 2>which also the other key or motivator is</v>
<v Speaker 2>having options in your life,</v>

23
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.640
<v Speaker 2>being able to do the things that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise never,</v>

24
00:01:12.641 --> 00:01:13.474
<v Speaker 2>ever could do.</v>

25
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.413
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

26
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Well that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's this whole concept of,</v>

27
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>of compound growth that's you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earning interest or,</v>

28
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 2>or having growth on your dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

29
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.190
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so what happens is the growth itself</v>

30
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>starts to grow and earn income on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it as well.</v>

31
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 2>So it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

32
00:01:37.391 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 2>the snowball effect where it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it grows and grows and grows really</v>

33
00:01:41.831 --> 00:01:44.350
<v Speaker 2>fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>similar to how that penny grew.</v>

34
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

35
00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 2>saving today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's you know,</v>

36
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.320
<v Speaker 2>today allows it to grow from war</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomorrow.</v>

37
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we try to do is get the word out to as</v>

38
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 2>many young people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At Schwab we save,</v>

39
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 2>you were in your teens or in your 20s</v>
<v Speaker 2>save 10% of your income for the rest of</v>

40
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 2>your life and you will be financially</v>
<v Speaker 2>secure.</v>

41
00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.030
<v Speaker 2>But if you wait until your thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to save 15 to 20%</v>

42
00:02:16.491 --> 00:02:19.280
<v Speaker 2>of your income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in your forties we say,</v>

43
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 2>ouch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

44
00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.350
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

45
00:02:21.351 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 2>25% of your income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty difficult to do.</v>

46
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 2>So the sooner you can start,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the easier is on your pocketbook.</v>

47
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
