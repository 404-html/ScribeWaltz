1
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Most psychologists agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best way to have somebody increase</v>

2
00:00:09.531 --> 00:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>empathy is to engage in something called</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective taking.</v>

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Imagining that you're someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to cognitively and emotionally</v>

4
00:00:16.731 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>understand some event from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Often.</v>

6
00:00:21.651 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning I don't know what's going on</v>

7
00:00:24.171 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>through your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have an experience of what it's</v>

8
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>like to be you and it's also very</v>
<v Speaker 1>effortful.</v>

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to actually imagine what it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to be someone else and in fact,</v>

10
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're often thinking about unpleasant</v>

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:36.741
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

12
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:39.290
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be homeless and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain doesn't want to go there.</v>

13
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.190
<v Speaker 1>So vr is a really neat tool because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes that cognitive effort out.</v>

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.420
<v Speaker 1>It makes increases accuracy so you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>not operating on stereotypes.</v>

15
00:00:47.421 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>You may have in your mind what you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually experience the life of someone</v>

16
00:00:51.171 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>else as as that person lives.</v>

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>Since 2003 I've been running experiments</v>
<v Speaker 1>that take a person,</v>

18
00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>puts her in virtual reality and gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>her an experience that you couldn't have</v>

19
00:01:00.831 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could be being in a different place</v>

20
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>or could actually be becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different person.</v>

21
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 1>So the first study we ran was about</v>
<v Speaker 1>ageism and we took college age students</v>

22
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>and they walked up to a virtual mirror.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason we have a virtual mirror</v>

23
00:01:16.551 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>is to show the person there they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>become different via a process called</v>

24
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.380
<v Speaker 1>body transfer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a neuroscientific process where</v>

25
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>if you move your physical body and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an Avatar that moves what's called</v>

26
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:31.250
<v Speaker 1>synchronously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that beans at the same time that you</v>

27
00:01:31.251 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>move your arm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see it's our move.</v>

28
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:36.950
<v Speaker 1>And you see that in a mirror as well on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first person over time.</v>

29
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 1>The part of the brain that contains the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schema for the self expands and includes</v>

30
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>this external representation as part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body.</v>

31
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>So by using a virtual mirror and showing</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody moving with a mirror,</v>

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you can literally feel like you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>become someone else.</v>

33
00:01:50.361 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>You can be a different gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different age,</v>

34
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can become disabled,</v>

35
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>you can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a different skin color.</v>

36
00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And our first study took college aged</v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

37
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>We had them become older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about 60 to 70 years old.</v>

38
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.290
<v Speaker 1>We then network the second person into</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual reality.</v>

39
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.420
<v Speaker 1>And there was a conversation between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

40
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>Over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation turned to stereotypical</v>

41
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 1>concepts about being older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So perhaps you didn't have a good memory</v>

42
00:02:16.071 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 1>and the stereotypes were activated in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conversation.</v>

43
00:02:19.131 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So while wearing the body of someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>else who's an older person,</v>

44
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 1>I felt discrimination firsthand as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

45
00:02:25.551 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>And what we showed in that first study</v>
<v Speaker 1>published in 2005 was that subjects who</v>

46
00:02:30.051 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 1>had gone through this treatment became</v>
<v Speaker 1>less ageist.</v>

47
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they came out.</v>

48
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.590
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask them to list words about the</v>

49
00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:39.620
<v Speaker 1>elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were less likely to list a words</v>

50
00:02:39.621 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>that were stereotypical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since that first study,</v>

51
00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 1>we've run dozens of studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at empathy in terms of</v>

52
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>becoming a different race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming different gender,</v>

53
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>even becoming a different specie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you become a cow,</v>

54
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>how does that make you think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>animals?</v>

55
00:02:54.081 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And what our research has shown is vr is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a magic tool.</v>

56
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work every single time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

57
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>but in general across all of our studies</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Vr tends to outperform control</v>

58
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

59
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>imagining you're someone else via role</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing or reading about case studies,</v>

60
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>this experience of walking a mile in</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's shoes,</v>

61
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>it tends to be more effective at causing</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy and behavior change towards</v>

62
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the 2018 tribeca film festival,</v>

63
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>we're going to premiere a piece called</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand cut journey.</v>

64
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm working with Courtney cogburn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a professor at Columbia and she</v>

65
00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>studies implicit bias and black white</v>
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

66
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>The piece is designed to show how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>of color do not experience racism once</v>

67
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:34.550
<v Speaker 1>or twice in their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

68
00:03:34.551 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 1>it's a process they go through pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>much every day.</v>

69
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>And so this piece is you start out as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>elementary school child and you're in a</v>

70
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>you then become a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>and you're interacting with police</v>
<v Speaker 1>officers.</v>

73
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.600
<v Speaker 1>You then become an adult who's going on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a job interview and what you experienced</v>

74
00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:57.601
<v Speaker 1>while wearing the body of a black male</v>
<v Speaker 1>is implicit bias that happens repeatedly</v>

75
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>and over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a piece that's going to</v>

76
00:04:00.581 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 1>premiere in April.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we're currently doing is</v>

77
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.741
<v Speaker 1>running experiments to test to see if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes attitudes and what aspects of</v>

78
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>the experience are most effective at</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing those attitudes.</v>
