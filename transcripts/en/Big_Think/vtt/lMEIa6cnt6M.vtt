00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.153
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.930
<v Speaker 2>The first started working on this book I</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrote to do lists the same way that most</v>

3
00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:11.530
<v Speaker 2>people write to do lists and it turns</v>
<v Speaker 2>out this is exactly the wrong way to</v>

4
00:00:11.531 --> 00:00:14.350
<v Speaker 2>write it to do list according to</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologist and neurologist.</v>

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 2>I would sit down in the morning and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>would just jot down all the tasks I</v>

6
00:00:18.311 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 2>wanted to do that day and I would put on</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple of things at the top of my page</v>

7
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 2>that were like pretty easy to do cause</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cause I,</v>

8
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 2>it felt so good to cross those off like</v>
<v Speaker 2>early in the day and feel a sense of</v>

9
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 2>accomplishment and I'd put my big tasks</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the bottom of the page.</v>

10
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes at the top of the page I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>even write things that I had already</v>

11
00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 2>done because it just made me so happy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>like sit at my desk and be able to cross</v>

12
00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 2>something off right away.</v>

13
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Psychologists call this using a to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>list for mood repair rather than for</v>

14
00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:48.850
<v Speaker 2>productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it turns out this is exactly the</v>

15
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 2>wrong way to write a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do list the right way to write a,</v>

16
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:55.060
<v Speaker 2>to do list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that genuinely productive people</v>

17
00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 2>and companies write to do lists is it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that at the top of the page,</v>

18
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 2>they write their big ambition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their stretch goal.</v>

19
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>They write something that seems almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to achieve because that</v>

20
00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:10.780
<v Speaker 2>reminds you all day long what you</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually want to get done.</v>

21
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 2>And then underneath they write out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan,</v>

22
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 2>they write a smart goal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they break that big ambition into small</v>

23
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 2>components.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that gives me a way to start in the</v>

24
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's important is that when I get</v>

25
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 2>something accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I'm able to cross something off my</v>

26
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 2>to do list,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't experience that sense of relief</v>

27
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 2>that allows me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 2>go spend half an hour or 90 minutes like</v>
<v Speaker 2>on facebook,</v>

29
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like I,</v>

30
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>I can take a break and I can go waste</v>
<v Speaker 2>time wandering around.</v>

31
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready to start on the next task</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the top of my page.</v>

32
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 2>I'm constantly being reminded that</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I'm making incremental</v>

33
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:51.490
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is in service to a bigger goal.</v>

34
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.180
<v Speaker 2>There's something bigger and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaningful that I want to accomplish</v>

35
00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 2>this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as long as I'm being reminded of</v>

36
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I still have a plan study after</v>

37
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 2>study shows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more likely to get more things</v>

38
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.600
<v Speaker 2>done and to focus on the right things</v>
<v Speaker 2>each day.</v>

39
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 3>Mm.</v>
