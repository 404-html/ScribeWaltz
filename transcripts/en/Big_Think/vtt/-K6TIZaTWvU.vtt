1
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the key lessons or</v>

2
00:00:06.661 --> 00:00:11.661
<v Speaker 1>reminders is how intertwined main street</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Wall Street really is.</v>

3
00:00:12.691 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>When we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.551 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 1>working with the federal government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.300
<v Speaker 1>during the Aig crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my biggest concerns and that very</v>

6
00:00:23.341 --> 00:00:28.341
<v Speaker 1>rapid collapse of aig was how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in this country could have</v>

7
00:00:30.151 --> 00:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>liquidity choked out and they didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

8
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:34.391
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

9
00:00:34.391 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>it was coming too quickly and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>implications across the country were</v>

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think one,</v>

11
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>recognizing how important it is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a safe yet robust financial system if we</v>

13
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 1>hope to have financial growth is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

14
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.023
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>reminder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that in fact,</v>

16
00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a healthy financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

17
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fund the growth that small,</v>

18
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>medium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>large companies and individuals need and</v>

19
00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 1>deserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>

20
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the relationship between main</v>

21
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:17.400
<v Speaker 1>street and Wall Street is important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curbing excesses is clearly important</v>

22
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.380
<v Speaker 1>and I think putting us on a stable base</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can have that consistent growth in</v>

23
00:01:22.381 --> 00:01:25.110
<v Speaker 1>the industry to support capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

24
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.390
<v Speaker 1>we can't have the growth that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the country needs to do.</v>

26
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>You can have the growth economy needs.</v>

27
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm generally an optimist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I've seen so many cycles in my</v>

28
00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:48.021
<v Speaker 1>23 years in the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started in August of 1987 only to see</v>

29
00:01:49.261 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>the market have one of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>crashes ever in October of 87.</v>

30
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>And seeing a number of other cycles and</v>
<v Speaker 1>after each one,</v>

31
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 1>lessons or lessons are learned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the pendulum often</v>

32
00:02:03.511 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>swings too far one way before it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>back the other way.</v>

33
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>But there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important learning and growth</v>

34
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that comes out of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.070
<v Speaker 1>each one of these situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is clearly more profound than what</v>

36
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>we've seen in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many decades.</v>

37
00:02:21.961 --> 00:02:25.950
<v Speaker 1>And so one would hope that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>building the right foundation to grow</v>

38
00:02:25.951 --> 00:02:26.760
<v Speaker 1>from the space.</v>
