1
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My book is an optimistic book because I</v>

2
00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:08.990
<v Speaker 1>argue about all of our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>our limitations and how empathy leads us</v>
<v Speaker 1>astray.</v>

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>But in order to make that argument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have to have an appreciation</v>

5
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>that we're smart enough to realize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy could lead us astray and that</v>

6
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>we're smart enough to ask those to</v>
<v Speaker 1>override.</v>

7
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>It's pernicious effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's empathy that causes me to favor,</v>

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody who looks like me over somebody</v>

9
00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.351
<v Speaker 1>who does a tour or a somebody from my</v>
<v Speaker 1>country or ethnicity over a stranger.</v>

10
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 1>But it's rationality that leads me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

11
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not reasonable.</v>

12
00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.680
<v Speaker 1>There is no reason to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

13
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>It's not impartial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we should try to override</v>

14
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my outlook is very optimistic.</v>

15
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of reason and rationality</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can work together and deliberate</v>

16
00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.560
<v Speaker 1>and talk and argue and through this come</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some great accomplishments.</v>

17
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>So what I argue is that we have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for rationality and reason.</v>

18
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>This is actually fairly controversial in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my field.</v>

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my fellow psychologists,</v>

20
00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:16.320
<v Speaker 1>philosophers and neuroscientists often</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue that we're a prisoners of the</v>

21
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>emotions that were fundamentally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>profoundly irrational.</v>

22
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>And that reason plays very little role</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our everyday lives,</v>

23
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>determinism of a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

25
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we,</v>

26
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:30.300
<v Speaker 1>what we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we act,</v>

27
00:01:30.301 --> 00:01:35.301
<v Speaker 1>how we think is a product of events that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have started a very long time ago plus</v>

28
00:01:36.691 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>physical law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are just kind of pr.</v>

29
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>We are physical creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are not,</v>

30
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:43.650
<v Speaker 1>we can't escape from causality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just continue doing what we're</v>

31
00:01:43.651 --> 00:01:46.080
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the main goals of my work is to</v>

32
00:01:46.081 --> 00:01:48.600
<v Speaker 1>argue against that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that notion is a more</v>

33
00:01:48.601 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>responsibility can we reconcile with</v>
<v Speaker 1>determinism?</v>

34
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>But I think determinism is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but none of that challenges rationality.</v>

35
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And as an illustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could imagine a computer that's</v>

36
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>entirely determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also entirely rational.</v>

37
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>You could imagine on another computer is</v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely determined but as capricious</v>

38
00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:14.421
<v Speaker 1>and arbitrary and random.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so even in a deterministic universe</v>

39
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>to question remains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what sort of computer are we?</v>

40
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Are we are emotional creatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we rational creatures?</v>

41
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>But there is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the slightest bit of inconsistency</v>

42
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>between the claim that we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>determine universe and that we're</v>

43
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>rational reasoning creatures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's worked with science.</v>

44
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Science is the paradigmatic case where</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exercise of reason by ESD is</v>

45
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.620
<v Speaker 1>imperfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People has come up with extraordinary</v>

46
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:43.710
<v Speaker 1>discoveries about the origin of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe to origin of life,</v>

47
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.160
<v Speaker 1>the atomic structure of material</v>
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>

48
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>amazing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we could do the same thing</v>

49
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:54.090
<v Speaker 1>with mortality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people can argue and deliberate</v>

50
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.040
<v Speaker 1>about morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

51
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 1>whenever I say this and whenever I talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about about empathy,</v>

52
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I always get a cynical response.</v>

53
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 1>And the cynical response is I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable enough,</v>

54
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>which is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that's not how it works in the real</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

56
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I was reminded recently that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to live in a post fact world</v>

57
00:03:10.061 --> 00:03:11.160
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

58
00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>the real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the real world,</v>

59
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>people are persuaded by whoever yells</v>
<v Speaker 1>the loudest,</v>

60
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:20.740
<v Speaker 1>whoever appeals to their self interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever tweaks their emotions,</v>

61
00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Speaker 1>including empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I honestly don't doubt that that's</v>

62
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a short term.</v>

63
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want it to persuade somebody to go</v>

64
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>to war against Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give money to this cause,</v>

65
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.600
<v Speaker 1>to expel that group from my country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would appeal to their emotions and</v>

66
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>anybody who appeals to their emotions</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be much more successful in those</v>

67
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>who attempt to make a rational</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliberate of argument.</v>

68
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.960
<v Speaker 1>But I think in a long run over time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason and rationality tends to win out.</v>

69
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>I look at the world we're in now and for</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of its many flaws and problems,</v>

70
00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.750
<v Speaker 1>I see signs of those moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments all over the place where</v>

71
00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I think we care more for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had forgotten about that.</v>

72
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>We have a broader moral circle as Peter</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singer would say.</v>

73
00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>We are less prone to kill each other as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Pinker has demonstrated in his</v>

74
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of explanation for</v>

75
00:04:16.811 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 1>these changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think one key component has been</v>

76
00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 1>exercise of reason and I'm optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll continue to see in the future.</v>
