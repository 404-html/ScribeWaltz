1
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I think a system like hello health could</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely encourage more people to go</v>

2
00:00:13.841 --> 00:00:16.570
<v Speaker 1>into primary cabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So however,</v>

3
00:00:16.571 --> 00:00:18.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the past at least 10 years,</v>

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 1>about 5% of doctors have been going into</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary care.</v>

5
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most high performing health care systems</v>

6
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:26.000
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>have about 75% primary care doctors in</v>
<v Speaker 1>25% specialists and America.</v>

8
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereabouts exactly opposite.</v>

9
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have 75% specialists and we're about</v>

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:39.940
<v Speaker 1>two generations of doctors behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>curve on this one.</v>

11
00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.350
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once boomers retire or die,</v>

13
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primary care sort of dead with them.</v>

14
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is unfortunate because that's</v>

15
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:51.970
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>that's what sort of controls your</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and your health.</v>

17
00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the person that you should be</v>

18
00:00:57.971 --> 00:00:59.840
<v Speaker 1>able to depend on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>specialists are making double,</v>
<v Speaker 1>triple,</v>

21
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 1>quadruple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>as much as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as primary care doctors.</v>

23
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>and seeing like half as many patients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the incentive for doctors to</v>

25
00:01:14.021 --> 00:01:16.120
<v Speaker 1>go into primary care?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

26
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.280
<v Speaker 1>there's not much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.350
<v Speaker 1>hello health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system like hello health,</v>

28
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that encourages and pays primary care</v>

29
00:01:23.141 --> 00:01:26.530
<v Speaker 1>doctors for communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And pays them more on par with,</v>

30
00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>specialists would absolutely I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

32
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there are other issues where,</v>

33
00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:37.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medical sort of institutions devalue</v>

34
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.373
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.100
<v Speaker 1>art talent of primary care in exchange</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

36
00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big bad neurosurgeon,</v>

37
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect they get.</v>

38
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

39
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the kind of stuff I'm sort</v>

40
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>of thinking about right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

41
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>what I think is most interesting about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the death of primary care and the con</v>

42
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>and this then the rise of the Internet</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

43
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think about it,</v>

44
00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet connecting me with</v>

45
00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.280
<v Speaker 1>information and connecting me with</v>
<v Speaker 1>patients is actually doing something</v>

46
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting to,</v>

47
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the practice of medicine.</v>

48
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend about one hour a year with</v>

49
00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:28.541
<v Speaker 1>doctors and about 8,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>765 without doctors.</v>

50
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean to your life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 1>doctors aren't the cure all for your</v>
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>

52
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are right.</v>

53
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:36.404
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

54
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.770
<v Speaker 1>you're sort of like the CEO of your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>body and your doctor is a sort of a</v>

55
00:02:39.771 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>consultant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you call it every once in a while,</v>

56
00:02:41.721 --> 00:02:42.554
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.780
<v Speaker 1>So that basically means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.590
<v Speaker 1>there are a ton of tools that are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>now springing up,</v>

59
00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that connect us with good information</v>

60
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.670
<v Speaker 1>that's relevant to you as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect us with other patients who are</v>

61
00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.670
<v Speaker 1>having similar problems as you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

62
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that the Internet can prevent,</v>

63
00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>office visits,</v>

64
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 1>especially primary care visits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.050
<v Speaker 1>and help people take care of themselves</v>
<v Speaker 1>better is tools.</v>

66
00:03:08.051 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

67
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can connect with doctors via video</v>

68
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:13.160
<v Speaker 1>chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

69
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.170
<v Speaker 1>I think those tools have serious issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>there because nobody really uses video</v>

70
00:03:17.171 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>chat with strangers and who are the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doctors that are on video chat where</v>

71
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>they're seeing patients in our office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

72
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that there are opportunities</v>

73
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>to build so to systems like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the issue is how do you,</v>

74
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>when people need a prescription maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.860
<v Speaker 1>for say antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

76
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>and I can't really be done over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

77
00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with today's sort of laws and</v>

78
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.420
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>
