1
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>I never really wanted to be a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I got very interested in physics</v>

2
00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>when I was about 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.670
<v Speaker 1>I had quit school when I was 13 and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I just somehow got interested in physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

5
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 1>and then I just thought I'd studied for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile until I could do something else.</v>

6
00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just things happened in such a way that,</v>

7
00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:36.020
<v Speaker 1>that never happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to be an editor for fiction or</v>

9
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.824
<v Speaker 1>a filmmaker,</v>

10
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.273
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 1>or a great writer or a jazz musician</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't really smart enough to be</v>

12
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>any of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately.</v>

13
00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.773
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

14
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing about particle physics is</v>

15
00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:02.241
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>it's very intellectually alluring and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're,</v>

17
00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 1>you get to do a lot of really fun things</v>
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

18
00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Like you get to build huge experiments</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you actually do it yourself.</v>

19
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>So you get to drive forklifts and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to work with flammable gases and</v>

20
00:01:18.201 --> 00:01:21.960
<v Speaker 1>explosive things and you get to drill</v>
<v Speaker 1>things and,</v>

21
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.200
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get to think about,</v>

22
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics and philosophical</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

24
00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And you get to do write computer code.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to do a lot of things that are</v>

25
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.170
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fun and you don't normally get to</v>

26
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>do them in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually you just like move into an</v>

27
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.120
<v Speaker 1>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's already made and then you just cook</v>

28
00:01:42.121 --> 00:01:42.591
<v Speaker 1>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:01:42.591 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case started.</v>

30
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.880
<v Speaker 1>You get to build the whole thing and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>wire it and do everything does that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that may not make any sense,</v>

32
00:01:51.021 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>but you really get to do a lot of fun</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

33
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that sort of kept me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kept me in it.</v>
