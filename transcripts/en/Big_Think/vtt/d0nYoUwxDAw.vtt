1
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>We all have intrusive thoughts from time</v>
<v Speaker 1>to time and many of us,</v>

2
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will check whether we have our airplane</v>

3
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>ticket before going to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than once.</v>

4
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>That isn't ocd tebow CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have obsessions and</v>

5
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:25.871
<v Speaker 1>compulsions that impair your life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>are highly distressing and of rule.</v>

6
00:00:26.001 --> 00:00:29.810
<v Speaker 1>A sort of rule book would be maybe at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least an hour a day.</v>

7
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>But most of the patients that I work</v>
<v Speaker 1>with will obsess and compulsive for</v>

8
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>hours a day and really their life can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined.</v>

9
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>So I have some patients will come to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>

10
00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I don't need to be washing my</v>

11
00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>hands like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I can't stop.</v>

12
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>And I have other patients who are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>not sure,</v>

13
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.490
<v Speaker 1>really not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they really believed that if they</v>

14
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>don't wash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe they'll actually get ill.</v>

15
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's that sort of range of</v>
<v Speaker 1>insight.</v>

16
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>It's also true that someone in my office</v>
<v Speaker 1>can say,</v>

17
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the subway safe and I could touch</v>

18
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:03.980
<v Speaker 1>that pole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I walk onto the subway with them</v>

19
00:01:03.981 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>doing an exposure and ask them to touch</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pole in front of me,</v>

20
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.240
<v Speaker 1>they lose their ability to ha to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>remember that this isn't going to kill</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

22
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>So obsessive compulsive disorder is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disorder where patients have obsessions</v>

23
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.040
<v Speaker 1>and compulsions and obsessions are</v>
<v Speaker 1>intrusive thoughts,</v>

24
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>images or urges that they find very</v>
<v Speaker 1>distressing and are very repetitive and</v>

25
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>compulsion's our behavioral acts or</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental acts,</v>

26
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>things they do in their head over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again to try to reduce the</v>

27
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>distress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that obsessions cause or to follow</v>

28
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>specific rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while all patients with ocd have</v>

29
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>obsessions and compulsions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

30
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>the content of the obsessions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>compulsions can really vary.</v>

31
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.770
<v Speaker 1>So one type of patient can have</v>
<v Speaker 1>intrusive concerns about contamination</v>

32
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.160
<v Speaker 1>and they baby washing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing elaborate washing rituals.</v>

33
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>A different patient might have intrusive</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts about harming either other</v>

34
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>people or harm befalling themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they,</v>

35
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>might have rituals of checking to make</v>

36
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>sure that the harm didn't happen yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another type of OCD patient might have</v>

37
00:02:17.791 --> 00:02:22.791
<v Speaker 1>what's called just so ocd where</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to be either arranged,</v>

38
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>are ordered in a certain way or they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to actually do things in a certain</v>

39
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>way and they may be repeating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>rearranging and organizing all day long.</v>

40
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.470
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a group of people who have what</v>

41
00:02:34.471 --> 00:02:39.471
<v Speaker 1>we call intrusive taboo thoughts that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be about sex or religion or,</v>

42
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.320
<v Speaker 1>or violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And often these are images that they</v>

43
00:02:43.321 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

44
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>they might have elaborate rituals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reassure themselves that they actually</v>

45
00:02:47.941 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't actually commit any of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>acts.</v>

46
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like ocd patients only have</v>

47
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 1>often ocd patients have more than one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these types of obsessions and</v>

49
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>compulsions together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's sort of a flavor.</v>

50
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>So there's a sort of simple version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Fear of contamination with washing</v>
<v Speaker 1>rituals.</v>

52
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>But OCD can get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of far out.</v>

54
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

55
00:03:13.901 --> 00:03:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I once worked with someone who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>California was contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what it meant was,</v>

57
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.490
<v Speaker 1>she couldn't have anything in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment that had the name California</v>

59
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>in it when mail a envelope had once</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived to her mailbox that had</v>

60
00:03:32.471 --> 00:03:36.130
<v Speaker 1>California on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her mailbox then became contaminated,</v>

61
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 1>or for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>intrusive harm befalling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

63
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I've had patients who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>worry that maybe they've driven over</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone as they drive and so they can't</v>

65
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>make it to work because they're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>around and around the intersection to</v>

66
00:03:50.831 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>make sure that they haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>run someone over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the harm can also be very,</v>

68
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>very abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not as concrete as that,</v>

69
00:03:57.941 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>but very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very abstract.</v>

70
00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:04:00.041 --> 00:04:00.970
<v Speaker 1>there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

72
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:02.620
<v Speaker 1>many versions of OCD.</v>

73
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>What we know is that when you do brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaging studies of people with OCD and</v>

74
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:15.640
<v Speaker 1>you compare their brain to the brain of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who don't have a CD,</v>

75
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.940
<v Speaker 1>that there is a hyperactive circuit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain that's been linked to a CD and</v>

76
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.020
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper hyperactivity in that circuit has</v>

78
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>been confirmed through animal studies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we don't think it's only that</v>

79
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:30.640
<v Speaker 1>circuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We think there are other circuits that</v>

80
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:35.641
<v Speaker 1>are likely involved as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a real clear neuroscience of</v>

81
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>behavior of obsessions and compulsions</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the brain get that way.</v>

83
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And here we know less about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we do know is that in some</v>

84
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in all families,</v>

85
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 1>ocd seems to run in those families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And certain genetic studies suggest that</v>

86
00:04:51.971 --> 00:04:55.150
<v Speaker 1>there is a familial contribution to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>CD.</v>

87
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in all cases,</v>

88
00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.310
<v Speaker 1>but exactly how that particular brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>circuit went awry in that particular</v>

89
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:05.890
<v Speaker 1>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know that we're working on it.</v>

90
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.163
<v Speaker 1>We don't know yet.</v>

91
00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
