1
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Generally worked on problems by looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at how can we solve the problem,</v>

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>but that's very much a fixed mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:19.581
<v Speaker 1>here's the problem and what can we do to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve it and technology advances in</v>

4
00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>technology have enabled us to do that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is that important?</v>

5
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Of course it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary,</v>

6
00:00:27.121 --> 00:00:32.121
<v Speaker 1>but it's not sufficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how can we solve problems in an</v>

7
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.730
<v Speaker 1>enduring way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an equitable way,</v>

8
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>in a way where nobody really loses</v>
<v Speaker 1>because too often we look at an issue</v>

9
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:47.961
<v Speaker 1>from a scarcity mindset,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankly we have an abundant planet</v>

10
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>and we have people with so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

11
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.950
<v Speaker 1>Can we engage that way differently?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's what this journey is about.</v>

12
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Awakening the space within me and within</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody else and it's about awakening</v>

13
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>and articulating what we see through our</v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern mind.</v>

14
00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about solving problems through that</v>

15
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.883
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

16
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.040
<v Speaker 1>It's not about fixing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's amazing is that people have</v>

17
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.650
<v Speaker 1>innate attributes worldwide and</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroscience and recent research shows</v>

18
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:32.931
<v Speaker 1>that what we can see is that human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have a sense of self,</v>

19
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>their own self worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we often,</v>

20
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about as dignity.</v>

21
00:01:39.421 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>So they have a sense of self worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether we are rich,</v>

22
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.030
<v Speaker 1>we are poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we follow any faith or whether</v>

23
00:01:48.031 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>we</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote for a particular political party.</v>

24
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.780
<v Speaker 1>This transcends all those divides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the social isms that we've created.</v>

25
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker 1>So basically the sense of self worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists and the sense of fairness exists</v>

26
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so very often people ask me,</v>

27
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.980
<v Speaker 1>what is it that there's so much inequity</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and you say that we have an</v>

28
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>innate sense of fairness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

29
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:21.951
<v Speaker 1>Oxfam did a study in the US and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>found that 92 percent of people actually</v>

30
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>believe that fairness is important.</v>

31
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>How great is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then people say,</v>

32
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:33.411
<v Speaker 1>how come there's so much inequity?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the inequities stems</v>

33
00:02:34.111 --> 00:02:39.111
<v Speaker 1>from our understanding of what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of that is promoted through</v>

34
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>creating demand for things we actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't need to a consumerism that's</v>

35
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:51.801
<v Speaker 1>extremely materialistic and this work is</v>
<v Speaker 1>about touching that space.</v>

36
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>And this work is also about the third</v>
<v Speaker 1>attribute that is compassion.</v>

37
00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:02.630
<v Speaker 1>What we know now is that people are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only functioning from their emotional</v>

38
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you know are neuroscientists are</v>

39
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.080
<v Speaker 1>physician will call our limbic system</v>
<v Speaker 1>and our emotional reactions.</v>

40
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Not that emotion is not important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important,</v>

41
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.990
<v Speaker 1>but we have a higher consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>activating that consciousness that</v>

42
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:25.750
<v Speaker 1>exists in everyone everywhere and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you many,</v>

43
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>many stories from around the world about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

44
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>When we activate that space of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher consciousness,</v>

45
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.010
<v Speaker 1>we bring to bear our innate sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>self,</v>

46
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 1>our sense of fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our compassion.</v>

47
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>So compassion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lovely Sanskrit.</v>

48
00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>Sanskrit is a based language of of India</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a Sanskrit word Karuna.</v>

49
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Karuna means my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my universal heart of love has broken</v>

50
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:03.571
<v Speaker 1>open and I'm called to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I cannot just bossed by what's not</v>

51
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:06.760
<v Speaker 1>working and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

52
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't serve my personal interest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I'm called to act.</v>

53
00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 1>So for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tapping into this spaces worldwide,</v>

54
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:20.350
<v Speaker 1>which is our inner capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sense of self,</v>

55
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.890
<v Speaker 1>our sense of fairness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our knowing of compassion.</v>

56
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>This has been the way we've created</v>
<v Speaker 1>change worldwide and it's worked.</v>

57
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.570
<v Speaker 1>We have results in every sector.</v>
