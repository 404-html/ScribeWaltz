1
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>On the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been great changes for people</v>

2
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>with intellectual disabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many countries have passed laws that</v>

3
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>open schools to children with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual disabilities.</v>

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to believe,</v>

5
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.350
<v Speaker 1>but just a few generations ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few decades ago,</v>

6
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>many children with disabilities were</v>
<v Speaker 1>never allowed to go to school.</v>

7
00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>School's were told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.130
<v Speaker 1>what I would tell parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

9
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>there is no place in this school for</v>
<v Speaker 1>your child.</v>

10
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So schools have opened up in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

11
00:00:35.111 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>Employers have begun to see a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>with an intellectual disability as</v>

12
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>someone who can contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who will be a loyal worker,</v>

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>someone who will be a reliable worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who will help create a positive</v>

14
00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.170
<v Speaker 1>environment at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So employers have begun a,</v>

15
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 1>the long process of opening their doors</v>
<v Speaker 1>of opportunity to people with</v>

16
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>intellectual disability and healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions have begun to study,</v>

17
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the various forms of intellectual</v>

18
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>disability and begun to respond with new</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of treatments,</v>

19
00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 1>new kinds of interventions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new kinds of therapies that not only</v>

20
00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:08.770
<v Speaker 1>help prevent those forms of intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>disability that are preventable,</v>

21
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe more importantly add to the</v>

22
00:01:11.201 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>quality of life of those who have an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual disability and want to</v>

23
00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:16.024
<v Speaker 1>contribute.</v>

24
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>So changes have been positive in most</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

25
00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.320
<v Speaker 1>Do we still have work to do last?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

26
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>All the positive changes in employment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and healthcare community living</v>

27
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.090
<v Speaker 1>education are still unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 1>isolated.</v>

28
00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>Examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most children with intellectual</v>

29
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:37.570
<v Speaker 1>disabilities never go to school more</v>
<v Speaker 1>than 90 percent,</v>

30
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:42.571
<v Speaker 1>never have a job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of them never have real</v>

31
00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:46.900
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few still ever get to play on a</v>

32
00:01:46.901 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>sports team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever get to join a community</v>

33
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever get to stand up in front of a crowd</v>

34
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what I've done.</v>

35
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Look how well I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give me a chance at a metal.</v>

36
00:01:57.101 --> 00:02:00.340
<v Speaker 1>Give me a chance at a cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a chance at success.</v>

37
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.410
<v Speaker 1>That experience is still tragically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:05.411 --> 00:02:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the rarest of experiences in the lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people with intellectual disabilities</v>

39
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>and their families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our job is to change that.</v>

40
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest barrier facing people with</v>

41
00:02:15.821 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>intellectual disabilities in almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>every country in the world is fear and</v>

42
00:02:19.601 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 1>misunderstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Negative attitudes.</v>

43
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people still believe that a child with</v>

44
00:02:25.541 --> 00:02:27.670
<v Speaker 1>an intellectual disability is somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesser.</v>

45
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they say to parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sorry,</v>

46
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.680
<v Speaker 1>you have such a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say to the child,</v>

47
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:37.300
<v Speaker 1>either in words or nonverbally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry that you're having to live</v>

48
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>such a tragic life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It couldn't be in many respects a</v>

49
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:44.950
<v Speaker 1>further thing from the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that bias translates into a lack of</v>

50
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>healthcare because people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bother giving healthcare to these</v>

51
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.800
<v Speaker 1>children?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It translates into a lack of special</v>

52
00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 1>educators because people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bother with special education?</v>

53
00:02:54.461 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 1>We have to train and educate other kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It translates into a lack of employment</v>

54
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.100
<v Speaker 1>because people think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why bother hiring this person?</v>

55
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>They'll never contributed anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest barrier is the negative</v>

56
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

57
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the result of negative attitudes are</v>

58
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>whole systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole social structures that too</v>

59
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>frequently say to a child with</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual disability,</v>

60
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you are not welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our job is to reverse those negative</v>

61
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>attitudes and create communities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

62
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>you are welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show me what you can do.</v>

63
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>You can contribute to the life of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

64
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>to the life of this country.</v>

65
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the CRC is sufficient as far as</v>

66
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a piece of paper.</v>

67
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a document.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a government document.</v>

68
00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>The real question is not is the wording</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 1>The real question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the implementation right?</v>

70
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Where are the people where the armies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens who will take the challenge of</v>

71
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the CRC and make it come to life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real urgency of now is not to have</v>

72
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>signatures on the bottom of the page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to have people in communities who</v>

73
00:03:58.331 --> 00:04:03.331
<v Speaker 1>are doing the work of overturning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attitudes and ensuring that the rights</v>

74
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>of the child with an intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>disability are protected.</v>

75
00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Where the teachers who will understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the CRC is an invitation to them to</v>

76
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:12.910
<v Speaker 1>open their classrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are the principles and the</v>

77
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>educators who will see in the CRC a</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge to them to make sure their</v>

78
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>school has special educators and other</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources where the mayors and the</v>

79
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 1>chiefs and the local officials who will</v>
<v Speaker 1>say to CRC as a challenge to my</v>

80
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:29.170
<v Speaker 1>community to become an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an icon of acceptance,</v>

81
00:04:29.171 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>to become the place where people want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>visit,</v>

82
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 1>to see what it means to be inclusive.</v>

83
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>This army where the parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the young people,</v>

84
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the religious leaders,</v>

85
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 1>the civic leaders who themselves through</v>
<v Speaker 1>every little fiber of the,</v>

86
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.760
<v Speaker 1>of the community can begin to weave in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a place for the person with</v>

87
00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 1>special needs in my church and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>synagogue in my temple,</v>

88
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>in my school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my institution,</v>

89
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>in my place of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my home,</v>

90
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.070
<v Speaker 1>on my playground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my park.</v>

91
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>When that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the CRC will no longer be on paper.</v>

92
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>It will be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will have come to life.</v>

93
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will be the measure of its success</v>

94
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>in the moment of celebration.</v>
