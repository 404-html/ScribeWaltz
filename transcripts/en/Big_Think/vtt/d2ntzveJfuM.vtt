1
00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.410
<v Speaker 1>It was alleged that the newspapers were</v>
<v Speaker 1>not aware of the large percentage of the</v>

2
00:00:09.511 --> 00:00:14.511
<v Speaker 1>population of American citizens were</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappy with the ruling establishment,</v>

3
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>did not feel their voices are being</v>
<v Speaker 1>heard,</v>

4
00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.800
<v Speaker 1>and they voted against what everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was was the leading candidate</v>

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.820
<v Speaker 1>and instead voted for this rank</v>
<v Speaker 1>outsider,</v>

6
00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>a very unpredictable and generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>unpopular person.</v>

7
00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Because businessman this egotist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this rakish character named Donald</v>

8
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought what was missing from the</v>

9
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:46.560
<v Speaker 1>newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think more than that from</v>

10
00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:49.440
<v Speaker 1>Americans in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who watched television,</v>

11
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>who read books to teach in universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are among the educated classes,</v>

12
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.450
<v Speaker 1>which go almost includes everybody these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

13
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>The reason I say that in my lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>born in 1932 and becoming a journalist</v>

14
00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 fifties and at the time I</v>
<v Speaker 1>became a journalist,</v>

15
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>the 19 fifties we journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it worked for the New York Times</v>

16
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and the Philadelphia Inquirer or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chicago Tribune,</v>

17
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>where generally the first of our family</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have gone to college.</v>

18
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And when I say college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not mean Harvard,</v>

19
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.361
<v Speaker 1>Yale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Princeton,</v>

20
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Stanford.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Brooklyn College or in my case,</v>

21
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the University of Alabama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were not going to the elite colleges.</v>

22
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.380
<v Speaker 1>If we went to college at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was we were considered scholars in</v>

23
00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 1>our family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we were,</v>

24
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>what we were not true today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what we in the Mid Twentieth Century</v>

25
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were outsiders.</v>

26
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>We journalists were of the outsider</v>
<v Speaker 1>class,</v>

27
00:01:46.111 --> 00:01:51.111
<v Speaker 1>whether we were Italian heritage is me</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Jewish or African American or</v>

28
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

29
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.640
<v Speaker 1>and we saw through the outside looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in with our nose pressed against the</v>

30
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:05.421
<v Speaker 1>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We looked inside at power and privilege</v>

31
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>at maneuverings within the political</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

32
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>at a poc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cracy,</v>

33
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.210
<v Speaker 1>at outright deceit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw all this and sometimes if we had</v>

34
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:18.450
<v Speaker 1>courage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we wrote about and we did have courage</v>

35
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.990
<v Speaker 1>because most of us had come from parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>or grandparents who had knew,</v>

36
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>who had firsthand knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>persecution and foreign countries who</v>

37
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.920
<v Speaker 1>came to this country on the run and</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought with them the spirit of</v>

38
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>unfairness and we as the inheritors of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their spirit when journalism.</v>

39
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.420
<v Speaker 1>We were the children of those period of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those people.</v>

40
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>We brought not cynicism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but skepticism of power and it was never</v>

41
00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>our ambition to be part of power because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were chroniclers of power.</v>

42
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>We were critics of power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were viewers of power.</v>

43
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>We were outsiders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>those days are long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long,</v>

45
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:04.490
<v Speaker 1>long gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:03:04.491 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>we have now 50 years beyond what I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

47
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>the group of journalists who go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same elite schools as the most</v>

48
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:20.191
<v Speaker 1>privileged people have power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama was a college professor,</v>

49
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Harvard Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was teaching while a president</v>

50
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:30.031
<v Speaker 1>for the two terms essentially teaching</v>
<v Speaker 1>class to the higher classes,</v>

51
00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.440
<v Speaker 1>including the journalism of his time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have this ranking foul mouth</v>

52
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.950
<v Speaker 1>guy with his oldest awful blonde hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming elected and the people in</v>

53
00:03:46.421 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh God,</v>

54
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.420
<v Speaker 1>it's so embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like they were so stunned is like</v>

55
00:03:52.421 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>having a.</v>

56
00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their world is shattered and have why</v>

57
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:59.320
<v Speaker 1>you're so shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so stupid?</v>

58
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't you realize that you join you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Journalists are so blind.</v>

59
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>You don't know as journalist anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>except being educated from the time</v>

60
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're privileged little kids.</v>

61
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even poor people,</v>

62
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>black people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hispanic,</v>

63
00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>still want to be like the privileged</v>
<v Speaker 1>white people and what I'm getting at,</v>

64
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and her long winded way is the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists have failed,</v>

65
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>were failed profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The pride that my generation took,</v>

66
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.020
<v Speaker 1>being strong as a force against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>powers of prerogative,</v>

67
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>powers of privilege doesn't exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

68
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The journalist now want to be part of</v>

69
00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>the power game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to get on Air Force One.</v>

70
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>They want to join trump at 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to have that dinner.</v>

71
00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>20 one with the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be clustered in Washington,</v>

72
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 1>which is the most decadent city.</v>

73
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's the most evil empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I were running Washington,</v>

74
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>boy do I sometimes have grandiose ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the night,</v>

75
00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>if I was already what I would get half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those reporters out of Washington,</v>

76
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>break up the Washington press corps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>send them all over to the state</v>

77
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:09.670
<v Speaker 1>capitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have 50 states,</v>

78
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>put two reporters in every state instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>of covering congress or the cabinet or</v>

79
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.890
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the people who are from these states</v>

80
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.850
<v Speaker 1>report the mood of the state's report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The feelings,</v>

81
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>the findings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personalities that are in parts of</v>

82
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:33.391
<v Speaker 1>America that are not and in the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>main street and main light,</v>

83
00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>and we tell our story not for the power</v>
<v Speaker 1>brokers that are clustered Washington,</v>

84
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>those privilege power and generally rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

85
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>but we're tell something about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results of law,</v>

86
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>the results of privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results of ignorance,</v>

87
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:49.120
<v Speaker 1>the results of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

88
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>of bad decisions and war would cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Injured.</v>

89
00:05:52.961 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Soldiers would cover the life of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of farmers,</v>

90
00:05:56.321 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>would cover a grease mechanic and a guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's some redneck sheriff somewhere.</v>

91
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:06.280
<v Speaker 1>And if we knew the America that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would not be surprised by such an</v>

92
00:06:06.861 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 1>election as we had and the aftermath of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama's eight years.</v>
