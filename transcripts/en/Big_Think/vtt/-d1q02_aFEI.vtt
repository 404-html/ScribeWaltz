1
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.780
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that came out of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

2
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 1>if you truly by the idea that this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way of thinking about the world,</v>

3
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 1>like the scientific method,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a way of dealing with the world as</v>

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.170
<v Speaker 1>a way of thinking about solving problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

5
00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Then you should be able to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>business problems with it.</v>

6
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.500
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things I started thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about a lot more as I wrote about my</v>

7
00:00:33.501 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>research was how would I take this</v>
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>

8
00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>this way of reasoning and apply it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>business setting,</v>

9
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.980
<v Speaker 1>like in a social setting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

10
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>So a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I walked into class one day and I asked</v>

11
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.730
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't I buy futures contracts in</v>

12
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Rwandan prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.160
<v Speaker 1>So why is it that when we try to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like poverty or a women's</v>

14
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>progress or a education b seemed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that we need to use a different</v>

15
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>set of tools that business.</v>

16
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.770
<v Speaker 1>So that was one of the questions I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I started thinking through,</v>

17
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would an expert entrepreneur</v>

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>actually tackled any of those problems?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I gave you the example of moment</v>

19
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.680
<v Speaker 1>with you this already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a great example of somebody who</v>

20
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>take it exactly like a lot of the expert</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs that I studied and ended</v>

21
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:33.890
<v Speaker 1>up actually solving a social problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with surveys to a reasonable extent.</v>

22
00:01:33.891 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot more work to be done.</v>

23
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 1>At least he showed the one way to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem.</v>

24
00:01:39.111 --> 00:01:44.111
<v Speaker 1>And for me it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a two problems in one in</v>

25
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:49.871
<v Speaker 1>the sense that it also lifts people out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of poverty and it helps women do it.</v>

26
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>It empowers women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I find that very,</v>

27
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 1>very close to my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

28
00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you start looking for people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have solve social problems and in a,</v>

29
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>in a reasonably big way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you find the same kind of thinking,</v>

30
00:02:06.141 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>then it begs the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.570
<v Speaker 1>as to why we would not use business</v>
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>

32
00:02:11.571 --> 00:02:14.120
<v Speaker 1>why would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't use entrepreneurial thinking to</v>

33
00:02:14.121 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>solve some of those problems.</v>

34
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>And that line of thought has led me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting problem that I want to</v>

35
00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 1>this post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is because a lot of</v>

36
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:28.760
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs in the social sector think</v>
<v Speaker 1>like entrepreneurs in the for profit</v>

37
00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somehow the funding part of it is so</v>

38
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.680
<v Speaker 1>different that it makes the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector problems very different and</v>

39
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things I want to think</v>

40
00:02:42.291 --> 00:02:47.240
<v Speaker 1>about is what would have to change the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way we fund problems in the social</v>

41
00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 1>so that entrepreneurial thinking can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do the kind of development that</v>

43
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:59.030
<v Speaker 1>has been made possible at the for profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector in places like India and China.</v>

44
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So that's one of the questions that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to leave people with to think</v>

45
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would it take to create something</v>

46
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>that is equally valid to all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different kinds of credit markets and</v>

47
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>innovative financial instruments that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>see in the for profit sector.</v>

48
00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>I know this is a really bad time to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about innovative financial instruments,</v>

49
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.640
<v Speaker 1>but I also think it's a great time for</v>
<v Speaker 1>that very same reason that the same</v>

50
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.890
<v Speaker 1>innovative a mindset that you have in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the financial secretary.</v>

51
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You could actually take it over to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social sector.</v>

52
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:38.311
<v Speaker 1>I think something interesting things can</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen and so I do want to give you just</v>

53
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:43.360
<v Speaker 1>one example or maybe two on that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to my heart and you can decide</v>

54
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.810
<v Speaker 1>what to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>one example I have is this company</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Looney Uhh,</v>

56
00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>which has come up with a venture capital</v>
<v Speaker 1>model for funding education in Latin</v>

57
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.610
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

58
00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>another uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrument that I'm looking at is a</v>

59
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>fixed income instrument to fund</v>
<v Speaker 1>education in Pakistan.</v>

60
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are education issues are kind of</v>

61
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:07.414
<v Speaker 1>close to my heart.</v>

62
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>What I want to talk about is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovations in funding that are</v>

63
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:20.641
<v Speaker 1>available in the for profit sector that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are not available in the social sector</v>

64
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>and not even innovations things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were innovations once upon a time,</v>

65
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:30.391
<v Speaker 1>but things that we take for granted now</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just efficient ways of funneling</v>

66
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 1>resources into particular companies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>matching up different investors with</v>

67
00:04:37.961 --> 00:04:40.240
<v Speaker 1>different companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

68
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>let's think about something like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 1>more fuel efficient cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>So one of the ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:54.691
<v Speaker 1>you think about how do you want to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about buying a fuel efficient car?</v>

72
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>You can check out all the different</v>
<v Speaker 1>models that are there and you can hear</v>

73
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>people pitch by the electric car is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much better than the hybrid or uh,</v>

74
00:05:03.881 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas would be even better or you</v>

75
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 1>can actually have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

76
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.270
<v Speaker 1>turn on CNBC or a on CNN or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology section or something like</v>

77
00:05:14.531 --> 00:05:17.980
<v Speaker 1>that and you and you can listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>different people pitch you different</v>

78
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>things and then you can take your pick.</v>

79
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>You can spend a little bit more time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some more analysis or research if you</v>

80
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.360
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can say,</v>

81
00:05:25.361 --> 00:05:30.280
<v Speaker 1>here's the kind of car I want to buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can also think through which,</v>

82
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.090
<v Speaker 1>which car company you want to invest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

83
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 1>But there's no channel that I can turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and here,</v>

84
00:05:37.241 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two guys from the Congo say,</v>

85
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to me about how they are going to</v>

86
00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>solve the illiteracy problem in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congo.</v>

87
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think through which one do I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to actually back and go home,</v>

88
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 1>do a little bit of research and a couple</v>
<v Speaker 1>of clicks on the computer and I send the</v>

89
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:55.094
<v Speaker 1>money to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

90
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 1>We never think about social sector</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems in the same way.</v>

91
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.920
<v Speaker 1>That's the kind of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

92
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>and let's say one of those two guys in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Congo as a really poor way of</v>

93
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:10.220
<v Speaker 1>solving the illiteracy problem in such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way that the problem's solved.</v>

94
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

95
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>it creates a financially self sustaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

96
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way we can just simply create</v>

97
00:06:17.661 --> 00:06:22.661
<v Speaker 1>a franchise of 1200 of those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools that spread all over Africa or</v>

98
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>we can important to Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't think about social sector</v>

99
00:06:27.651 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 1>problems though that way and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any of the channels that</v>

100
00:06:32.211 --> 00:06:37.211
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure that exists that allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs to not just build ventures</v>

101
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:43.571
<v Speaker 1>but to grow them and to spread them out</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to create variations through</v>

102
00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

103
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>So I allow a lot of those things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of us will recognize those market</v>

104
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.860
<v Speaker 1>They don't exist in the social world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really good smart people</v>

106
00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>reinvent the wheel all the time in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social sector.</v>

107
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:06.790
<v Speaker 1>So my question really is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>essence of entrepreneurial thinking</v>

108
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:12.370
<v Speaker 1>exists on the side of entrepreneurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>building ventures in the social sector,</v>

109
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to be very much lacking on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funding side and that's where I</v>

110
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:21.830
<v Speaker 1>think I would like to do some work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of my colleagues and I are</v>

111
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.010
<v Speaker 1>beginning to work on it and we call</v>
<v Speaker 1>those markets in here.</v>

112
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Would hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to mention that because I</v>

113
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:32.741
<v Speaker 1>want to leave like a everything that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>have talked about here on a what to do</v>

114
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:38.081
<v Speaker 1>next problem and I think for those of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in innovative ideas in</v>

115
00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:44.141
<v Speaker 1>business and especially a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the logic of entrepreneurs that is going</v>

<v Speaker 1>through how do we bring entrepreneurial</v>

118
00:07:50.511 --> 00:07:52.940

00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:05.070
<v Speaker 1>opportunities on the funding side for</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs to get in there.</v>

123
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
