00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I answer this like completely honest,</v>

2
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>like it's just going to be like some</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corny Shit,</v>

3
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be like,</v>

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm sincerely interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>and how the mind works and in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 1>kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal,</v>

8
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>timeless curiosities that man has always</v>
<v Speaker 1>had.</v>

9
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:46.170
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we here?</v>

10
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this all about?</v>

11
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm really kind of depressing</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiosities that,</v>

12
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me have been answered,</v>

13
00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

14
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploring psychedelics.</v>

15
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

16
00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 1>you can decide if you want to edit all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this however it went.</v>

17
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>But I grow my own mushrooms and develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with a lot of different</v>

18
00:01:20.561 --> 00:01:25.561
<v Speaker 1>plants in order to find some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>insight and answers</v>

19
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.010
<v Speaker 1>to those curiosities about why we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>here and what's this all about.</v>

20
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.850
<v Speaker 1>And I don't do drugs recreationally at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all and I don't,</v>

21
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trip out and enjoy the world here.</v>

22
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>What I do is go in to my own mind as</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply as possible to find</v>

23
00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>answers and then come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know what to do.</v>

24
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And I know that sounds incredibly corny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the answer.</v>

25
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why,</v>

26
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

27
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to create,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work that up.</v>

28
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That reflects that psychedelic</v>

29
00:02:26.351 --> 00:02:29.200
<v Speaker 1>experience through kind of the fractal</v>
<v Speaker 1>based,</v>

30
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction of the picture plane.</v>

31
00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.400
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I've learned is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>create my own world and share that</v>
<v Speaker 1>with as many people as possible,</v>

34
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what makes me unique and then</v>

35
00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.150
<v Speaker 1>share that and inspire others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe answer is inspired,</v>

36
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desire to inspire others inspires,</v>

37
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>inspires me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

38
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:09.784
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

39
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the aesthetics are almost kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

41
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 1>a superficial reflection of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience or experiences.</v>

42
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are,</v>

43
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>to some degree that aesthetic Trojan</v>
<v Speaker 1>horse,</v>

44
00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>the kind of psychedelic colors and</v>
<v Speaker 1>compositions.</v>

46
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

47
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think are,</v>

48
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:37.381
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

49
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>are beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the real message.</v>

50
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>That's not the real content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just the,</v>

51
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>the form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.740
<v Speaker 1>that's just the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

53
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beauty that brings you in,</v>

54
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.624
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

55
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
