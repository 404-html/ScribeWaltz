1
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm tempted to say smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative people have no particularly</v>

2
00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 1>different set of character traits than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of us,</v>

3
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>except for being smart and creative and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those being character traits.</v>

4
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And then on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a biography of Richard Fineman</v>

5
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>and a biography if Isaac Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there are two great scientific</v>

6
00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:32.001
<v Speaker 1>geniuses whose characters were in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>superficial ways,</v>

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 1>completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton was solitary,</v>

8
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>antisocial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think unpleasant.</v>

9
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm bitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fought with his friends as much as with</v>

10
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:54.690
<v Speaker 1>his enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Fineman was gregarious,</v>

11
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great dancer,</v>

12
00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loved women.</v>

13
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Isaac Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

14
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:05.190
<v Speaker 1>never had sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Fineman I believe had plenty.</v>

15
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can't generalize there.</v>

16
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were both,</v>

17
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.460
<v Speaker 1>as I tried to get in their heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand their minds,</v>

18
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:19.080
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nature of their genius.</v>

19
00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>I sort of felt I was seeing things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had in common and,</v>

20
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and they were things that had to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>aloneness.</v>

21
00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Newton was much more obviously alone</v>

22
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>than fineman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fineman didn't particularly work</v>

23
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:35.850
<v Speaker 1>well with others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

24
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>he was known as a great teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't a great teacher.</v>

25
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think one on one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was a great lecturer.</v>

26
00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a great communicator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when it came time to make the great</v>

27
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>discoveries of science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was alone in his head.</v>

28
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm talking to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I say he,</v>

29
00:01:56.551 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean both fineman and Newton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this applies also I think to the</v>

30
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>geniuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.410
<v Speaker 1>that I write about in the information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles Babbage,</v>

32
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Alan Turing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ada Byron,</v>

33
00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they all had the ability to concentrate</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a sort of intensity that is</v>

34
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>hard for mortals like me to grasp a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

35
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passion,</v>

36
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.580
<v Speaker 1>passion for abstraction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

37
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't lend itself to</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy communication.</v>

38
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
