1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Never read on your friends and always</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep your mouth shut.</v>

2
00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.250
<v Speaker 1>If you elevate loyalty over trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got a situation like barry bonds,</v>

3
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>personal trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greg Anderson.</v>

4
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.750
<v Speaker 1>He was initially questioned about</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether he gave steroids,</v>

5
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:17.440
<v Speaker 1>are injected barry bonds with steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He law and he said he never did.</v>

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Then when called before the grand jury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he refused to testify.</v>

7
00:00:20.411 --> 00:00:23.710
<v Speaker 1>He was held in contempt of court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was put in jail on multiple occasions</v>

8
00:00:23.711 --> 00:00:26.770
<v Speaker 1>for remaining silent and one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those occasions when he was</v>

9
00:00:26.771 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>released from jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the inmates gathered around and gave</v>

10
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>him a standing ovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:31.331 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 1>this to me pretty much says it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty over truth means this is the</v>

12
00:00:35.921 --> 00:00:39.190
<v Speaker 1>code of the prison yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the code of organized crime.</v>

13
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>This is the code of the Mafia.</v>

14
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.613
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

15
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>they weren't going to prosecute use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>steroids,</v>

16
00:00:47.051 --> 00:00:49.210
<v Speaker 1>but they wanted to nail this guy for</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributing it.</v>

17
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 1>So Barry bonds was called before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>grand jury.</v>

18
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>He had been given immunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing he could be prosecuted</v>

19
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>for perjury or false statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took the oath.</v>

20
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>They then ask him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did you use steroids?</v>

21
00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.950
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Were you ever injected with steroids?</v>

22
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lied repeatedly to the grand jury.</v>

23
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Why did it take eight years from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that barry bonds allegedly lodge to</v>

24
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>the grand jury until he was actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried for the case?</v>

25
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.410
<v Speaker 1>It was because everyone was long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>

26
00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:20.320
<v Speaker 1>it was worldclass lying on a massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>

27
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.620
<v Speaker 1>and all the prosecutors could do was</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate people for perjury where</v>

28
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't get to the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>

29
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loyalty to one's employer.</v>

30
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Loyalty to a benefactor is a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful countervailing force.</v>

31
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.110
<v Speaker 1>There must be some kind of punishment</v>
<v Speaker 1>and accountability in an ancient Rome.</v>

32
00:01:38.111 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 1>People were put to death in medieval</v>
<v Speaker 1>England.</v>

33
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>They had their tongues cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we need to go to,</v>

34
00:01:44.051 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 1>is that barbaric?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extreme,</v>

35
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>but there must be visible accountability</v>
<v Speaker 1>for breaking the law.</v>

36
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
