<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 2>curiosity has been often referred to as</v>
<v Speaker 2>closing a knowledge gap and this goes</v>

3
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 2>back to Berlin's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Work,</v>

4
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 2>goes back to a lot of work being done by</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lippman and his colleagues presently</v>

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 2>would distinguish between two forms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>curiosity,</v>

6
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>epistemic curiosity and knowledge gap,</v>

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 2>curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that probation they call it.</v>

8
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.300
<v Speaker 2>The reason that they call it deprivation</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because that is has been an argument</v>

9
00:00:34.301 --> 00:00:38.200
<v Speaker 2>that if you are curious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a certain kind of negative</v>

10
00:00:38.201 --> 00:00:43.201
<v Speaker 2>feeling that you experienced before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your curiosity is satisfied and once you</v>

11
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:48.751
<v Speaker 2>have this answer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you feel a relief and a positive feeling</v>

12
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:54.280
<v Speaker 2>comes over you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We argued that if you are interested and</v>

13
00:00:54.281 --> 00:00:59.281
<v Speaker 2>you are searching for more information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a rewarding experience and you</v>

14
00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:04.321
<v Speaker 2>do not necessarily or you're unlikely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an adversity feeling except you can</v>

15
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 2>have negative feelings develop because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a problem in your search,</v>

16
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.460
<v Speaker 2>but that's different than trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>close the knowledge gap.</v>

17
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.060
<v Speaker 2>The way that I can best demonstrate you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how we consider curiosity and interest</v>

18
00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 2>to be different is by telling you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about when you read a detective</v>

19
00:01:26.321 --> 00:01:28.900
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you read a detective story,</v>

20
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:33.790
<v Speaker 2>the minute you find out that who</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually is the murderer,</v>

21
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.910
<v Speaker 2>you might not even want to finish your</v>
<v Speaker 2>book and compare that to reading glad,</v>

22
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 2>say Harry Potter or some really well</v>
<v Speaker 2>constructed book that you are not simply</v>

23
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 2>trying to find out a knowledge gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are interested in many of the</v>

24
00:01:47.531 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 2>characters who are interested in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas,</v>

25
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you are interested in the relationships</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you will keep on reading that book.</v>

26
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Not only is the length of time different</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the aversion different,</v>

27
00:01:58.511 --> 00:02:03.511
<v Speaker 2>but there are also the purpose is is</v>
<v Speaker 2>different like when you are interested</v>

28
00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are searching for a lot of</v>

29
00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:09.430
<v Speaker 2>information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just a specific information to close</v>

30
00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:10.420
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge gap.</v>

31
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Now there are some</v>
<v Speaker 2>unanswered issues about this.</v>

32
00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens if you have interest in a</v>

33
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.580
<v Speaker 2>content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is a knowledge gap that you're</v>

34
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.990
<v Speaker 2>closing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that now different from just being</v>

35
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:29.880
<v Speaker 2>curious and we argued that it is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

36
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.050
<v Speaker 2>at a bridge expert who loves playing</v>
<v Speaker 2>bridge,</v>

37
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 2>he is reading a book with many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many puzzles.</v>

38
00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solving beach hands.</v>

39
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 2>He goes and solves and knowledge gap and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then continuous going onto other</v>

40
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other puzzles,</v>

41
00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.940
<v Speaker 2>because he has that individual interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the content that propels him to go on</v>

42
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 2>for further activity.</v>
