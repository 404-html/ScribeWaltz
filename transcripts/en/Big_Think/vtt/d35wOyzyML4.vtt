1
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>per value value,</v>

2
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.700
<v Speaker 2>valuing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying attention and valuing the moment</v>

3
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker 2>and realizing that the present is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most elusive of all,</v>

4
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you know,</v>

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.490
<v Speaker 2>you can stabilize the past because there</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

6
00:00:31.491 --> 00:00:35.840
<v Speaker 2>Or you can at least stabilize instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>memories and crawl up the past.</v>

7
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>You can stabilize the future and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though you don't know it,</v>

8
00:00:39.021 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 2>you can project a future and you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>dream about it.</v>

9
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you can just think of it as an object</v>

10
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 2>of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the president is always disappearing</v>

11
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

12
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to slow down this flood</v>
<v Speaker 2>of time through a,</v>

13
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a kind of little meditation or just</v>

14
00:00:59.211 --> 00:01:01.040
<v Speaker 2>looking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopping and looking.</v>

15
00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the thing I value and</v>

16
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 2>that's what I probably am in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 2>a half percent of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

18
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>but the poetry tries to get into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it does.</v>

19
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tries to get into that state and</v>

20
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 2>arrest one of those moments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this kind of crackpot analogy,</v>

21
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 2>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

22
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.580
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

23
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is old atomic theory,</v>

24
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.980
<v Speaker 2>but if you took an you've take an Adam</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you smash it,</v>

25
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter is composed of atoms and he</v>

27
00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:38.960
<v Speaker 2>smashed one and it releases this</v>
<v Speaker 2>staggering amount of energy.</v>

28
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Time is composed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of Adam's but of moments.</v>

29
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 2>And if you smash a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is also this amazing release.</v>

30
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 2>And the way to smash a moment is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>with a cyclotron.</v>

31
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but through attention you smash your out</v>

32
00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.940
<v Speaker 2>by fixing it in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

33
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot of poetry.</v>

34
00:02:02.481 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 2>Haiku was a very good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most Little Haiku poems are just</v>

35
00:02:07.311 --> 00:02:12.311
<v Speaker 2>interested in isolating a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that moment becomes a tiny thing and</v>

36
00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 2>suddenly it becomes everything at once.</v>

37
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>
<v Speaker 1>recovering Catholic.</v>

38
00:02:22.221 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 1>I went to it to a</v>

39
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 2>jesuit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to,</v>

40
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to Catholic school from the first</v>

41
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:31.440
<v Speaker 2>grade right through college,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the full metal jacket of Catholic</v>

42
00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.950
<v Speaker 2>education when I got to graduate school</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the first time I'd been in a</v>

43
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.190
<v Speaker 2>classroom with a female since the eighth</v>
<v Speaker 2>grade.</v>

44
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.180
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure of the effect of that on</v>

45
00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:43.014
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.941
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

47
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have,</v>

48
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have all the imagery of Catholicism</v>

49
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 2>that's still very vivid and vibrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

50
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.430
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

51
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.570
<v Speaker 2>the faith is something else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a little,</v>

52
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult in a way to maintain</v>
<v Speaker 2>a connection to a church that is so full</v>

53
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.404
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

54
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>flaws and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hierarchical.</v>

55
00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:11.390
<v Speaker 2>The structured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.480
<v Speaker 2>church,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

57
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.600
<v Speaker 2>Martin Sheen I think summed it up best</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he said that.</v>

58
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in God,</v>

59
00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.990
<v Speaker 2>but I believe that Mary was his mother.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

60
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.751
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

61
00:03:25.751 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

62
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.670
<v Speaker 2>you can lose contact with the theology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can never lose contact with the,</v>

63
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>the iconography,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imagery,</v>

64
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 1>dre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decency.</v>

65
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

66
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>courtesy is very much a priority,</v>

67
00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.510
<v Speaker 2>but I think I keep going back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wordsworth,</v>

68
00:03:56.511 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>

69
00:03:57.351 --> 00:04:00.590
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's suggested are the better part of</v>

70
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:02.780
<v Speaker 2>our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sort of thread that connects our</v>

71
00:04:02.781 --> 00:04:07.781
<v Speaker 2>lives is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is composed of what he calls a little</v>

72
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:12.230
<v Speaker 2>nameless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unremembered acts of kindness and of</v>

73
00:04:12.231 --> 00:04:15.440
<v Speaker 2>love.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's very important that these acts</v>

74
00:04:15.441 --> 00:04:17.090
<v Speaker 2>are unremembered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

75
00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.880
<v Speaker 2>if you do something consciously for</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone and remember it,</v>

76
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.841
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

77
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an endowment is a nice thing to do</v>

78
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:25.430
<v Speaker 2>and get your name on the gymnasium or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the library.</v>

79
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one kind of contribution,</v>

80
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 2>but I'm equally as important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to t to stitch your days</v>

81
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:36.650
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

82
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:40.370
<v Speaker 2>is just a kind of moving through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world with the kind of courtesy.</v>

83
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

84
00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I think that leads to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems almost trivial in terms of</v>

85
00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:48.620
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a point of etiquette,</v>

86
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.820
<v Speaker 2>but I think courtesy leads to a much</v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger things,</v>

87
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.080
<v Speaker 2>but you have to start with</v>

88
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>tiny dress.</v>
