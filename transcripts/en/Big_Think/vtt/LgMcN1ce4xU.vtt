00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Born</v>
<v Speaker 1>and growing up in New York City,</v>

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>automatically you have first a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>uberous</v>

3
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.850
<v Speaker 2>by definition because there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond New York City.</v>

4
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 2>Though I have traveled the world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are great cities,</v>

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.240
<v Speaker 2>but I think most important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the diversity of New York City,</v>

6
00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.000
<v Speaker 2>the diversity of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity of ideas,</v>

7
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>diversity of foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>music experiences automatically forces a</v>

8
00:00:29.351 --> 00:00:31.850
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of your boundaries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.100
<v Speaker 2>to come down because you meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meet people and have these experiences</v>

10
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 2>that are so different from whatever</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences you grew up.</v>

11
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:43.330
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in a traditional Jewish home,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wound up going to Columbia University,</v>

12
00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.580
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and literally all of a sudden,</v>

13
00:00:45.581 --> 00:00:49.110
<v Speaker 2>an entire world was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was living on 116th street and,</v>

14
00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.990
<v Speaker 2>and there were more types of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One could have in a five,</v>

15
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven block radius,</v>

16
00:00:54.611 --> 00:00:57.910
<v Speaker 2>then one could have in whole other</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities in the world.</v>

17
00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:00.580
<v Speaker 2>And so yet alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the different kinds of people in the</v>

18
00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>different sounds and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the different smells.</v>

19
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think what that does is it opens</v>

20
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

21
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

22
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
