1
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Philanthropic investor and I invest</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily in</v>

2
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 2>early childhood education and services.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

3
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 2>spent quite a bit of time and money on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subject of early literacy.</v>

4
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I did in my business career,</v>

5
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 2>I would describe as I applied systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>solutions to large business problems.</v>

6
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.220
<v Speaker 2>I was in the early days of Federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>Express building.</v>

7
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 2>I was the chief information officer back</v>
<v Speaker 2>then after I had left IBM and other</v>

8
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:42.930
<v Speaker 2>private businesses and I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did that for a while,</v>

9
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 2>building the worldwide trade shipping</v>
<v Speaker 2>tracking system.</v>

10
00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:50.250
<v Speaker 2>And then I was chief operating officer</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Federal Express for about 10 years,</v>

11
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>implementing lots of systems,</v>

12
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:56.640
<v Speaker 2>aviation systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer systems.</v>

13
00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.320
<v Speaker 2>So I learned a great deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>from that experience.</v>

14
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Then I went and ran a largest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the largest solar company in the</v>

15
00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and mccaw cellular out of Seattle.</v>

16
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sold that to a t and t and became</v>

<v Speaker 2>chief executive officer of at and t</v>
<v Speaker 2>wireless back in the early nineties.</v>

18
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I left that at the behest of</v>

19
00:01:18.991 --> 00:01:22.320
<v Speaker 2>some people who are now great friends of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mine to go with a little startup.</v>

20
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I figured one more bite at the apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I went down to Palo Alto and mountain</v>

21
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:31.380
<v Speaker 2>view California and became the chief</v>

<v Speaker 2>called netscape communications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we taught the world how to use the</v>

23
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Internet with the browser.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we sold that to aol in</v>
