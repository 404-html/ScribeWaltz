00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I think there is clearly a room at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point for a third party because the</v>

2
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.660
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since they've taken control of Congress,</v>

3
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.750
<v Speaker 1>have done very little to build public</v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence.</v>

4
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 1>The public approval ratings of Congress</v>
<v Speaker 1>are as low now as they were before the</v>

5
00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.850
<v Speaker 1>2006 election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Republicans are carrying the burden</v>

6
00:00:30.851 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>of the Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's wide open for an</v>

7
00:00:34.151 --> 00:00:36.190
<v Speaker 1>independent or third party candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See.</v>
