1
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.960
<v Speaker 1>One of the problems that we always have</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the kind of culture,</v>

2
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which save children involved,</v>

3
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.200
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to replicate in our current,</v>

4
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our current culture.</v>

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So I always say sort of ideally what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have is a six to one ratio where</v>

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:26.580
<v Speaker 1>you could have six grownups taking care</v>
<v Speaker 1>of each child.</v>

7
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I mean maybe a better way of putting</v>

8
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.910
<v Speaker 1>it is that you'd have a community of</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents,</v>

9
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>you'd have a community of caregivers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The children are there as part of that</v>

10
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if anybody is sitting there</v>

11
00:00:38.611 --> 00:00:41.700
<v Speaker 1>and doing a bunch of special things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just directed at the child.</v>

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>So the vision that we have from school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's someone who's got this special</v>

13
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of shaping education of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the child is the vision that is often</v>

14
00:00:50.461 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>imported into being a parent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's some special set of things</v>

15
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

16
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>flashcards or video or something other</v>

17
00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>than what you would normally do.</v>

18
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing that you are supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do to educate the child.</v>

19
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>And what the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the research shows is that children are</v>

20
00:01:07.411 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>learning from just observing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in the everyday thing was</v>

21
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>that people are doing in an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>subtle and powerful way.</v>

22
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 1>So all the conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the irony is that the unconscious</v>

23
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>things that you do when you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're interacting with children</v>

24
00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.130
<v Speaker 1>are much more likely to shape and affect</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they think then any of the</v>

25
00:01:26.131 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 1>things that you actually consciously</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide to do.</v>

26
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we have some lovely models</v>

27
00:01:30.841 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>for the way that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

28
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my personal favorite is cooking.</v>

29
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So my grandchildren come in and cook</v>
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>

30
00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Children love cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they love being involved in,</v>

31
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing that seems more</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting to them.</v>

32
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Then an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's actually trying to do something,</v>

33
00:01:47.581 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>actually trying to bring something about</v>
<v Speaker 1>and integrating them into that work.</v>

34
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.510
<v Speaker 1>So in a sense in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the village,</v>

35
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 1>the line between here's work and here's</v>
<v Speaker 1>children just wasn't there.</v>

36
00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is what do we do now to</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to,</v>

37
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when that's no longer true,</v>

38
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.050
<v Speaker 1>we are no longer growing up in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>

39
00:02:07.051 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>What can we do now to kind of recreate</v>
<v Speaker 1>that situation?</v>

40
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.190
<v Speaker 1>And I think the best preschools</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially recreate that village for</v>

41
00:02:14.191 --> 00:02:16.770
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what they do is put children in a</v>

42
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>context with a lot of adults who really</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about them,</v>

43
00:02:20.581 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are warm,</v>

44
00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>who were supportive and lots of stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them to play with.</v>

45
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing,</v>

46
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>another thing I say sometimes if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>really wanted to know what children,</v>

47
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>preschool children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>young children need to thrive.</v>

48
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:34.500
<v Speaker 1>They need mud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock and relatives.</v>

49
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And those are things that are in sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>short supply.</v>

50
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>But we can try and say a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good preschool to replace the mud,</v>

51
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock and relatives with,</v>

52
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good teachers and cocoons and</v>

53
00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>caterpillars and sandboxes.</v>

54
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.560
<v Speaker 1>But that's much more what young children</v>
<v Speaker 1>are learning for.</v>

55
00:02:52.561 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Then all the kind of very scholastic</v>
<v Speaker 1>academic activities that parents feel as</v>

56
00:02:57.481 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>if they need to engage in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that also makes life as a</v>

57
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:04.540
<v Speaker 1>working parent easier than if you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have one job and then you have</v>

58
00:03:04.541 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>another job to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

59
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>you have a job and then you have this</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

60
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.160
<v Speaker 1>This kind of a form of love that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have with these children that you're</v>

61
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>engaged in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing as work.</v>

62
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.160
<v Speaker 1>Part of the trouble in our culture in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our society is that we measure</v>

63
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We treat everything as if it's either a</v>

64
00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>kind of production or a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>

65
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 1>So from that perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either having children is an extremely</v>

66
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:36.610
<v Speaker 1>badly paid job or else it's an extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive luxury.</v>

67
00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and caregiving for children and for</v>

68
00:03:40.211 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>people in general just isn't a kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>production or a kind of consumption.</v>

69
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>It's its own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a deep,</v>

70
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 1>important part of being human beings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we make these profound commitments</v>

71
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We care about those people.</v>

72
00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>We do what we can to let those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>thrive on their own terms and in their</v>

73
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>own way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a deep thing that we do</v>

74
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>specifically about children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a part of our relationships</v>

75
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>with spouses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of our relationships with</v>

76
00:04:09.701 --> 00:04:11.320
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our parents when they get older and we</v>

77
00:04:11.321 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>have to take care of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that's kind of</v>

78
00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>invisible in our culture at large</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it doesn't fit into the</v>

79
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>production bucket or the consumption</v>
<v Speaker 1>bucket.</v>

80
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>One way to think about it is instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about parenting,</v>

81
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>we should be thinking about being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>parent.</v>

82
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.570
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting that we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:04:28.571 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 1>we don't wive our husbands and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>friend our friends and we don't child</v>

84
00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:33.814
<v Speaker 1>our parents.</v>

85
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>We wouldn't measure the quality of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those relationships by saying,</v>

86
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see,</v>

87
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:40.870
<v Speaker 1>is my husband actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

88
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>has he achieved his benchmarks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he better than he was,</v>

89
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I married him.</v>

90
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.540
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you work at relationships,</v>

91
00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 1>you put time and energy into them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think of them as in this</v>

92
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 1>kind of shaping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

93
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 1>in this kind of shaping process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that makes</v>

94
00:04:58.571 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>caregiving so interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much more interesting than it is on</v>

95
00:05:02.081 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>the parenting model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is these deep tensions,</v>

96
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:10.231
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of paradoxes that come in</v>
<v Speaker 1>caregiving where we have to go from</v>

97
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>taking care of the most dependent</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature we know of a human baby who</v>

98
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>completely requires us to make decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them too,</v>

99
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.210
<v Speaker 1>to keep them alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the outcome of all that is to try to</v>

100
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>create an adult who's completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent of us,</v>

101
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.390
<v Speaker 1>who's completely autonomous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who can make decisions,</v>

102
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 1>including making terrible decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>independently of us.</v>

103
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.480
<v Speaker 1>In some sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your children don't have the</v>

104
00:05:34.481 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>potential to fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you haven't succeeded as a parent.</v>

105
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>Because what you want to do as a parent</v>
<v Speaker 1>is make someone who's independent and</v>

106
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:48.031
<v Speaker 1>autonomous enough so they can take risks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and taking risks means the possibility</v>

107
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>of failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really different,</v>

108
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that's a different kind of activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

109
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>than almost any other kind of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>

110
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's deep and profound and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big reason that human beings have been</v>

111
00:05:59.711 --> 00:06:01.420
<v Speaker 1>able to succeed as well as they have.</v>
