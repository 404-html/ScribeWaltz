00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 2>well I think more than anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he has been very instrumental in</v>

3
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 2>developing just a sense of perspective</v>
<v Speaker 2>and balance,</v>

4
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 2>so as hard driving as he is and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no entrepreneurs who are</v>

5
00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 2>successful who are not hard driving and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he would admit that,</v>

6
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gave up basically having and raising</v>

7
00:00:32.251 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 2>a family to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

8
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>make playboy the success that it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

9
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:41.160
<v Speaker 2>I think he has the right kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective on life as to what the truly</v>

10
00:00:41.161 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 2>important things are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably the best lesson that</v>

11
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 2>you can actually give,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly your children.</v>
