00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.060
<v Speaker 1>If I could rework the entire business</v>
<v Speaker 1>model of Google,</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>I would get google to charge for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>search engine.</v>

3
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 1>I think it's an outstanding product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I acknowledge that.</v>

4
00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll say it publicly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it all the time too much.</v>

5
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a google account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very careful about that.</v>

6
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a gmail account and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign into google when I use the google</v>

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Google still knows me because I'm</v>

8
00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>really only on one or two computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they're watching,</v>

9
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will,</v>

10
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will know.</v>

11
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>A Google of course is always watching.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but the way to solve that is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>google,</v>

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.050
<v Speaker 1>the google search,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the google or the Google products are</v>

14
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:42.740
<v Speaker 1>free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that they have to read that</v>

15
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.820
<v Speaker 1>their revenue is derived from</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising.</v>

16
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 1>The alternative would be to charge me</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10 a month,</v>

17
00:00:48.241 --> 00:00:51.090
<v Speaker 1>say for all I can eat on the Google</v>
<v Speaker 1>search.</v>

18
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>And in exchange for that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say,</v>

19
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>we will promise never to look at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
<v Speaker 1>there'd be no cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no ways that they can survey what we're</v>

21
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would do away with themselves as a</v>

22
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:07.560
<v Speaker 1>big data company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same is true of facebook.</v>

23
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a facebook account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because facebook's or bad product in</v>

24
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:12.840
<v Speaker 1>some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's creepy,</v>

25
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.430
<v Speaker 1>but only because of that data practices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the facebook product was offered for</v>

26
00:01:17.431 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>10 or $15 a month or whatever the price</v>
<v Speaker 1>was like spotify is,</v>

27
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>it would be a much more attractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

28
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:27.690
<v Speaker 1>So I think that that is the challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the only person to think in</v>

29
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:29.850
<v Speaker 1>these terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethan Zimmerman,</v>

30
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is a fellow at the Berkman Center</v>

31
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:38.151
<v Speaker 1>and one of the most articulate sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelists for the Internet,</v>

32
00:01:38.581 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>at least at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>argues now that the free business model</v>

33
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:47.361
<v Speaker 1>was the original sin of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think Ethan's choice of Biblical</v>

34
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>language is appropriate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't original sin,</v>

35
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>it's corrupted everything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to see Google charge for their</v>

36
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>services and I think that they could</v>
<v Speaker 1>still be an incredibly viable company</v>

37
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong with paying with stuff?</v>

38
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before this interview,</v>

39
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I paid for my lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid for my taxi cab.</v>

40
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I didn't exchange my data for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That economy has worked well for</v>

41
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This new economy is creepy.</v>

42
00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>It's corrupted by the original sin of</v>
<v Speaker 1>swapping wonderful technology for data.</v>
