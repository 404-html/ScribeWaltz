00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.510
<v Speaker 1>To war</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>when I was listening to a talk earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

3
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:11.270
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

4
00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about lifting a Edr men out of</v>

5
00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>MDA and placing them somewhere else,</v>

6
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

7
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 2>without destroying the whole country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean a way of ways of neutralizing</v>

9
00:00:24.361 --> 00:00:26.370
<v Speaker 2>dictators that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

10
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.530
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

11
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 2>less or that are more humane and less</v>
<v Speaker 2>destructive than just an all out war on</v>

12
00:00:33.151 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.580
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm a leader that would have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>more inventive sense of strategies</v>

14
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 2>because we need some new paradigm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 2>war is sort of an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be.</v>

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 2>We should be over that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 2>that old paradigm of just throwing our</v>
<v Speaker 2>youngest people into this.</v>

18
00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>The face of danger.</v>
