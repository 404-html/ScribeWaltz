00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.790
<v Speaker 2>when I was in the Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have dinner every night because</v>

3
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a family and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were other members of Congress who</v>

4
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>didn't have their families there and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>went out and had dinner.</v>

5
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Today I'm told it's a rarity to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are of a different parties</v>

6
00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 2>that is to say Democrats having dinner</v>
<v Speaker 2>with Republicans and vice versa.</v>

7
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's very,</v>

8
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.990
<v Speaker 2>very bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the idea that politics have taken</v>

9
00:00:46.991 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 2>such hold that it bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>friendships.</v>

10
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 2>It's worse today than it was then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the reason is very simple.</v>

11
00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.960
<v Speaker 2>We were then the only city asking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>special help that I can recall from the</v>

12
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 2>congress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

13
00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 2>from the state legislature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas today,</v>

14
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.010
<v Speaker 2>almost every city in America has the</v>
<v Speaker 2>financial problems that we do on a</v>

15
00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:21.030
<v Speaker 2>lesser scale or something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be on a higher scale.</v>

16
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.330
<v Speaker 2>So I believe that the current mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mike Bloomberg,</v>

17
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 2>was doing a magnificent job as problems</v>
<v Speaker 2>that were greater than mine.</v>
