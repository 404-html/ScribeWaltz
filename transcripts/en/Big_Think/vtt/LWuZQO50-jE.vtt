1
00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well</v>

2
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what you describe as big</v>
<v Speaker 1>media is Google big media now.</v>

3
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're worth more than most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other media companies.</v>

4
00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>There was a period of time when most of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cable companies,</v>

5
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:25.310
<v Speaker 1>they were worth more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in Wall Street market cap terms</v>

6
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 1>and then the broadcast networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems in media that no one ever</v>

7
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Speaker 1>really goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when something new comes out</v>

8
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

9
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.231
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

10
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV's going to kill radio and then cable</v>

11
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>TV is going to kill tv and you know this</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that,</v>

12
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.830
<v Speaker 1>or the other thing is going to always</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill something off.</v>

13
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:50.831
<v Speaker 1>Somehow everybody moves over on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bench and nothing really goes away.</v>

14
00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean some formats might go away like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eight track or the cassette or the</v>

15
00:00:55.161 --> 00:01:00.161
<v Speaker 1>LP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea pretty much continues and</v>

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.200
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big media companies,</v>

17
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>which facial lot of challenges now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're talking about the</v>

18
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:09.020
<v Speaker 1>traditional TV,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable TV companies,</v>

19
00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they face a lot of challenges from the</v>

20
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>new media.</v>

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>They will eventually morph into that</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

22
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>be bought by a new media company by one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and turn will still find ways to</v>

23
00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:21.260
<v Speaker 1>participate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be hard.</v>

24
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I think it's naive to think that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies are going to crumble and fall</v>

25
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:26.151
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

26
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they're going through a very tough</v>
<v Speaker 1>transition now as our people in any</v>

27
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:32.750
<v Speaker 1>industry that has to deal with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>digitization of anything.</v>

28
00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.770
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be a bunch of large companies,</v>

29
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 1>pretty much controlling a good amount of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what goes on.</v>

30
00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:41.720
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:45.320
<v Speaker 1>the way of our capitalist system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not to say that the small</v>

32
00:01:45.321 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>independent voices still won't be out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and be able to be heard,</v>

33
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:50.180
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the mass market,</v>

34
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>as it as however you wanna define it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 1>will be reachable largely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably through bigger.</v>
