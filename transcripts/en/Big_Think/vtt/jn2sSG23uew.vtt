1
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.040
<v Speaker 1>That would be a little hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I was eight years old,</v>

2
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.460
<v Speaker 1>my grandfather died and I knew that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>had written poetry because I used to see</v>

3
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>him writing poetry in his box and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to him.</v>

4
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.970
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after he died,</v>

5
00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:30.971
<v Speaker 1>I went down to the basement of my family</v>
<v Speaker 1>house where my family kept books,</v>

6
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>anthologies and things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there was an anthology without any</v>

7
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>names attached to an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read a poem called spellbound.</v>

8
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 1>And I somehow attached it to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather's death.</v>

9
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought my grandfather had written it.</v>

10
00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.050
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sure he had written it.</v>

11
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>And it was a great constellation to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something planted in my mind that</v>

12
00:00:53.061 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>you could write poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you could read poetry.</v>

13
00:00:56.391 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>The portrait could somehow console you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't sit down then and start writing</v>

14
00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>poems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was in the back of my mind.</v>

15
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Now when I was in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was leafing through an anthology that</v>

16
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 1>our teachers had given us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I found it a poem.</v>

17
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so strange.</v>

18
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this poem looks so much like my</v>

19
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>grandfather's poem that I looked for</v>
<v Speaker 1>another one GRANDPA's poem.</v>

20
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.080
<v Speaker 1>It turns out it had been written by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emily Bronte and it wasn't my</v>

21
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>grandfather's poem at wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although my response to it I think was</v>

22
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just had the author wrong.</v>

23
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that was the beginning though.</v>

24
00:01:30.741 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I didn't start writing until I was in</v>
<v Speaker 1>high school and when I was in high</v>

25
00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:34.910
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really began to,</v>

26
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.680
<v Speaker 1>I really began to write poetry with</v>
<v Speaker 1>great energy and enthusiasm.</v>

27
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>I was in high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to show them to my sister and I</v>

28
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>thought everything I wrote was so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my poor sister,</v>

29
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.450
<v Speaker 1>who's a year younger than I am,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't understand them at a wall,</v>

30
00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>but she was enthusiastic about my</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing them.</v>

31
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>When I was a freshman in college,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to Grinnell College in Iowa.</v>

32
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I brought my poems to my freshman</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanities teacher whose name was Carol</v>

33
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Parson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wonderful teacher.</v>

34
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.990
<v Speaker 1>And Carol did a really great thing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

35
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 1>She's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she taught me more than anyone.</v>

36
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.430
<v Speaker 1>She somehow read my poems and came back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and convinced me that I could be a</v>

37
00:02:15.431 --> 00:02:17.230
<v Speaker 1>poet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I had the passion and the</v>

38
00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>enthusiasm and the creativity to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poet.</v>

39
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:25.390
<v Speaker 1>But that what I was writing was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry because I was just expressing my</v>

40
00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>feelings and I wasn't trying to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

41
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>The oldest word for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for poetry and Greek is pollicis,</v>

42
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.010
<v Speaker 1>which means making a poet as a maker and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a poem as a made thing.</v>

43
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>And Carol Somehow convinced me that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>could become a poet,</v>

44
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>but that I was not writing poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I would have to try and make</v>

45
00:02:43.091 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

46
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>to write poetry and that I started then</v>
<v Speaker 1>to try and shape something rather than</v>

47
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:54.220
<v Speaker 1>just express it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when I started to shape something</v>

48
00:02:54.221 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 1>and to imitate other poems that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>written by other people,</v>

49
00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>when I tried to integrate reading and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

50
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>I was on my payoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that would have been 1968 I was</v>

51
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>a freshman in college and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't writing good poems,</v>

52
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>but I was at least trying to write</v>
<v Speaker 1>poems.</v>

53
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:14.701
<v Speaker 1>Then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been no poet,</v>

54
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>no great poet in the history of poetry</v>
<v Speaker 1>who hasn't also been a great reader of</v>

55
00:03:20.201 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sometimes distressing to my</v>

56
00:03:23.141 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>students when I tell them this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I do say it's possible.</v>

57
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>You might be the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's impossible,</v>

58
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.600
<v Speaker 1>but the odds are very much against you.</v>

59
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 1>All great poets have been great readers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way to learn your craft in</v>

60
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:41.431
<v Speaker 1>poetry is by reading other poetry and by</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting it guide you a great model for</v>

61
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:47.821
<v Speaker 1>this is the way that Dante calls on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Virgil at the beginning of the inferior.</v>

62
00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:50.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.800
<v Speaker 1>the divine comedy to help guide them</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the underworld and in a way</v>

64
00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>that's also a recognition that Dante</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs virgil and that the infare inferno</v>

65
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:10.291
<v Speaker 1>needs the Aeneid and that the epic needs</v>
<v Speaker 1>a model and that for Dante to write this</v>

66
00:04:12.011 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 1>great poem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs someone to come before him and</v>

67
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 1>he turns to Virgil's taxed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially books six where in the US</v>

68
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 1>goes down into the underworld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me that's a model of the poets</v>

69
00:04:22.631 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 1>relationship to a pre to previous</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry,</v>

70
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.970
<v Speaker 1>to another poetry as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as calling out for guidance.</v>

71
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 1>There are many poets that I use as my</v>
<v Speaker 1>models.</v>

72
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my first book of poems,</v>

73
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had several for the sleepwalkers,</v>

74
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I had several poems that were apprentice</v>
<v Speaker 1>poems like this in which I take a walk</v>

75
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a,</v>

76
00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>with a poet who's no longer alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them as I walk with Federico</v>

77
00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>Garcia Lorca around the upper west side</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Manhattan because that was a</v>

78
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood he lived in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I imagine walking around Paris with</v>

79
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Cesar via whole Great Peruvian poet who</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived in Paris.</v>

80
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

81
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I create the walk as a kind of drama of</v>

82
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 1>my apprenticeship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

83
00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>it is true that I think one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that distinguished my work from</v>

84
00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the beginning when I was in college was</v>
<v Speaker 1>my turning towards poetry from other</v>

85
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 1>countries that I didn't ever consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry.</v>

86
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 1>The province exclusively of English and</v>
<v Speaker 1>American literature.</v>

87
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And I discovered a great amount in</v>
<v Speaker 1>reading,</v>

88
00:05:32.441 --> 00:05:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Polish poetry and other eastern European</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry and reading Russian poetry and</v>

89
00:05:36.431 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 1>reading Latin American and Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 1>poetry.</v>

90
00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And I've always found models in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>other poetry's of poets who could help</v>

91
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>me on my payoff.</v>

92
00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.770
<v Speaker 1>I think it shapes it in very deep ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you don't entirely understand.</v>

93
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rainer Maria Rocha said there are two</v>

94
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.560
<v Speaker 1>sources for poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is dreams and the other is</v>

95
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think childhood is an</v>

96
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:08.711
<v Speaker 1>inexhaustible source of your becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you will be and certain deep</v>

97
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.891
<v Speaker 1>feelings are set inside of you a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>construct of emotions that really define</v>

98
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:20.621
<v Speaker 1>who you are and who you will become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I feel very much that my childhood</v>

99
00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.140
<v Speaker 1>is very alive inside of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to me,</v>

100
00:06:24.141 --> 00:06:29.141
<v Speaker 1>very much part of me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm at an a sometimes painful,</v>

101
00:06:29.541 --> 00:06:34.541
<v Speaker 1>sometimes joyous in exhaustible resource</v>
<v Speaker 1>for poetry and a lot of portraits.</v>

102
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Putting yourself back into the state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder that you have before things when</v>

103
00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 1>you're a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not only a joyous wonder,</v>

104
00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:45.170
<v Speaker 1>it's sometimes a grief stricken wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

105
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

106
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.370
<v Speaker 1>the idea that lyric poetry is a poetry</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's driven by a sense of the presence</v>

107
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:53.204
<v Speaker 1>of death.</v>

108
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>That there's something unbearable about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that we're going to die and</v>

109
00:06:57.891 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>that we can't stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think you find that out in</v>

110
00:07:01.371 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>childhood and you don't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I found that out in childhood</v>

111
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:09.020
<v Speaker 1>and I found that hard to get over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now I'm 60 years old and I still</v>

112
00:07:09.021 --> 00:07:11.960
<v Speaker 1>find it hard to get over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's one of the things that</v>

113
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 1>drive lyric poetry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our sense of mortality,</v>

114
00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>our sense that things are transient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that everything is passing.</v>
