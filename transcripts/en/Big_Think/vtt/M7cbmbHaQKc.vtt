1
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Pages contains all the innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you need to do is preserve those</v>

2
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>who are innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the hammer,</v>

3
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 1>no reward for being innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the founding fathers put that in the</v>

4
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

5
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.210
<v Speaker 1>everybody talks about the rights of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people this,</v>

6
00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That right.</v>

7
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>I went to a graduation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife got a doctorate in public health</v>

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>and the speaker said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a right to good health or</v>

9
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.640
<v Speaker 1>saying what are they talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've lost their minds.</v>

10
00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>It means I'm never going to have a tooth</v>
<v Speaker 1>to gang.</v>

11
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I've never even had a stomach ache,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>I ever write to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>not have cancer or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who going to give me these rights?</v>

14
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.420
<v Speaker 1>The only right that is spelled out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution is the copyright.</v>

15
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>And what it says is those who innovate</v>
<v Speaker 1>should get the reward for their</v>

16
00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for copyright from patents and a general</v>

17
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>ip on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Lincoln was a big believer in this.</v>

18
00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:09.010
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln took out some patents and uh,</v>

19
00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 1>he loved the idea of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you think to yourself,</v>

20
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.350
<v Speaker 1>what could encourage innovation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of conventional thinkers who would</v>

21
00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:18.184
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

22
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.160
<v Speaker 1>just you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the government to spend a lot more</v>

23
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>money on our end date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the founder says,</v>

24
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:24.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fine,</v>

25
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but the best thing we can do to spur our</v>
<v Speaker 1>r and d is not spent any money but to</v>

26
00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:33.070
<v Speaker 1>provide it so that the creators get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep what they have.</v>
