1
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the,</v>

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 2>the criminal line withdrawn way too far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

4
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my colleagues and friends who are in the</v>

5
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Chicano movement in the southwest often</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

6
00:00:17.531 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't cross the border.</v>

7
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 2>The border crossed us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

8
00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.960
<v Speaker 2>We were here then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then America came,</v>

9
00:00:22.961 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 2>so don't call us immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

10
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Speaker 2>similar thing happened with crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.110
<v Speaker 2>It's not so much that we became more</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal,</v>

12
00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 2>is that more things became criminal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One way to think about it is that during</v>

13
00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 2>Jim Crow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

14
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Simply being black in public space with</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal activity,</v>

15
00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So going to a movie theater and sitting</v>

16
00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 2>in the downstairs instead of upstairs</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a crime,</v>

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.640
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drinking out of the wrong water fountain</v>

18
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 2>was a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fitting in the front of the bus was a</v>

19
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 2>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we look at those things now and</v>

20
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

21
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

22
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.000
<v Speaker 2>The d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are clearly just patterns of</v>

23
00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:59.620
<v Speaker 2>people's lives and behavior.</v>

24
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.130
<v Speaker 2>These are things that we think of is</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of choice and the right to</v>

25
00:01:03.131 --> 00:01:05.920
<v Speaker 2>assemble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so how could we have thought of them</v>

26
00:01:05.921 --> 00:01:08.590
<v Speaker 2>as criminals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the the line of what constitutes</v>

27
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:12.130
<v Speaker 2>crime is socially constructed can move</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forward.</v>

28
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My parent's relationship with the</v>

29
00:01:14.351 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 2>criminal relationship in the state of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virginia where I grew up three years</v>

30
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 2>before we came there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I mean three years before we moved to</v>

31
00:01:22.271 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 2>Virginia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my parents relationship was in fact a</v>

32
00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:30.151
<v Speaker 2>criminal relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what I know for certain is that we</v>

33
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:35.230
<v Speaker 2>can change what constitutes crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then in doing so we don't make a</v>

34
00:01:35.231 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 2>world that is more dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we actually make a world that is</v>

35
00:01:38.651 --> 00:01:43.651
<v Speaker 2>more free so we can say that we are as</v>
<v Speaker 2>unconcerned with inner city high school</v>

36
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:51.271
<v Speaker 2>kids smoking pot at the bus stop as we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are about Princeton kids getting drunk</v>

37
00:01:51.881 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 2>to the point of killing brain cells.</v>

38
00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Every Thursday night we can just simply</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

39
00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are not activities that make us</v>

40
00:01:59.681 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 2>afraid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not afraid of young people were</v>

41
00:02:01.931 --> 00:02:05.260
<v Speaker 2>not afraid of the choices that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making that we don't have to police</v>

42
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:07.780
<v Speaker 2>every single activity to the point of</v>
<v Speaker 2>incarceration,</v>

43
00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.960
<v Speaker 2>that we can have laws on the book that</v>
<v Speaker 2>stamps sort of our,</v>

44
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.360
<v Speaker 2>our social code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About what matters,</v>

45
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.510
<v Speaker 2>but that we do not have to police them</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same level.</v>

46
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 2>We don't in fact have to kind of fill</v>
<v Speaker 2>our jails with people who are doing</v>

47
00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.470
<v Speaker 2>petty property,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

48
00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 2>petty drug crime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

49
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Petty drug crime does not require the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of massive incarceration that it's</v>

50
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 2>currently getting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can talk about property crime,</v>

51
00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

52
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>physical crimes,</v>

53
00:02:35.531 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 2>a rape and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but those things,</v>

54
00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:40.690
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have all been into Kline as we have</v>

55
00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 2>grown our prison population in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>petty drug crime.</v>

56
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 2>There is no war on drugs is a war on</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of petty drug users.</v>

57
00:02:48.281 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 2>And I think we could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could make a choice not to be in that</v>

58
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 2>war.</v>
