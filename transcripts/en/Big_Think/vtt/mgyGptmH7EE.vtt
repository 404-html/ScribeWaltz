1
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Makers is essentially about the science</v>
<v Speaker 1>of why we like what we like and one of</v>

2
00:00:10.121 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting answers to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>question is Maya m,</v>

3
00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:18.370
<v Speaker 1>a y,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a most advanced yet acceptable,</v>

4
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and this was the theory of everything by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Loewy,</v>

5
00:00:22.091 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 1>the father of industrial design in</v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

6
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of people today don't know who</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raymond Loewy is,</v>

7
00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>but this is a guy who was essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like Steve Jobs meets don draper</v>

8
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>for the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He invented or designed the first.</v>

9
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>I'll go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He designed a the most famous car</v>

10
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>designer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century,</v>

11
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:42.280
<v Speaker 1>the 1950 studebaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern train,</v>

12
00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:44.590
<v Speaker 1>the modern Greyhound bus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the modern tractor.</v>

13
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 1>Even that pencil sharpener that looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an egg.</v>

14
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>That was his design,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in thinking about this question,</v>

15
00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:54.910
<v Speaker 1>how could one person understand what</v>
<v Speaker 1>consumers want from things as different</v>

16
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>as cars and pencil sharpeners?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His answer was this Maya,</v>

17
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>most advanced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet acceptable.</v>

18
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.970
<v Speaker 1>People are torn between neophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand they like new things and</v>

19
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>neophobia on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of anything that's too</v>

20
00:01:10.031 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>new and he was this genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

21
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:17.371
<v Speaker 1>It combining familiarity and surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the most useful way to think</v>

22
00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:22.501
<v Speaker 1>about the Maya principal is to think of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as to sell something familiar,</v>

23
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.780
<v Speaker 1>make it surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you sell something surprising.</v>

24
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>Make it familiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take an example like star wars.</v>

25
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>George Lucas was working on star wars</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long,</v>

26
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The script was absolutely terrible.</v>

27
00:01:34.211 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 1>He was sharing it with his best friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Francis Ford Coppola,</v>

28
00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 1>and they were all telling him that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>script was absolute garbage and he had</v>

29
00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>essentially built this incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising novel new world filled with</v>

30
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 1>jet eyes and forces and magic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures that no one had seen before.</v>

31
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>And then he was reading this book by</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell on the mono myth on this</v>

32
00:01:54.671 --> 00:01:58.630
<v Speaker 1>idea that every great story in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>history has essentially been the same</v>

33
00:01:58.631 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>story of an ordinary person who goes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>an extraordinary journey.</v>

34
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Defeats a nemesis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimately involved in his own origin</v>

35
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then comes back to the real world as</v>

36
00:02:09.581 --> 00:02:10.930
<v Speaker 1>the hero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we said,</v>

37
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is it.</v>

38
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.200
<v Speaker 1>This is the story that explains that as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

39
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.260
<v Speaker 1>That is Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the odyssey and the Iliad.</v>

40
00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll take this incredibly familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and I'll put it into this</v>

41
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>incredibly surprising world building</v>
<v Speaker 1>exercise and that is star wars.</v>

42
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.530
<v Speaker 1>It essentially sells and incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising world in incredibly familiar</v>

43
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:35.620
<v Speaker 1>narrative setting and I think that's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why we like it.</v>

44
00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:38.260
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much that it's novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

45
00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it's a novel setting that is essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>telling the oldest story known to man so</v>

46
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.290
<v Speaker 1>it matters where you're starting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're starting with an incredibly</v>

47
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:52.291
<v Speaker 1>familiar product or a really familiar</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual property like say movies</v>

48
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and creating a movie sequel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The challenge for those writers is how</v>

49
00:02:55.931 --> 00:03:00.931
<v Speaker 1>do we create a surprising new story that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get people to a familiar character?</v>

50
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But lots of people are dealing with the</v>

51
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>opposite problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a new idea and they're trying</v>

52
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 1>to make it familiar to an audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best example is from here all</v>

53
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>come from technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about,</v>

54
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

55
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the first apple macintosh where Steve</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs famously said,</v>

56
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>I need the screen to say hello.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need it to look like a face.</v>

57
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.920
<v Speaker 1>He's creating an entirely new product</v>
<v Speaker 1>category that people aren't really used</v>

58
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:29.530
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he understands how critically</v>

59
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.970
<v Speaker 1>important it is to take something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is novel and to sell it through</v>

60
00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>familiarity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a friend you see the exact same</v>

61
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:42.781
<v Speaker 1>thing I think with ai assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like Alexa have a lilting female</v>

62
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 1>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could argue is a sort of</v>

63
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>working with a gendered expectation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an assistant,</v>

64
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's still working in the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle to sell a really new</v>

65
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a little nub that has ai</v>

66
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>intelligence inside of it.</v>

67
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>Make it talk just like you would expect</v>
<v Speaker 1>an assistant to talk to you.</v>

68
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I think about this issue also with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone.</v>

69
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 1>Most famously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs was not creating a product</v>
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

71
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>but he did create the most profitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>product in modern human history.</v>

72
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's important to remember that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>iphone did not look new.</v>

73
00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It looked like a touch ipod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked exactly like a product that</v>

74
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>apple already had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when people picked it up,</v>

75
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

76
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to use this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does it work?</v>

77
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>He essentially took an information</v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem that they understood and said,</v>

78
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>now it also does calls and Internet and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think that it's really important</v>

79
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 1>when selling a new product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when taking a new idea and trying to</v>

80
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:47.140
<v Speaker 1>make it appealing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to make it popular to not think</v>

81
00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>about making that surprising idea as</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising as possible because people</v>

82
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>love to be surprised.</v>

83
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.690
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take the surprising idea and make people</v>

84
00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.630
<v Speaker 1>feel comfortable with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it feel like home,</v>

85
00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:01.390
<v Speaker 1>make it feel familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's also interesting to</v>

86
00:05:01.391 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>juxtapose this idea with google glass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Google's sort of famously</v>

87
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>flopping product where it looked like</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacles kind of,</v>

88
00:05:08.861 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>but they had like a huge cube here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is that I think one of the big</v>

89
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.540
<v Speaker 1>problems with Google glass is that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked like a prototype.</v>

90
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.730
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a toy for nerds and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact I went to x rays and lane wrote a</v>

91
00:05:21.731 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>cover story about X.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to a lot of people who</v>

92
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>worked on Google glass and they said the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest problem with its rollout is that</v>

93
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:33.601
<v Speaker 1>we had a prototype for nerds and we sold</v>
<v Speaker 1>it as a product for consumers and that</v>

94
00:05:35.351 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>was a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We told people that this is the new</v>

95
00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is the new product category</v>

96
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.750
<v Speaker 1>that's going to redefine the way that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>interact with computers and the</v>

97
00:05:43.751 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really what it was.</v>

98
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 1>It was a nice tool for manufacturing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction workers to put something on</v>

99
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 1>that looked like goggles and record</v>
<v Speaker 1>their work and send it back to</v>

100
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>supervisors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stop for two seconds and think who</v>

101
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 1>wears goggles on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one people wear glasses,</v>

102
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but google glass didn't look like</v>
<v Speaker 1>glasses.</v>

103
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 1>They looked like Weirdo goggles and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it's really important when</v>

104
00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>trying to introduce new product category</v>
<v Speaker 1>to think as clearly as possible.</v>

105
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 1>How do I make this feel as familiar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>its core audience as possible?</v>

106
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Particularly when it's a bright new idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think the Google failed</v>

107
00:06:20.871 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>tremendously in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that aspect because they didn't</v>

108
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>understand properly enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The habits and the familiarities of the</v>

109
00:06:26.631 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>people that they were ultimately selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
