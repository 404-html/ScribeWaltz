1
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another great question.</v>

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I actually think of myself primarily as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political intellectual and so,</v>

3
00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

4
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of what drove me into legal</v>

5
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:27.160
<v Speaker 1>academia was at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than another kind of academia was</v>

6
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.880
<v Speaker 1>the idea that I wanted to do something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was politically engaged with the</v>

7
00:00:30.881 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my first level is literature as an</v>

8
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>English major.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an undergraduate.</v>

9
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I still teach law and literature</v>
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.820
<v Speaker 1>I do actually think that literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot to tell us about civil</v>

11
00:00:39.821 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time I was very</v>

12
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 1>politically active and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many humanists to go to law school,</v>

13
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>have their stories so it need not</v>
<v Speaker 1>detained as long.</v>

14
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>But my thought was if I actually care</v>
<v Speaker 1>about these causes,</v>

15
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>I can probably do more for them than to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write papers on the renaissance about</v>

16
00:00:56.801 --> 00:00:59.590
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so when I went to law school and I</v>

17
00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:00.131
<v Speaker 1>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

18
00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:05.131
<v Speaker 1>maybe I should go into practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once I delved into the practical or</v>

19
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>the world of practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should say,</v>

20
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I quickly realized that part of what was</v>

21
00:01:10.451 --> 00:01:15.451
<v Speaker 1>really important to me was the ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual enterprise.</v>

22
00:01:15.461 --> 00:01:19.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I split the difference by</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a legal academic who is very</v>

23
00:01:19.571 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>engaged in politics and in activism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly gay rights activism,</v>

24
00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>but civil rights activism or broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>who nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope is trying to generate some new</v>

26
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>ideas about how this kind of activism</v>
<v Speaker 1>activism.</v>
