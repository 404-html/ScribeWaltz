1
00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look over the last decade or so,</v>

2
00:00:07.581 --> 00:00:11.450
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest shift we've seen as</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of the final breakdown of the</v>

3
00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>traditional channel based structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way we tend to think about</v>

4
00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:18.260
<v Speaker 1>communications as paid media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earned media owned media,</v>

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of sort of traditional siloed</v>

6
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>approach to communications that we still</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear a lot from marketing textbooks and</v>

7
00:00:25.401 --> 00:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>business school and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 1>I think what has happened is that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process of the law,</v>

9
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.600
<v Speaker 1>the 20 years proceeding the last decade</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about fragmentation,</v>

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Types of channels,</v>

11
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellite TV and mobile networks and</v>

12
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>just as incredible proliferation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of content and channels within the</v>

13
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.901
<v Speaker 1>silos that left people feeling like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>had infinite choice but left</v>

14
00:00:50.391 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>communicators feeling like it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to reach an audience.</v>

15
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>What social media has done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly facebook and twitter have</v>

16
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 1>created a glue to knit all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragments back together into something</v>

17
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:06.671
<v Speaker 1>that feels like one big graph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one big network of content moving</v>

18
00:01:07.161 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 1>between channels and unpredictable ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>of engaging with people in ways that we</v>

19
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 1>can't necessarily predict of creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

20
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Two directional conversational dialogues</v>
<v Speaker 1>and communication between individuals</v>

21
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:22.910
<v Speaker 1>and and the people that we're trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach and inspire,</v>

22
00:01:22.911 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>which is new behavior for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It requires marketers and communicators</v>

23
00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>and publishers to develop new skills</v>
<v Speaker 1>like listening,</v>

24
00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That we didn't used to have to do,</v>

25
00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just pick the channel and we pick the</v>

26
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>right message and we said something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>an audience that was mostly pretty</v>

27
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 1>passive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is the big shift in</v>

28
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the real challenge for a lot of</v>

29
00:01:46.041 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>organizations is the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are now part of a graph with the</v>

30
00:01:50.661 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>people that we're trying to inspire</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than them being a stable audience</v>

31
00:01:54.561 --> 00:01:58.190
<v Speaker 1>that we're trying to reach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And us being in a stable position as</v>

32
00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.050
<v Speaker 1>inspire or publisher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we now have to participate in the</v>

33
00:02:03.051 --> 00:02:03.651
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

34
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 1>People create content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we create content,</v>

35
00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>they share content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we share content.</v>

36
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>And that means that we have to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>differently about how we communicate,</v>

37
00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>how we tell stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much content we have to create.</v>

38
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>We can't reliably predict where that</v>
<v Speaker 1>content is going to get consumed.</v>

39
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:23.681
<v Speaker 1>So it's really easy to get into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where if we're not really</v>

40
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:28.220
<v Speaker 1>clear about our values and our identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and who we are and what we're trying to</v>

41
00:02:28.221 --> 00:02:31.280
<v Speaker 1>achieve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where sort of our values and mission sit</v>

42
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>as an organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can become really easy to sound</v>

43
00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.990
<v Speaker 1>schizophrenia to the communities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to engage.</v>

44
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.040
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of organizations are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still really struggling with this</v>

45
00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:45.620
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still feels really unsettling to</v>

46
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 1>folks because it means wholescale</v>
<v Speaker 1>changing of the way we think about</v>

47
00:02:49.791 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>content and communication and publishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>even means different,</v>

48
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different org charts.</v>

49
00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>Rethinking how we shape the</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations and design and staff and</v>

50
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>how teams work together and how people</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborate are all different than they</v>

51
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>used to be.</v>

52
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's still a change process that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think a lot of a lot of us in a lot of</v>

53
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>organizations are still working their</v>
<v Speaker 1>way through.</v>

54
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>So when we think about politics and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what's changed in</v>

55
00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important changes to the</v>

56
00:03:17.591 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 1>communication landscape is the shift</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the necessity of being able to</v>

57
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>listen effectively at scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

58
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>The necessity of seeing the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were engaging as relationships we're</v>

59
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>trying to create and the necessity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>empathy and listening as part of</v>

60
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:37.741
<v Speaker 1>starting relationships is fundamental to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication now rather than either</v>

61
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 1>orthogonal or accidental or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nice to have,</v>

62
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the fundamental nature of many</v>

63
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>of the communication mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We use our bi directional now and that</v>

64
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>means our habits have to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

65
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great advantages of digital</v>

66
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>technologies is the capacity to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and scale.</v>

67
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.670
<v Speaker 1>That's something that wasn't possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

68
00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>Digital tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to,</v>

70
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>to take,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use data and to use smart sort of</v>

71
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 1>tools and listening to listening tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

72
00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:14.530
<v Speaker 1>things like radian six and crimson</v>
<v Speaker 1>hexagon and there are a lot of these</v>

73
00:04:14.531 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>platforms out there for the sort of UCM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly in sort of enterprise marketing</v>

74
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>spaces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but work really well in politics and</v>

75
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>social good and these other places to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get a sense for what people believe in,</v>

76
00:04:24.611 --> 00:04:28.330
<v Speaker 1>think in social conversations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because so much of this conversation is</v>

77
00:04:28.331 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>happening in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the question about listening is</v>

78
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>mostly a cultural one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

79
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:37.960
<v Speaker 1>The tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's tools aren't perfect and they're</v>

80
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.800
<v Speaker 1>not all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

81
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>some of them are pretty expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So not necessarily the easiest things to</v>

82
00:04:42.911 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>implement and building skills and hiring</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and thinking about this as,</v>

83
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.310
<v Speaker 1>as a skill set that needs to be part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your team as part of this process.</v>

84
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.790
<v Speaker 1>But before any of that is a belief that</v>
<v Speaker 1>listening is important but a belief and,</v>

85
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:03.361
<v Speaker 1>and creating a culture where questioning</v>
<v Speaker 1>your own certainty and validating your</v>

86
00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:10.471
<v Speaker 1>own certainty and putting the community</v>
<v Speaker 1>first in terms of how,</v>

87
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 1>how you want to be able to reach and</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspire the people that you're trying to</v>

88
00:05:15.941 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>engage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's selling a product or</v>

89
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>trying to win an election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>These things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a function of how the</v>

91
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 1>landscape works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not particularly partisan.</v>

92
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not particularly about politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

93
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 1>but it requires a cultural belief in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>value of listening,</v>

94
00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 1>which is not something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all leaders come by naturally.</v>

95
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of,</v>

96
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.670
<v Speaker 1>part of this is a discussion about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>value of empathy,</v>

97
00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of the value of really the necessity</v>

98
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:56.581
<v Speaker 1>of understanding the values and beliefs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and emotions behind what people value</v>

99
00:05:57.501 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 1>and believe as part of building real</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with people.</v>

100
00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where again,</v>

101
00:06:03.771 --> 00:06:08.300
<v Speaker 1>digital tools make starting</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with more people easier,</v>

102
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 1>but maintaining relationships is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

103
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is one of the great challenges</v>

104
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>of large scale community organizing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the things that we were able to</v>

105
00:06:19.641 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly back in 2008 with the first</v>

106
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:27.101
<v Speaker 1>Obama campaign when we were sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>treading a lot of new ground just</v>

107
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>because timing has a lot to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>success of a rain dance,</v>

108
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's,</v>

109
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>it created the ability for us to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of volunteers,</v>

110
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.180
<v Speaker 1>which we could never have recruited</v>
<v Speaker 1>without these new platforms.</v>

111
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:44.760
<v Speaker 1>We just couldn't have had that many</v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings are we just wrote,</v>

112
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.430
<v Speaker 1>have run out of hours in the day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>time in the campaign.</v>

113
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And it allowed us to accelerate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>recruiting process and the engagement</v>

114
00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>process by creating more doors and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways into the campaign for more people.</v>

115
00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>But mainly making sure all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people felt valuable.</v>

116
00:07:00.261 --> 00:07:05.261
<v Speaker 1>And heard and respected and part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>process and enabled to do good work that</v>

117
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>had value that was on mission is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous commitment of work and there</v>

118
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:15.011
<v Speaker 1>are thousands of field organizers in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama community who did the work of</v>

119
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 1>supporting those relationships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is one of the big</v>

120
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>shifts in thinking about from audience</v>
<v Speaker 1>to community,</v>

121
00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where speaking at someone and saying the</v>

122
00:07:27.651 --> 00:07:32.180
<v Speaker 1>right thing to you at the right time in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the right channel is a very linear</v>

123
00:07:32.181 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

124
00:07:33.081 --> 00:07:35.780
<v Speaker 1>This is traditional microtargeting and</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketing,</v>

125
00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to figure out what you're</v>

126
00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 1>listening to or what you're watching so</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can show you the right message and</v>

127
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:44.390
<v Speaker 1>you're just going to consume it and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to change your mind.</v>

128
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:49.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is a little bit the sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Magic Madman idea,</v>

129
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.170
<v Speaker 1>Like the perfect dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect sort of great idea and there</v>

131
00:07:54.171 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 1>is value to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creativity and content is still super</v>

132
00:07:57.621 --> 00:08:00.980
<v Speaker 1>central to how we communicate and how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell stories.</v>

133
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 1>But the process is not that linear</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

134
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 1>And so thinking about how we engage</v>
<v Speaker 1>people as a relationship we are building</v>

135
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:15.521
<v Speaker 1>over time rather than just a transaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>at a moment in time is this is I think</v>

136
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>the starting point to start bringing</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other ideas into the conversation</v>

137
00:08:19.461 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>about empathy and what you think and</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe and feel and listening to you.</v>

138
00:08:23.841 --> 00:08:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And people will tell you what they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ask them.</v>

139
00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.670
<v Speaker 1>This is the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

140
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 1>people ask a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:34.760
<v Speaker 1>how do you know what people think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is in politics we knock</v>

142
00:08:34.761 --> 00:08:37.460
<v Speaker 1>on a lot of doors and we have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>

143
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.590
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of millions of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally conversations where we are</v>

144
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.800
<v Speaker 1>asking questions and talking to voters</v>
<v Speaker 1>and asking what they think and who they</v>

145
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.340
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

146
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>And we keep all that data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a massive listening exercise.</v>

147
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:55.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a massive exercise in is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is our view and vision for the future</v>

148
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>compelling and is it getting through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we making sense?</v>

149
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>Are we reaching people and connecting</v>
<v Speaker 1>with people in a way that is relevant to</v>

150
00:09:02.611 --> 00:09:04.170
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or are we missing something?</v>

151
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people will tell you if you ask</v>

152
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually that complicated.</v>

153
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:13.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to do at scale.</v>

154
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that has to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>staffed for,</v>

155
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.481
<v Speaker 1>and the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

156
00:09:17.481 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 1>the piece of this that I think if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first part is about culture or the last</v>

157
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>part is about adjusting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a misconception that you can</v>

158
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:27.930
<v Speaker 1>just start publishing and just create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>page.</v>

159
00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

160
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one charges you or anything.</v>

161
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 1>You just start doing stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Creating content isn't free.</v>

162
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Responding to comments isn't free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being careful about the ladder of</v>

163
00:09:38.401 --> 00:09:41.520
<v Speaker 1>engagement you're creating with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inspiring them and engaging with</v>

164
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 1>them and answering their questions isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

165
00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That requires teams and talent and</v>

166
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.640
<v Speaker 1>energy and commitment to creativity that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to pay for.</v>

167
00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's a place the staffing changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the way this changes the way we</v>

168
00:09:55.891 --> 00:09:59.340
<v Speaker 1>think about like communications</v>
<v Speaker 1>departments is pretty profound.</v>
