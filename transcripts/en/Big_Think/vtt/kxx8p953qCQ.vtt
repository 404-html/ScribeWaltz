00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>This president is is really establishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tremendous legacy on the environment</v>

2
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.190
<v Speaker 1>as as well as the economy and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>need to speak to the economy.</v>

3
00:00:10.191 --> 00:00:13.100
<v Speaker 1>Let me speak to my issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4
00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I have been engaged since day one on</v>
<v Speaker 1>efforts to reduce carbon pollution.</v>

5
00:00:17.511 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Most notably in the car industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take a look at the cause of</v>

6
00:00:21.531 --> 00:00:24.860
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have three times as many models for</v>

7
00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:29.861
<v Speaker 1>sale today as you had when he took</v>
<v Speaker 1>office that are 30 miles a gallon per</v>

8
00:00:29.991 --> 00:00:32.600
<v Speaker 1>gallon or more in terms of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficiency.</v>

9
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>That is because of actions of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>We are doubling fuel economy by 2025</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're doing that as a fuel economy</v>

11
00:00:40.671 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 1>standard and a carbon pollution</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

12
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.240
<v Speaker 1>We have been looking at reducing toxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>emissions from utilities.</v>

13
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.450
<v Speaker 1>We actually put forward something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks at reducing mercury and arsenic,</v>

14
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.110
<v Speaker 1>things that we haven't been able to move</v>
<v Speaker 1>forward on and the result of that is</v>

15
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.600
<v Speaker 1>that it's already past the compliance</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

16
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>We never threatened reliability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got some,</v>

17
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.640
<v Speaker 1>some of those old inefficient units have</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone out that didn't have modern</v>

18
00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.550
<v Speaker 1>controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our communities are healthier.</v>

19
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.010
<v Speaker 1>We're saving up to 11,000 lives every</v>
<v Speaker 1>year ever was.</v>

20
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.110
<v Speaker 1>As a result of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have renewables when three times as</v>

21
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>much as when this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when this president came into office 10</v>

22
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>times more solar than we've ever had and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are becoming competitive</v>

23
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have also have grown in the,</v>

24
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>in the building trades in terms of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you build energy efficient homes and</v>

25
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have grown thousands and thousands of</v>

26
00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:41.390
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are building the the economy of the</v>

27
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:46.391
<v Speaker 1>future by building in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>considerations on environment into those</v>

28
00:01:46.401 --> 00:01:49.160
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at water rules today.</v>

29
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.490
<v Speaker 1>I am actually moving forward with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>final rule that is going to settle the</v>

30
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:59.711
<v Speaker 1>question of what waters are important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect so we can protect people's</v>

31
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>drinking water into the future and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>do we adapt to a changing climate.</v>

32
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>When you have California with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>significant water shortages,</v>

33
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.090
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we change the way we do business?</v>

34
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>And instead of piping water out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at green infrastructure</v>

35
00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>moving in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we have a tremendous rich legacy that</v>

36
00:02:19.011 --> 00:02:22.820
<v Speaker 1>this president is going to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think climate is,</v>

37
00:02:22.821 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>is really going to be the one that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>most talked about.</v>

38
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.210
<v Speaker 1>But frankly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our legacy needs to be that we're nimble</v>

39
00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:34.211
<v Speaker 1>enough as a government and as states</v>
<v Speaker 1>working with the federal government to</v>

40
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:39.491
<v Speaker 1>be able to see what the challenges are</v>
<v Speaker 1>today and to position our solutions in</v>

41
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:41.830
<v Speaker 1>ways that grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.230
<v Speaker 1>our ability to tackle the problems of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
