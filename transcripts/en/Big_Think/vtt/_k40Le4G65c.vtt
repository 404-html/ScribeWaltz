00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yours are that we will not get our,</v>

2
00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:14.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>environment under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The barriers are that,</v>

4
00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:19.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.250
<v Speaker 1>I saw a very interesting film,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few,</v>

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>it was on a French television program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be showing,</v>

7
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:26.840
<v Speaker 1>some people come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.703
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had been nomads in the south,</v>

10
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the desert in western Africa.</v>

11
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>And there was a fishing season and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived in trucks and they,</v>

12
00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>thousands of them went out and we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>catching these fish.</v>

13
00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>And pretty soon there were no fish left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the point of the film.</v>

14
00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.810
<v Speaker 1>And the real point of the film is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:51.350
<v Speaker 1>there aren't gonna be any fish lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the message was,</v>

16
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.500
<v Speaker 1>what are they supposed to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are they supposed to do?</v>

17
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.930
<v Speaker 1>There isn't work for them where they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started,</v>

18
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to eat.</v>

19
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>And so they come up and they take the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish.</v>

20
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a huge problem and we know that</v>

21
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:07.760
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got to keep the fish and we also</v>

22
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:11.660
<v Speaker 1>have to find work for the paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the kind of problem that's</v>

23
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:13.760
<v Speaker 1>posed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous environmental problems,</v>

24
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 1>tremendous population problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>tremendous problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.350
<v Speaker 1>of keeping the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I'd call the fanatical,</v>

27
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>dark element of human nature under</v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

28
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 1>And it only takes a few where it's out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of control to do tremendous damage.</v>

29
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>But we have terrific instruments of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation.</v>

30
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>The Internet being one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our educational institutions,</v>

31
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our economy is good.</v>

32
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>We have this economic means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so forces of points of light and</v>

33
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>possibilities of,</v>

34
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.810
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
