00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding,</v>

14
00:00:47.131 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really understand what,</v>

15
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 2>what the hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean half of them,</v>

16
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand what they're talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about and,</v>

17
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 2>and most people don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if they see something that they</v>

18
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 2>kind of enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't remember the name of the</v>

19
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.813
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

20
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.950
<v Speaker 2>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

21
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

22
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these people to keep talking</v>

23
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:09.264
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>

24
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.120
<v Speaker 2>We're on the advent of coming up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creative evolution.</v>

25
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

27
00:01:14.851 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I know there's got to be talent that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they add on.</v>

28
00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure who it was telling them</v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>

29
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have an understanding.</v>

30
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>You have to understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an understanding that everything</v>

31
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:30.620
<v Speaker 2>that I go back to what I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you do it.</v>

32
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 2>You have to have a solar farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you come up with an idea,</v>

33
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 2>a big idea it if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you show it to somebody,</v>

34
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.350
<v Speaker 2>your wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your friend or a client,</v>

35
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 2>they should go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit.</v>

36
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 2>They should your head coach and go back</v>
<v Speaker 2>and forth.</v>

37
00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be such and such a surprising</v>

38
00:01:49.831 --> 00:01:51.870
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only chance you have to do anything.</v>

39
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 2>That's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I has to be a shock when you first see</v>

40
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:55.794
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

41
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what people do is they,</v>

42
00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.293
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

43
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just.</v>

44
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the work is so unambitious,</v>

45
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a television commercial is a little</v>

46
00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 2>films,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 2>something's going on and you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on and just say,</v>

48
00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 2>well what is it about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you're looking for who the</v>

49
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 2>client is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when you see it you say,</v>

50
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

52
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 2>I tried to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a wasteland of a creativity,</v>

53
00:02:24.241 --> 00:02:26.210
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can't believe they're hidden</v>

54
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.180
<v Speaker 2>talent that day because I know I pay</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

55
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 2>I have fans who profess your love of my</v>

<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

57
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 2>to kind of be something you to learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>from it.</v>

58
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got to be learning from it is that</v>

59
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.880
<v Speaker 2>when you do something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it should be an issue.</v>

60
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 2>We had not got idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.330

<v Speaker 2>and in most cases,</v>

62
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 2>certainly in</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly in an editorial and in which I</v>

<v Speaker 2>but you have to eat when you're.</v>

67
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>Every cover is when it hit,</v>

<v Speaker 2>culturally being a culture busta.</v>

75
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing there that you could</v>
