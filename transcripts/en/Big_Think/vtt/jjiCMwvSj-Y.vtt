1
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I try to think like a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed me to,</v>

3
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>to get as far as I did get in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>But I never forgot that I was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

5
00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:20.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>I would always ask a man like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the disastrous situation we're</v>

7
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrified.</v>

8
00:00:24.271 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you scared?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they would say,</v>

9
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.421
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

10
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.590
<v Speaker 1>we're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

11
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>we're men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to show it.</v>

12
00:00:29.911 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 1>I can pretend that I'm not scared and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe if I act courageous,</v>

14
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>eventually I will be courageous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be a self fulfilling prophecy.</v>

15
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty much what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can learn some of the skills that</v>

16
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:48.561
<v Speaker 1>men have and be more like them in a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>way and without losing the things that</v>

17
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:53.610
<v Speaker 1>make you inherently a strong woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I think you've got the best of</v>

18
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:57.240
<v Speaker 1>both worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that women are wired to be good</v>

19
00:00:57.241 --> 00:00:58.410
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

20
00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>we just don't use all of our skills and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't pick up the things that the men</v>

21
00:01:03.331 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>are doing really well and learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of those skills from them.</v>

22
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:09.080
<v Speaker 1>When the women who do that are very</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong women?</v>

23
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the way that a man</v>

24
00:01:16.811 --> 00:01:21.280
<v Speaker 1>is a man does not know how to multitask</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's not going to be giving</v>

25
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>birth to triplets were multitasking</v>
<v Speaker 1>would really be important.</v>

26
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.990
<v Speaker 1>So he compartmentalizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his brain is filled with little drawers</v>

27
00:01:28.991 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>and he puts everything in these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>drawers and he pulled out a drawer and</v>

28
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>when it's time to deal with whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>content is and when he's finished it,</v>

29
00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>he puts the door back and he doesn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>distracted and so he's focused.</v>

30
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.600
<v Speaker 1>A woman's brain is kind of like my chair</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my bedroom and I was going to</v>

31
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All my clothes and possessions were</v>

32
00:01:46.181 --> 00:01:49.780
<v Speaker 1>always heaped on this chair and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of how a woman's brain and she has</v>

33
00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>everything is all mixed in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all mixed up and it's a whole like a</v>

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big glob of thoughts.</v>

35
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And in work it's probably better to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused to get a job done and</v>

36
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>concentrated enough to do a good job</v>
<v Speaker 1>with one task and then go on to the</v>

37
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.990
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you have 14 balls in the air</v>

38
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>and you drop 12 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know they're not going to remember,</v>

39
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kept two balls in the air,</v>

40
00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:17.140
<v Speaker 1>they're going to go get dropped 12 balls</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're broken.</v>

41
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 1>We're a guy's only juggling one ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he can keep that ball going forever</v>

42
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pitch it,</v>

43
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.890
<v Speaker 1>get it in the right hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem,</v>

44
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 1>and then get the next ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we,</v>

45
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 1>we can learn to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

46
00:02:32.321 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>It took me many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years to learn to do that,</v>

47
00:02:34.361 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>but we can learn that.</v>
