00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Short story</v>

2
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.070
<v Speaker 2>collection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was,</v>

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 2>I did it over a number of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starting sometime in graduate school</v>

4
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 2>when I was 23 and started publishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things up through my twenties</v>

5
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.500
<v Speaker 2>and so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been working on a novel and I</v>

6
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 2>couldn't crack the novel form at all and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kept doing short stories in the</v>

7
00:00:29.701 --> 00:00:33.870
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And finally I realized I had 11 of them</v>

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.950
<v Speaker 2>that I was proud of and that I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could be a collection I hadn't</v>

9
00:00:37.951 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 2>meant to do the pattern of publishing</v>
<v Speaker 2>short stories and then a novel.</v>

10
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 2>I thought I'm a novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it,</v>

11
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 2>but you have to kind of write a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 2>bad novels before you can write a good</v>

12
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.174
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

13
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.670
<v Speaker 2>So I did that and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but meanwhile I love it.</v>

14
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.543
<v Speaker 1>Short stories.</v>

15
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.443
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.313
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

17
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>they had a contest where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

18
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 2>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason someone in the past love</v>

19
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:07.820
<v Speaker 2>music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>musical theater.</v>

20
00:01:07.821 --> 00:01:08.654
<v Speaker 2>And so they would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

21
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.140
<v Speaker 2>if you wrote a musical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would fully fund it and put it on</v>

22
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:15.950
<v Speaker 2>the main stage with full costumes and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the set and everything.</v>

23
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.780
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my roommate,</v>

24
00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should totally do that.</v>

25
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 2>That would be awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's the same one who talked me into</v>

26
00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.360
<v Speaker 2>competing to be a commencement speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we did together.</v>

27
00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.360
<v Speaker 2>She always had ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She thought no one else was going to try</v>

28
00:01:29.361 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 2>for this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually one of them we wrote the</v>

29
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 2>night before and submitted it and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>won.</v>

30
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:34.663
<v Speaker 2>So two years</v>

31
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>that prize,</v>

32
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 2>I've tried that and it felt really</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

33
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Felt like you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff.</v>

34
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:54.651
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm good at like a description</v>
<v Speaker 2>and internal experience and memory.</v>

35
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>You can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or at least I couldn't figure out a way</v>

36
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 2>was action in present time and it was so</v>
<v Speaker 2>literal,</v>

37
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt really sort of bound as a</v>

38
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 2>storyteller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would have.</v>

39
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a good thing for me to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

40
00:02:10.381 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 2>I think I learned from it about visual</v>
<v Speaker 2>storytelling,</v>

41
00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.410
<v Speaker 2>but place you can do that a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're a little more</v>

42
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.340
<v Speaker 2>the audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine</v>

43
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.010
<v Speaker 1>the way they do in literature.</v>

44
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.430
<v Speaker 2>There was a variety of task.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wire was a fiction piece.</v>

45
00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.410
<v Speaker 2>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a.</v>

46
00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 2>That was the first thing I ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>published.</v>

47
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I sent it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was sending in dozens of stories all</v>

48
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:40.900
<v Speaker 2>over the place against the rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're supposed to double submit.</v>

49
00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I just thought I'll send them</v>
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>

50
00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:47.971
<v Speaker 2>I must say I had 200 rejection letters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then I got a call from esquire for</v>

51
00:02:48.221 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone at esquire had quit the fiction</v>

52
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:55.621
<v Speaker 2>department over some scandal and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>assistant was left in charge and he,</v>

53
00:02:55.661 --> 00:02:57.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>published my story,</v>

54
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just luck.</v>

55
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.710
<v Speaker 2>It was a cold pile.</v>
