1
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Begin by talking about the book in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florence,</v>

2
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>which resulted from my two and a half</v>
<v Speaker 1>year program of research into the</v>

3
00:00:20.181 --> 00:00:24.380
<v Speaker 1>training programs of all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different influence professions to see</v>

4
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.590
<v Speaker 1>what they do to get us to say yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was surprised by one thing that I</v>

5
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>encountered in all of these programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were only six universal</v>

6
00:00:37.131 --> 00:00:39.080
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there were hundreds,</v>

7
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>maybe thousands of individual tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only six universal principles of</v>

8
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:49.031
<v Speaker 1>influence that seemed to capture the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great majority of what all of these</v>

9
00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.090
<v Speaker 1>individuals were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reciprocity,</v>

10
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.920
<v Speaker 1>the desire to have all of us to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to someone who has given to us.</v>

11
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>So if an individual gives us something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a free sample,</v>

12
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we feel obligated to at least listen to</v>

13
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:08.240
<v Speaker 1>what they have to say at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the supermarket,</v>

14
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that little lady with the cubes of</v>

15
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>cheese and meat.</v>

16
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>After you've eaten one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to just give her back the</v>

17
00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:17.230
<v Speaker 1>toothpick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.430
<v Speaker 1>You feel like you've abs obligated to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>

19
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.230
<v Speaker 1>Reciprocity is one another is scarcity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The desire to have those things you can</v>

20
00:01:24.231 --> 00:01:27.680
<v Speaker 1>have less of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So things that are scarce,</v>

21
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>rare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwindling in availability.</v>

22
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.520
<v Speaker 1>organizations will do is to inform us of</v>
<v Speaker 1>how a rare,</v>

25
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.200
<v Speaker 1>how uncommon their features are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

26
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.580
<v Speaker 1>another principle is commitment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistency.</v>

27
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>The desire to be consistent with what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already said or done,</v>

28
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.573
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

29
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.980
<v Speaker 1>to be congruent with our internal values</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

30
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and what we've said that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

31
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.100
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one study showed that if you call people</v>

32
00:01:58.101 --> 00:01:59.350
<v Speaker 1>on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>registered voters and ask them if they</v>

34
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:07.871
<v Speaker 1>will vote in the upcoming election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they of course say yes and they now vote</v>

35
00:02:09.381 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>significantly more often than if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't receive that phone call.</v>

36
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Getting them to commit to that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

37
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.050
<v Speaker 1>Another principle is consensus or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>we call social proof.</v>

38
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>The idea that people want to follow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead of similar others,</v>

39
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 1>people just like them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've done a study,</v>

40
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in hotels,</v>

41
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much you travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

42
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I do in 70% of the hotels where I</v>

43
00:02:35.691 --> 00:02:37.880
<v Speaker 1>stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a little laminated card asking</v>

44
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>me to reuse my towels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And linen.</v>

45
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.070
<v Speaker 1>We put different kinds of cards in rooms</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what we could say on the car.</v>

46
00:02:46.071 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>That would most increased the likelihood</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people would say yes.</v>

47
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>What hotels typically say is do this for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>

48
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.520
<v Speaker 1>do this for future generations or</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate with us toward this common</v>

49
00:02:58.521 --> 00:03:03.521
<v Speaker 1>cause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We added a different sign based on the</v>

50
00:03:04.391 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>principle of consensus that people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do what everybody else is doing.</v>

51
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>It said the majority of guests who stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>at our hotel do recycle their towels at</v>

52
00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>least once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was absolutely true and it</v>

53
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>increased compliance by 28% the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing is that was a</v>

54
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:30.061
<v Speaker 1>completely costless message and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>never ever been used in any hotel in any</v>

55
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:37.981
<v Speaker 1>city that I've visited and the reason is</v>
<v Speaker 1>those managers don't know what the</v>

56
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>research says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the hopes in these books that</v>

57
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:48.391
<v Speaker 1>I've been publishing on the influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>process is to allow people outside of</v>

58
00:03:48.431 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>the academic community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the non researchers who in any</v>

59
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:58.021
<v Speaker 1>meaningful way have paid for this</v>
<v Speaker 1>research with their tax dollars to learn</v>

60
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>what we found out about them with their</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

61
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 1>They're entitled to know what we found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out about them with their money.</v>

62
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>And so that's one of the purposes of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

63
00:04:10.451 --> 00:04:15.451
<v Speaker 1>to be sure that we present this</v>
<v Speaker 1>information to the wider public besides</v>

64
00:04:16.751 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>just the academic community in which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>work was done.</v>

65
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.750
<v Speaker 1>We undertook the publication of the yes</v>
<v Speaker 1>book as a way to change the perception</v>

66
00:04:28.421 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>of persuasion as just an art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that people are born with,</v>

67
00:04:33.341 --> 00:04:38.341
<v Speaker 1>with some sort of Predator natural gift</v>
<v Speaker 1>for saying the right thing at exactly</v>

68
00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:42.700
<v Speaker 1>the right time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are artisans of the persuasion</v>

69
00:04:42.701 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no question about it,</v>

70
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.650
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out persuasion is also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>science for over a half a century.</v>

71
00:04:50.921 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Now researchers in various kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

72
00:04:55.181 --> 00:04:57.720
<v Speaker 1>mostly psychologists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communication professionals,</v>

73
00:04:57.721 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>sometimes marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:04.381
<v Speaker 1>professors in business schools have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>studying how you can say something in</v>

75
00:05:04.751 --> 00:05:09.751
<v Speaker 1>one particular way that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly increase the likelihood of</v>

76
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>ascent to that thing and have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>checking their theories and their</v>

77
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:19.771
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses in scientific experiments</v>
<v Speaker 1>that allow us lessons that we can</v>

78
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:25.891
<v Speaker 1>provide to the larger community beyond</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scientific establishment of how you</v>

79
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:31.861
<v Speaker 1>can be more effective and how you can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>confident that you will be more</v>

80
00:05:32.591 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>effective because it's grounded in true</v>
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

81
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.710
<v Speaker 1>not just hunches and speculations of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who,</v>

82
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to talk to you about this process.</v>

83
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to claim about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>principles that we talk about is that</v>

84
00:05:49.331 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 1>they are universals of influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are so central to the human</v>

85
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so fundamental to the way we work as</v>

86
00:05:57.741 --> 00:06:02.120
<v Speaker 1>citizens of modern society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you will be able to use them</v>

87
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>successfully or they can be used</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully in all kinds of domains</v>

88
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>with your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your neighbors,</v>

89
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:11.690
<v Speaker 1>with your coworkers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your boss,</v>

90
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>even with that most resistant of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences,</v>

91
00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>your children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll guarantee that these principles are</v>

92
00:06:19.461 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>so fundamental there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so psychologically central that they</v>

93
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.150
<v Speaker 1>strum strings that are inside all of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that we try to resonate with in</v>

94
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>order to behave correctly.</v>

95
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 1>The difference between influence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulation is an important and</v>

96
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>profound one like dynamite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These principles,</v>

97
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>these tactics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these lessons can be used for good or</v>

98
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference is the extent to which</v>

99
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:57.221
<v Speaker 1>they are employed</v>
<v Speaker 1>by someone who's taking a detective's</v>

100
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:03.701
<v Speaker 1>approach to the influence process rather</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a smuggler's approach.</v>

101
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 1>A smuggler imports one or another of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these principles into a situation where</v>

102
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't naturally resist exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

103
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.630
<v Speaker 1>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say for example that we use the</v>

104
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:22.631
<v Speaker 1>principle of authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can move people in our direction by</v>

105
00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>claiming to be an expert on some topic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're talking about.</v>

106
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And if they believe us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very human for them to want to take</v>

107
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 1>the shortcut route and follow what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimately constituted expert says.</v>

108
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:42.670
<v Speaker 1>If we're not in authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have exploited this process to bring</v>

109
00:07:43.161 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>people in and we've manipulated them and</v>
<v Speaker 1>their interests and their outcomes.</v>

110
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a short term success,</v>

111
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that.</v>

112
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.300
<v Speaker 1>People do say yes to us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a longterm disastrous</v>

113
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 1>consequences is that they don't want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to deal with us if we fool them</v>

114
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 1>into yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

115
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:08.210
<v Speaker 1>if we're a detective of influence and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into a situation where we recognize</v>

116
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:13.211
<v Speaker 1>that we are genuinely in authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all we have to do is raise that to the</v>

117
00:08:13.491 --> 00:08:18.491
<v Speaker 1>surface and significantly increase the</v>
<v Speaker 1>likelihood that people will be counseled</v>

118
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:23.570
<v Speaker 1>correctly into a good choice to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

119
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>we did a study with a hospital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

120
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

121
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 1>physical therapists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just asked them to put on the wall of</v>

122
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>the physical therapy lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of their credentials,</v>

123
00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:40.390
<v Speaker 1>all of their diplomas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of their awards and compliance with</v>

124
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

125
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 1>with their exercise regimens went up 30%</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately.</v>

126
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Not because it's not so surprising that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people want to follow the lead of</v>

127
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>legitimate authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The interesting thing is that that below</v>

128
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that genuine authority,</v>

129
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>all it had to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all there had to be done was that</v>

130
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>somebody like a detective Saul was there</v>
<v Speaker 1>and brought it to the surface.</v>

131
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:08.990
<v Speaker 1>So it would be available to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

132
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>to base their decisions on.</v>

133
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

134
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great question because it gets</v>

135
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:18.800
<v Speaker 1>back to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

136
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.670
<v Speaker 1>to the question of ethics again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is</v>

137
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>if somebody is trying to influence me</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've read my book,</v>

138
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know that they're trying,</v>

139
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>I should not be automatically resistant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to that.</v>

140
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I should only be resistant to the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's trying to manipulate me into yes,</v>

141
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 1>by claiming to be an authority when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>or she isn't.</v>

142
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.890
<v Speaker 1>I do want to follow the person who's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>genuine authority.</v>

143
00:09:46.891 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to follow the person who gives</v>

144
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:55.461
<v Speaker 1>me true information that what they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>rec recommending is consistent with an</v>

145
00:09:56.161 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 1>existing commitment that I've already</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a priority that I have in my life.</v>

146
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:02.590
<v Speaker 1>Or I do want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

147
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.740
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

148
00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vulnerable to the appeals of someone who</v>

149
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:11.901
<v Speaker 1>tells me about a genuinely unique or</v>
<v Speaker 1>dwindling availability that has value to</v>

150
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

151
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.780
<v Speaker 1>All of those things are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are influenced dimensions along which I</v>

152
00:10:18.781 --> 00:10:23.520
<v Speaker 1>want to move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except when they're counterfeited.</v>

153
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:28.670
<v Speaker 1>So the key is if I've read about</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and I know about it,</v>

154
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I should no longer be simply alert to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that somebody is trying to</v>

155
00:10:34.351 --> 00:10:38.970
<v Speaker 1>influence me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a more subtle differentiation.</v>

156
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.860
<v Speaker 1>I need to be alert to the person who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to influence me with genuine</v>

157
00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:48.861
<v Speaker 1>information about the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the factors that steer me correctly</v>

158
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:53.280
<v Speaker 1>versus somebody who's trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fabricate that information</v>

159
00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:59.880
<v Speaker 1>for yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are such features.</v>

160
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:02.010
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

161
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.300
<v Speaker 1>one of the principles of influence we</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about is liking people prefer to</v>

162
00:11:06.301 --> 00:11:10.410
<v Speaker 1>say yes to those they know and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the factors that causes us to</v>

163
00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 1>like somebody else is how similar we</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel to that person.</v>

164
00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So the individual who on a youtube video</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes across as,</v>

165
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.300
<v Speaker 1>as every person as just like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience to whom he or she is speaking,</v>

166
00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll get that liking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the rapport,</v>

167
00:11:29.341 --> 00:11:34.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll get the focus of attention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>will make the information more likely to</v>

168
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:35.730
<v Speaker 1>be considered.</v>

169
00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.480
<v Speaker 1>The same thing goes with the authority</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle that we've talked about.</v>

170
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>The extent to which you can appear more</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritative,</v>

171
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>more credible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more knowledgeable,</v>

172
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

173
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:52.310
<v Speaker 1>by doing something as simple as speaking</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly more</v>

174
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 1>then normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we assign greater credibility and</v>

175
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:04.141
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and confidence to people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>speak slightly more rapidly than normal.</v>

176
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>If you speak too quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you look like,</v>

177
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

178
00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:11.350
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>salesperson who's trying to pull the</v>

180
00:12:13.781 --> 00:12:16.930
<v Speaker 1>wool over their eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but slightly more rapidly than normal.</v>

181
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.980
<v Speaker 1>You get a sense this person knows what</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she is talking about and you're</v>

182
00:12:20.981 --> 00:12:23.020
<v Speaker 1>more willing to take that information</v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

183
00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if you were your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your viewers would recall,</v>

184
00:12:29.201 --> 00:12:34.201
<v Speaker 1>but there is a public service</v>
<v Speaker 1>announcement that was run back in the</v>

185
00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.550
<v Speaker 1>70s and eighties called the [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron eyes,</v>

186
00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:41.140
<v Speaker 1>cody spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the,</v>

187
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:45.700
<v Speaker 1>is reputed to be the single most</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective public service announcement</v>

188
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:49.990
<v Speaker 1>about the environment that has ever been</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent to the American public.</v>

189
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.480
<v Speaker 1>It showed a picture of a very stately</v>
<v Speaker 1>buckskin clad,</v>

190
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.300
<v Speaker 1>a native American paddling his canoe up</v>
<v Speaker 1>a river that,</v>

191
00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.403
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.120
<v Speaker 1>floated with various kinds of pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came to the side of the river.</v>

193
00:13:04.121 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 1>The bank was covered with pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He came to the side of a road also</v>

194
00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.250
<v Speaker 1>littered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A car went by and through garbage out</v>

195
00:13:12.251 --> 00:13:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the window.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fast food bag at his feet.</v>

196
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's splattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The camera panned up and you saw a tear</v>

197
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:25.030
<v Speaker 1>running down his face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very powerful message,</v>

198
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:30.930
<v Speaker 1>don't litter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have evidence that that message not</v>

199
00:13:31.391 --> 00:13:36.391
<v Speaker 1>only maybe less than optimal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may actually be damaging to the goals</v>

200
00:13:38.350 --> 00:13:43.350
<v Speaker 1>of the creators of that ad because the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sub text message was everybody's</v>

201
00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:47.163
<v Speaker 1>littering.</v>

202
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:53.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody does this and that is a more</v>
<v Speaker 1>primitive message then this native</v>

203
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:00.310
<v Speaker 1>American actor doesn't want you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

204
00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've done studies to show that if</v>

205
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.720
<v Speaker 1>somebody watches while someone else</v>
<v Speaker 1>litters into an already littered</v>

206
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.570
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as what happened in that iron eyes,</v>

207
00:14:13.571 --> 00:14:18.010
<v Speaker 1>cody spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it significantly increases the</v>

208
00:14:18.011 --> 00:14:20.710
<v Speaker 1>likelihood that observers will later</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

209
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 1>The thing you can do to decrease</v>
<v Speaker 1>littering is to have someone litter into</v>

210
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 1>a pristine environment that causes</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to say,</v>

211
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:35.830
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are a northern breaker.</v>

212
00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they see,</v>

213
00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:44.580
<v Speaker 1>they see significantly suppress their</v>
<v Speaker 1>tendency to litter as a consequence of</v>

214
00:14:44.921 --> 00:14:46.940
<v Speaker 1>seeing somebody later into a cleaning.</v>
