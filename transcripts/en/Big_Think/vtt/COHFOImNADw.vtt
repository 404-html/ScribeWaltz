00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the obvious analogy for Obama</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be Richard,</v>

2
00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:07.790
<v Speaker 1>the second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't buy it myself.</v>

3
00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:10.340
<v Speaker 1>I think Obama a stronger president than</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard.</v>

4
00:00:10.341 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>The second was a king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a man who is perhaps politically</v>

5
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.700
<v Speaker 1>naive who is perhaps too cerebral for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>the world of sorted politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could make a case for it.</v>

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I could see Obama as hamlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man given to great cerebral</v>

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>self-examination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who finally realizes he has to act.</v>

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't see Obama's Richard the third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way a lot of people cast Richard</v>

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Nixon is Richard the third.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't seem Obama as Nick Beth,</v>

11
00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>although I think Macbeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go back to it,</v>

12
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.290
<v Speaker 1>is every ambitious person or at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone with the grains of ambition who</v>

13
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>can be manipulated by an ambitious</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that you've ever known.</v>

14
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing for me about Shakespeare is</v>

15
00:00:59.131 --> 00:00:59.511
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:59.511 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>you see these people standing around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water cooler.</v>

17
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.110
<v Speaker 1>I work with a dozen he yorkers.</v>

18
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
