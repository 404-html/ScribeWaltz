00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.840
<v Speaker 1>My favorite really is a nonprofit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a young woman come to me,</v>

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's three years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and she came in my office and sat down</v>

3
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:14.810
<v Speaker 2>and take my entrepreneurship courses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she said,</v>

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York City public schools,</v>

5
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 2>there are 300 schools that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>elementary that do not have playgrounds</v>

6
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 2>for children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to fix that.</v>

7
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 2>And they just sat there and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>nodded and said,</v>

8
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting how you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>

9
00:00:25.761 --> 00:00:26.391
<v Speaker 2>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

10
00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 2>but I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you spent a year studying it,</v>

11
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Speaker 2>going around and taking pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>building a case that this was something</v>

12
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 2>that really children should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three years later,</v>

13
00:00:37.521 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 2>that young lady has raised over $10</v>
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

14
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.920
<v Speaker 2>She's already completed 20 playgrounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>in New York City,</v>

15
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:45.920
<v Speaker 2>has 20 some more in the pipeline under</v>
<v Speaker 2>construction.</v>

16
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 2>So I look at somebody like that and she</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the skill to new or anything she</v>

17
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 2>wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just am overwhelmed with the fact</v>

18
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 2>that she could go out there and do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>just with that spirit.</v>

19
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 2>And I celebrate her every time I see</v>
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>

20
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also have a company that we launched</v>

21
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 2>called Recycle Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

22
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 2>a company that's done just phenomenally</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

23
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And it came out of our program and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>worked very closely with that student,</v>

24
00:01:07.511 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 2>a Ron Gonan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's built into something very</v>

25
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.451
<v Speaker 2>special.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

26
00:01:11.451 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 2>there were awarding people for</v>
<v Speaker 2>recycling,</v>

27
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:16.790
<v Speaker 2>and it's a rewards program and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>having a dramatic effect in the cities</v>

28
00:01:16.791 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 2>that they're entering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I see a lot of growth.</v>

29
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>We just have endless numbers of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful young people.</v>

30
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:26.291
<v Speaker 1>And I get up every day just a Sullivan</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
