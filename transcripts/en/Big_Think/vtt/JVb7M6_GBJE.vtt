00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 1>If we don't heed the lessons of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>1970s,</v>

2
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>which were bad lessons and the lessons</v>
<v Speaker 1>be early part of this decade,</v>

3
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

4
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will find ourselves in trouble.</v>

5
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is no matter what happens</v>

6
00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:30.571
<v Speaker 1>during a period like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is critical to preserve the quality</v>

7
00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The schools have to continue to improve.</v>

8
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 1>Crime cannot go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideally it has to go down.</v>

9
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>The parks have to remain clean and well</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained.</v>

10
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Our cultural institutions need to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>supported.</v>

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Housing stock has to be maintained and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have to be able to afford to live</v>

12
00:00:52.511 --> 00:00:55.690
<v Speaker 1>here where you maintain the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

13
00:00:55.691 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will all suffer somewhat during a</v>

14
00:00:58.061 --> 00:01:01.300
<v Speaker 1>period of like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the mayor is the single best</v>

15
00:01:01.301 --> 00:01:06.301
<v Speaker 1>person in the world to manage through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis like this because he's very good</v>

16
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:12.661
<v Speaker 1>at finding ways of doing more with less</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understands fundamentally that what</v>

17
00:01:13.151 --> 00:01:18.151
<v Speaker 1>this all is about is maintaining and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhancing that quality of life so that</v>

18
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>when the recovery does occur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't set ourselves back so far.</v>

19
00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.950
<v Speaker 1>They will spend decades trying to dig</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves out of the hole.</v>
