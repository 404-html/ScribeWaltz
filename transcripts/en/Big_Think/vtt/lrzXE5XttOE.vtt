00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.260
<v Speaker 2>when you look at us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us as humans,</v>

3
00:00:07.261 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 2>as apes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as primates,</v>

4
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 2>as mammals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you look at some of the most</v>

5
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 2>appalling realms of our behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of it has to do with the fact that</v>

6
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>social organisms are really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really hardwired to make a basic</v>

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:27.141
<v Speaker 2>dichotomy about the social world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is those organisms who count as us</v>

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>and those who count is them and this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually universal among humans and</v>

9
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:38.340
<v Speaker 2>this is virtually universal among all</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts of social primates that have</v>

10
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 2>aspects of social structure is built</v>
<v Speaker 2>around separate social groupings of</v>

11
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 2>them's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We turn the world into us as investors</v>

12
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.770
<v Speaker 2>and we don't like them very much and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>often really awful to them and the is.</v>

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 2>We exaggerate how wonderful and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>generous and how affiliated and how.</v>

14
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 2>Just like siblings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are to us.</v>

15
00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 2>We divide the world into us and them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the greatest ways of seeing just</v>

16
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:05.580
<v Speaker 2>biologically how real this fault line</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 2>is there's this hormone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oxytocin.</v>

18
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Oxytocin is officially the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 2>grooviest hormone on earth because what</v>

19
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.880
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows is it enhances mother</v>
<v Speaker 2>infant bonding and it enhances pair</v>

20
00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 2>bonding and couples and it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 2>more trusting and empathic and</v>

21
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 2>emotionally expressive and better at</v>
<v Speaker 2>reasoning,</v>

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 2>reading expressions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more charitable,</v>

23
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.480
<v Speaker 2>and it's obvious that if you just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>spritzed oxytocin of everyone's noses on</v>

24
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 2>this planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be the garden the next day.</v>

25
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Oxytocin promotes prosocial behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>until people look closely and it turns</v>

26
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:47.691
<v Speaker 2>out oxytocin does all these wondrous</v>
<v Speaker 2>things only for people who you think of</v>

27
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 2>as an us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as an in group member.</v>

28
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.260
<v Speaker 2>It improves in group favoritism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in group parochialism.</v>

29
00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 2>What does it do to individuals who you</v>
<v Speaker 2>consider then it makes you crappy or to</v>

30
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 2>them more preemptively,</v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive,</v>

31
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.120
<v Speaker 2>less cooperative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an economic game.</v>

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 2>What oxytocin does is enhanced this us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and them divide so that along with other</v>

33
00:02:12.871 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 2>findings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>classical lines of us versus them along</v>

34
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:19.740
<v Speaker 2>the lines of race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of sex,</v>

35
00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 2>of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of social,</v>

36
00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:21.750
<v Speaker 2>economic class.</v>

37
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Your brain processes these us them</v>
<v Speaker 2>differences on the scale of</v>

38
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A 20th of a second,</v>

39
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 2>your brain is already responding</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently to an US versus them.</v>

40
00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so collectively,</v>

41
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.500
<v Speaker 2>this is depressing as hell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

42
00:02:37.501 --> 00:02:42.501
<v Speaker 2>we are hardwired to inevitably be awful</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them's and them's along all sorts of</v>

43
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 2>disturbing lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

44
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 2>if only we could overcome these us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>them dichotomy's,</v>

45
00:02:48.271 --> 00:02:49.830
<v Speaker 2>the worldly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

46
00:02:49.831 --> 00:02:54.831
<v Speaker 2>Are we hard wire to divide the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>along lines of race and ethnicity and</v>

47
00:02:55.621 --> 00:03:00.621
<v Speaker 2>nationality and all those disturbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things and what becomes clear is when</v>

48
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:05.791
<v Speaker 2>you look closely is it is virtually</v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable that we divide the world into</v>

49
00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>offices and thems and don't like them</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much into treat them well,</v>

50
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.760
<v Speaker 2>but we are incredibly easily manipulated</v>
<v Speaker 2>as to who counts as an us and who counts</v>

51
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 2>is of them and those fault lines that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>view as,</v>

52
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how ancient can you get that?</v>

53
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 2>Say somebody of another race of volks</v>
<v Speaker 2>limbic responses in US commensurate with</v>

54
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 2>they are them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They respond,</v>

55
00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 2>they motivate automatic responses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

56
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Is that just the basic fault line and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you do something like have faces of</v>

57
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:44.161
<v Speaker 2>same race versus other race and either</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are or aren't wearing a baseball</v>

58
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:48.980
<v Speaker 2>cap with your favorite team's logo on it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you completely redefined who's in</v>

59
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>US is people who like the Yankees and</v>

60
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:57.370
<v Speaker 2>them are red sox fans and suddenly</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're processing within milliseconds</v>

61
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 2>what damn baseball cap they haven't race</v>
<v Speaker 2>as being completely ignored.</v>

62
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are negatively hardwired to make</v>

63
00:04:05.621 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>really distressing us that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulated within seconds as to who</v>

64
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 2>counts as us as event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good news with that,</v>

65
00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 2>we can manipulate us out of some of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst us,</v>

66
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 2>them dichotomy's and recategorize</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

67
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Bad News.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could be manipulated by all sorts of</v>

68
00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.991
<v Speaker 2>audio logs out there as to deciding that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who seem just like us really are</v>

69
00:04:28.521 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>

70
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.390
<v Speaker 2>They're really so different that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>count as of them.</v>

71
00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fabulous study showing this,</v>

72
00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:39.091
<v Speaker 2>this double edged quality to oxytocin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was a study done by a group in</v>

73
00:04:39.191 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands and what they did was</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took Dutch university student</v>

74
00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 2>volunteers and they gave him classic</v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy problem.</v>

75
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 2>The runaway trolley problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it okay to sacrifice one person to</v>

76
00:04:51.641 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 2>save five runaway trolley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you push this big beefy guy onto the</v>

77
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>track who gets squashed by the trolley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that slows it down so that five</v>

78
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 2>people tied to the attractive standard</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem at philosophy,</v>

79
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>utilitarianism and justifies means all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>

80
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:12.130
<v Speaker 2>So you give people the scenario and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have varying opinions and now you</v>

81
00:05:12.131 --> 00:05:17.131
<v Speaker 2>give them the scenario where the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>you push onto the track has a name and</v>

82
00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.610
<v Speaker 2>either it's a standard name from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands.</v>

83
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:24.070
<v Speaker 2>Dirk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think who's like a peer to peer or</v>

84
00:05:24.071 --> 00:05:25.570
<v Speaker 2>something which like if you're.</v>

85
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 2>This is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a meat and potatoes Netherlandish</v>

86
00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 2>name or a name from either of two groups</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evoke lots of Zena phobic hostility</v>

87
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 2>among people from the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone with a typically German name.</v>

88
00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>World War II.</v>

89
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.580
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a problem.</v>

90
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.760
<v Speaker 2>Or someone with a typically Muslim name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now they're choosing whether to save</v>

91
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:52.801
<v Speaker 2>five by pushing dirt onto the track or</v>
<v Speaker 2>auto or Mahmoud and in general give them</v>

92
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>those names and there's no difference in</v>
<v Speaker 2>how people would rate it.</v>

93
00:05:57.411 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>Then if they were anonymous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give people oxytocin where they don't</v>

94
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 2>know that they've gotten it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Controlled group has just placebo spurts</v>

95
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:09.340
<v Speaker 2>up their nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give people oxytocin and Kumbaya.</v>

96
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.050
<v Speaker 2>You were far less likely to push dirt</v>
<v Speaker 2>onto the track and dirk is add,</v>

97
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:19.270
<v Speaker 2>you are now far more likely to push good</v>
<v Speaker 2>old auto or good old mom onto the rails</v>

98
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>there and you are more likely to</v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice an out group member to save</v>

99
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:27.410
<v Speaker 2>five and you're less likely to sacrifice</v>
<v Speaker 2>an ingroup member.</v>

100
00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 2>All you've done there is exaggerate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>US than divide with that.</v>
