1
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>The work of stellar archaeology really</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to the heart of the,</v>

2
00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>we are star dust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.740
<v Speaker 1>when we are children off the stars</v>
<v Speaker 1>statement,</v>

4
00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>you've probably heard it all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does it actually mean?</v>

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>We are mostly made all humans and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>life forms that,</v>

6
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>that we know off made mostly of carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bunch of other elements,</v>

7
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>but in much lesser quantities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where does this carbon come from?</v>

8
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:31.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.580
<v Speaker 1>you could say it comes from the earth</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

10
00:00:34.581 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how did it get into the earth?</v>

11
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that is where astronomy comes in</v>

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.590
<v Speaker 1>because there are multiple so-called</v>
<v Speaker 1>nucleo synthesis processes that creates,</v>

13
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elements,</v>

14
00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>heavy elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are fused lighter ones into heavier</v>

15
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starting with hydrogen for four hydrogen</v>

16
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:02.681
<v Speaker 1>atoms come together and fuse into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>helium atom and a few throw helium,</v>

17
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 1>three helium atoms together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a carbon nucleus and a,</v>

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>this is how carbon is created and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

19
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing how much carbon was created</v>

20
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.510
<v Speaker 1>at various times in the universe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>through which processes and through</v>

21
00:01:20.511 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in which types of stars.</v>

22
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.541
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:23.541 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>in what evolutionaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>phases of the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all happens.</v>

25
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>And so this is how we can piece together</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chemical evolution of the universe</v>

26
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>that is really the basis for any</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological evolution to take place on</v>

27
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

28
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:44.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find it really exciting to,</v>

29
00:01:44.721 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go back and really look at the,</v>

30
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>at the constituents of life separately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we have studied not just carbon but</v>

31
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:57.761
<v Speaker 1>also nitrogen and phosphorous and sulfur</v>
<v Speaker 1>and oxygen and iron and all the</v>

32
00:01:58.581 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>different elements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

33
00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>through our work and sell archeology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And actually if you come to think about</v>

34
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wa,</v>

35
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.291
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

36
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:06.890
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>the body is not just made of carbon but</v>
<v Speaker 1>also a lot of water and there is</v>

38
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.650
<v Speaker 1>hydrogen and oxygen in the water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a while we know oxygen also comes</v>

39
00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.200
<v Speaker 1>from the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You add another helium nucleus to a</v>

40
00:02:21.201 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>carbon nucleus and you get an oxygen</v>
<v Speaker 1>nucleus.</v>

41
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>But the water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hydrogen protons,</v>

43
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.490
<v Speaker 1>they were all formed in the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we actually carry about 10% of our</v>

44
00:02:33.681 --> 00:02:35.480
<v Speaker 1>body weight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in us that that is big bang material.</v>

46
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>The protons were all recycle up numerous</v>
<v Speaker 1>times throughout the stars.</v>

47
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual protons were made in the</v>

48
00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>hot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Bang when all the subatomic</v>

49
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:51.800
<v Speaker 1>particles actually came together and</v>
<v Speaker 1>formed protons and neutrons.</v>

50
00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>And so that we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not just children off the stars.</v>

51
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are also children off of the Big Bang</v>

52
00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>and think it's really nice once in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while too,</v>

53
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:06.190
<v Speaker 1>to reflect on that and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really realize how much we are</v>

54
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>actually connected to the cosmos.</v>
