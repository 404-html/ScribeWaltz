1
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>I resist the notion that somehow China</v>
<v Speaker 1>is special or different from every other</v>

2
00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.180
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except in the obvious sense that every</v>

3
00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>country has some unique characteristics</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of Chinese history.</v>

4
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.170
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think perhaps a lot of people in the</v>

5
00:00:22.171 --> 00:00:27.171
<v Speaker 1>West don't realize that you only have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go back to about 1800 to find that China</v>

6
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>was the largest economy in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>its per capita income was not</v>

7
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:34.350
<v Speaker 1>significantly different from western</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

8
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so China was a major economic power.</v>

9
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>China was a developed country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go back further to about 1400,</v>

10
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China had a major navy.</v>

11
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.390
<v Speaker 1>It was exploring as far as Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.770
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China was a global power throughout much</v>

13
00:00:49.771 --> 00:00:53.670
<v Speaker 1>of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then starting sometime around 1800,</v>

14
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:55.830
<v Speaker 1>we can argue about the exact date.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:55.831 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>China went into a period of decline</v>
<v Speaker 1>largely I think because it cut itself</v>

16
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 1>off from the rest of the world.</v>

17
00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>So it stopped having those benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange with other countries,</v>

18
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:07.120
<v Speaker 1>which are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are important for,</v>

19
00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>for technological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced and prosperity.</v>

20
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>So I think Chinese people have a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a pride,</v>

21
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about their past and they're in some</v>

22
00:01:17.101 --> 00:01:19.260
<v Speaker 1>sense embarrassed at the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>really declined and became extremely</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor in the 20th century.</v>

24
00:01:23.641 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had the Japanese invasion,</v>

25
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:28.640
<v Speaker 1>you had different European powers taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>little pieces of China's.</v>

26
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:29.790
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Chinese people have a very</v>

28
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:36.450
<v Speaker 1>strong drive to return to what they see</v>
<v Speaker 1>is their rightful place in the world,</v>

29
00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:40.590
<v Speaker 1>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major economic and cultural political</v>

30
00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.424
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>

31
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Mao was fairly effective</v>

32
00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.461
<v Speaker 1>political leader during a period where</v>
<v Speaker 1>China was trying to unify the country,</v>

33
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>fight the Japanese and expelled them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expelled the European colonial powers.</v>

35
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.320
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of controversy about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.040
<v Speaker 1>who played what role exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not the best expert to,</v>

37
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>to be interviewed on the details of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of the 1920s in 1930s.</v>

39
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I think the important point is most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in mainland China think that Mao</v>

40
00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:20.630
<v Speaker 1>played a very important role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>reunifying the country and putting</v>

41
00:02:20.631 --> 00:02:22.640
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of first step in bringing</v>

42
00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>China back as a world power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

43
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 1>I think most people in mainland China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>think that he was a very poor day to day</v>
<v Speaker 1>manager and after the country was</v>

45
00:02:35.331 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>unified in 1949,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a series of quite disastrous</v>

46
00:02:39.981 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly on the economic front.</v>

47
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great leap forward generated a huge</v>

48
00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.960
<v Speaker 1>famine in which tends of millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people died.</v>

49
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 1>A cultural revolution was a disaster for</v>
<v Speaker 1>most Chinese people.</v>

50
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 1>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's fair to say that by the</v>

52
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:59.210
<v Speaker 1>early 1970s there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China certainly was extremely,</v>

53
00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>we know it was poor than Subsaharan</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and I think there was a lot of</v>

54
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.870
<v Speaker 1>resentment on the part of ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 1>people about the condition and to which</v>

55
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>the country had fallen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there was a lot of popular support</v>

56
00:03:11.471 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>for some kind of change of direction and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dung Sao paying I think was very</v>

57
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>effective in channeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that energy,</v>

58
00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quite quickly bringing about almost</v>

59
00:03:21.491 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>180 degree change in economic policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

60
00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's really interesting laboratory in</v>

61
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.171
<v Speaker 1>a sense that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>the same people in the same culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>went down a disastrous road in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties and seventies,</v>

64
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:38.410
<v Speaker 1>and just got poorer and poorer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people starve to death.</v>

65
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And then with a few key changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic policy,</v>

66
00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>the same people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same geography,</v>

67
00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.530
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden they start growing at</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to 10% per year.</v>

68
00:03:47.531 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very powerful example of what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can do with economic policy.</v>

69
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

70
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:56.380
<v Speaker 1>remembering that the underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions are quite important.</v>

71
00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.910
<v Speaker 1>And I think China had a long history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective government.</v>

72
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>It had pretty substantial history of</v>
<v Speaker 1>private property rights.</v>

73
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>If you go back far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a long history as a trading</v>

74
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think those things reside in</v>

75
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>people's memories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And once in a country like China,</v>

76
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 1>once you shift policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>toward strengthening property rights and</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up the economy,</v>

78
00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>you get really impressive results very</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
