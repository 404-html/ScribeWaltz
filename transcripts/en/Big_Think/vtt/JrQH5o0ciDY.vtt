00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.290
<v Speaker 1>We ran into a tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>when I was four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my one year old sister died suddenly</v>

3
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>from croup form of pneumonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

4
00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and she was my mother's</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to be born again,</v>

5
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:32.660
<v Speaker 1>you might say through her daughter</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's great.</v>

6
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>Wives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lived very tough lives giving how their</v>

7
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>husbands were working and when she lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>her beloved daughter,</v>

8
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>she went into very deep mourning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

9
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a child who normally</v>

10
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>thinks we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we think of ourselves as the</v>

11
00:00:55.881 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>center of the solar system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything revolves around us.</v>

12
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>We're responsible for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wondered why as my mother</v>

13
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.080
<v Speaker 1>withdrew and to the deepest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deepest depression psychologically what</v>

14
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:17.621
<v Speaker 1>I did to cause her to abandon me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>added to my complexities,</v>

15
00:01:19.911 --> 00:01:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I guess you'd say I formed a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

16
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>a pattern of having to achieve and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having to be perfect so I could somehow</v>

17
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 1>regained her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

18
00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>her affection and her attention and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's had some good points and had some</v>

19
00:01:39.681 --> 00:01:44.681
<v Speaker 1>bad points because trying to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection can be a productive.</v>

20
00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It can also be a very destructive</v>
<v Speaker 1>process after awhile.</v>

21
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.760
<v Speaker 1>So she had quite an impact on me.</v>
