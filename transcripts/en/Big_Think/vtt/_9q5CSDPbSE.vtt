00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Do an interview with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chuck Feeney with a billionaire who gave</v>

2
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 1>away all of his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.200
<v Speaker 1>molly and he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

4
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 1>he did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it.</v>

5
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:27.163
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I brought them onto the sales survival </v>

6
00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.760
<v Speaker 1>school for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the artists language,</v>

7
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>and I was trying to encourage him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give some money to it.</v>

8
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And when we released,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said to me this was,</v>

9
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:39.734
<v Speaker 1>this was this good where parents had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>financed by running ruffles and know </v>

10
00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.243
<v Speaker 1>there that will sort of fundraising </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects and the kids were all in this </v>

11
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:53.084
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this big hall and they were getting a </v>

12
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:55.883
<v Speaker 1>brilliant education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's had the baby when we went </v>

13
00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.470
<v Speaker 1>through the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought he was hiding impressed by</v>

14
00:00:59.471 --> 00:00:59.871
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

15
00:00:59.871 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to give them any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

16
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they said,</v>

17
00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're doing very well,</v>

18
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps if I give them money they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do as well.</v>

19
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>So I would take a leaf from his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>experience of philanthropy and put it </v>
<v Speaker 1>into sustainable projects.</v>
