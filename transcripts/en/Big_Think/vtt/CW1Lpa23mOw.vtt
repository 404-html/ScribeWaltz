1
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker 1>The word theory can be used to mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>something speculative and tentative in</v>

2
00:00:12.921 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 1>everyday speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably usually is used in that</v>

3
00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:17.990
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'll just very often use it in a much</v>

4
00:00:17.991 --> 00:00:21.110
<v Speaker 1>more positive sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the easiest ways to use the</v>

5
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:25.250
<v Speaker 1>ordinary language word fact in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ordinary language sense of the word fact</v>

6
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.280
<v Speaker 1>evolution is a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The evidence that makes it a fat is</v>

7
00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>partly fossil evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.290
<v Speaker 1>partly competitive comparative evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at modern species and comparing</v>

9
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>their bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their organs,</v>

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker 1>their structures generally and</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially their molecules that genes at</v>

11
00:00:45.621 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>a molecular level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is extremely persuasive and</v>

12
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>powerful evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You compare the,</v>

13
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.660
<v Speaker 1>the genes of animals and plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You find that they,</v>

14
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.900
<v Speaker 1>the pattern of resemblance is a tree of</v>
<v Speaker 1>branching tree,</v>

15
00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>and that branching tree could only be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>family tree.</v>

16
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Other very persuasive evidence is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The geographical distribution of animals</v>

17
00:01:08.871 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>and plants on islands and continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are exactly where we should expect</v>

18
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 1>them to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If evolution were a factor.</v>
