00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.860
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Stephanie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ask a great question,</v>

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 2>how likely is it that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find life on a planet outside the Earth</v>

4
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 2>in your lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say in the next 40 or 50 years?</v>

5
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 2>And of course this is something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody can answer.</v>

6
00:00:21.571 --> 00:00:22.830
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>

7
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the answer,</v>

8
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's very likely indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now when I say life,</v>

9
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of ways you can take that</v>
<v Speaker 2>word.</v>

10
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really talking about</v>

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.520
<v Speaker 2>civilizations or spaceships or things</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

12
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.640
<v Speaker 2>I think it's much more likely that we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to find microbes,</v>

13
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 2>simple life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But to me that would be really,</v>

14
00:00:41.281 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 2>really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are several places in our own</v>

15
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 2>solar system right now that we think</v>
<v Speaker 2>might be good environments for life,</v>

16
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 2>and as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't found proof of life yet,</v>

17
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 2>but we've found some very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very interesting things.</v>

18
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on Mars,</v>

19
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 2>Mars has an atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much thinner than the earth's,</v>

20
00:00:58.501 --> 00:01:01.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's still there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We think there might even be water</v>

21
00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 2>underneath the surface of Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And recently we've detected organic</v>

22
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>molecules which are sort of the building</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks of our chemistry on Mars as well.</v>

23
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.660
<v Speaker 2>It's possible that the surface of Mars</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself is not a very good place for</v>

24
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:15.660
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe underneath meters under the</v>

25
00:01:15.661 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 2>soil in the rock you could find bacteria</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there are a lot of analogs to this</v>

26
00:01:20.401 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 2>on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Similar things on earth,</v>

27
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 2>we find bacteria that can exist as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mild under the earth.</v>

28
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.620
<v Speaker 2>We find these things in gold mines very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very deep under the earth.</v>

29
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 2>You break open the rocks and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually bacteria living in the rocks</v>

30
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.390
<v Speaker 2>very far down into the earth and there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are other places in the outer solar</v>

31
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 2>system that we think are great</v>
<v Speaker 2>environments for life too.</v>

32
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 2>There are moons of Jupiter and Saturn</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we know have liquid water oceans.</v>

33
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europa is a moon of Jupiter and we know</v>

34
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 2>that your rope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has vast reservoirs of liquid water</v>

35
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.860
<v Speaker 2>that are protected by a shell of ice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

36
00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 2>this one moon of Jupiter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europa actually has far more liquid</v>

37
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 2>water on it than earth does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there are some suggestions that</v>

38
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 2>there might be interesting chemistry as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

39
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 2>There's also a moon of Saturn called</v>
<v Speaker 2>enceladus and the same thing applies.</v>

40
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 2>There's a liquid water ocean under ice</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the case of enceladus you</v>

41
00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 2>actually have cracks in the ice that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water is flying out of and turning into</v>

42
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:16.800
<v Speaker 2>ice crystals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually flew our Cassini spacecraft</v>

43
00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 2>through these jets coming out of</v>
<v Speaker 2>enceladus and we detected organic</v>

44
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 2>molecules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we know that there is warm salt</v>

45
00:02:23.581 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's interesting chemistry.</v>

46
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a great place to go looking for</v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

47
00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's another moon of Saturn to</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Titan,</v>

48
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.460
<v Speaker 2>which is very different from that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>has an atmosphere.</v>

49
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.890
<v Speaker 2>We actually think that there are lakes</v>
<v Speaker 2>of methane,</v>

50
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.020
<v Speaker 2>not water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually liquid methane on the</v>

51
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 2>surface.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And below that there's probably liquid</v>

52
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 2>water underneath.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have liquid water,</v>

53
00:02:42.781 --> 00:02:44.850
<v Speaker 2>you have organics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have an atmosphere.</v>

54
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that'd be a great place to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for some microbes.</v>

55
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 2>So some people say that's not very</v>
<v Speaker 2>exciting.</v>

56
00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to find aliens in the</v>

57
00:02:52.891 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 2>sense of spaceships and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cling ons and any science fiction you</v>

58
00:02:56.611 --> 00:02:57.870
<v Speaker 2>want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

59
00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 2>for one though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be very excited when we</v>

60
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>find any evidence of life outside the</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

61
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a bottle of champagne</v>
<v Speaker 2>chilling because I think it could happen</v>

62
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 2>almost any day when some of our rovers</v>
<v Speaker 2>or some of our satellites around other</v>

63
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.160
<v Speaker 2>planets come back with really</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting data.</v>

64
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Think about the questions we can answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does life,</v>

65
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 2>even if it's at a bacteria level of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's just a tiny little bit of</v>

66
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does it have DNA?</v>

67
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Is it similar to us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it different from us?</v>

68
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.550
<v Speaker 2>We finally have the next example of how</v>
<v Speaker 2>life can form and how life can evolve</v>

69
00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 2>and our view of the universe will never</v>
<v Speaker 2>be the same again.</v>

70
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>And my bet is that's going to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the next 50 years.</v>
