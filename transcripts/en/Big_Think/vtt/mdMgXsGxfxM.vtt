00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I wrote the best intentions out of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>low points</v>

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.750
<v Speaker 2>in American UN relations and immediate</v>
<v Speaker 2>period after Iraq and so forth,</v>

3
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 2>and that things are better than they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were.</v>

4
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I also think the UN has gotten</v>
<v Speaker 2>marginalized in a lot of ways and</v>

5
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 2>partially because of the Bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration,</v>

6
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we sent an ambassador there,</v>

7
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 2>John Bolton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was very hostile to the institution</v>

8
00:00:30.491 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 2>that reduced America's own role,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Air America zone.</v>

9
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also had the chief hand in choosing</v>

10
00:00:38.051 --> 00:00:42.790
<v Speaker 2>the Secretary General Ban Ki Moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now ban Ki Moon is not quite two years</v>

11
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:47.791
<v Speaker 2>into his five year term.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it is possible that he will prove to</v>

12
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 2>be a more forceful figure than he has so</v>
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>

13
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>But certainly the impression one gets is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the United States chose them</v>

14
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:57.130
<v Speaker 2>because they thought he would be an</v>
<v Speaker 2>inoffensive pro-american figure.</v>

15
00:00:57.131 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 2>And that's what he's been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's been an inoffensive pro American</v>

16
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if we actually want the UN to</v>

17
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.450
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we have to choose it's chief</v>

18
00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 2>executive for his competence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not for his harmlessness.</v>

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so it's just troubling that we have</v>

20
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 2>not sought to use this institution in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way that it can be used.</v>

21
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:17.590
<v Speaker 2>And I would hope that Obama,</v>

22
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>we'll take it more seriously.</v>
