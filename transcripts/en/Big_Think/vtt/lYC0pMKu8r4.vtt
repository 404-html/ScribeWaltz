1
00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:09.703
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.470
<v Speaker 1>it's more of a great philosophy that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a Moira,</v>

3
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.580
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot in life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and aristotle taught us that you take</v>

4
00:00:19.921 --> 00:00:22.530
<v Speaker 1>your Moyer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of realize where it is.</v>

5
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Can you try to fill it up as much as you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can?</v>

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle also taught a very good lesson</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people like naturally there's</v>

7
00:00:31.661 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>something inherent in human beings about</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to perfect whatever you do,</v>

8
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>you need tries to understand why this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

9
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get added.</v>

10
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.060
<v Speaker 1>But he says it's clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like to perfect what they do.</v>

11
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Then the second is far more even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>insightful.</v>

12
00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>And that is people like to perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated subjects more than easy</v>

13
00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in a very simple analogy,</v>

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>no one becomes a fanatic on checkers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen somebody say,</v>

15
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.990
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love checkers.</v>

16
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I just think of checkers all the time.</v>

17
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.810
<v Speaker 1>It's a simple game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 1>but chess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find lots of fanatics in chess,</v>

19
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>their whole life revolves around chest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

20
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Because just as complicated and so they</v>
<v Speaker 1>to perfect,</v>

21
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:20.451
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that there is a great</v>

22
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:25.551
<v Speaker 1>attraction to taking something hard like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare or like understanding the</v>

23
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:31.761
<v Speaker 1>arts and try to perfect that rather than</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes up the simple and perfecting that.</v>

24
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>That's why a musicians are so stretched</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

25
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:37.441
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to be a very good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just anybody in the arts is stress a</v>

27
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stretch a lot because it's complicated</v>

28
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aristotle would tell you that's what</v>

29
00:01:47.701 --> 00:01:52.220
<v Speaker 1>makes it so much fun and it makes it</v>
<v Speaker 1>very frustrating because a,</v>

30
00:01:52.221 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>there's not much margin for error there.</v>
