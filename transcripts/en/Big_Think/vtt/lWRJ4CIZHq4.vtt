1
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.110
<v Speaker 2>I like to think of innovation as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

3
00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:13.111
<v Speaker 2>It's a process of transforming new ideas</v>
<v Speaker 2>into tangible societal impact and so</v>

4
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.140
<v Speaker 2>that means that it's not enough to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a new idea,</v>

5
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's really important for that idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make an impact,</v>

6
00:00:21.641 --> 00:00:23.110
<v Speaker 2>to scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow,</v>

7
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 2>to touch many peoples' lives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly it can create financial</v>

8
00:00:27.641 --> 00:00:31.270
<v Speaker 2>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also creates social wealth,</v>

9
00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.160
<v Speaker 2>social capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human capital,</v>

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.800
<v Speaker 2>and so it's really important to look at</v>
<v Speaker 2>it from that whole perspective.</v>

11
00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 2>Right now we're in a very challenging</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation and obviously,</v>

12
00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 2>and everyone's wondering where the next</v>
<v Speaker 2>job's going to come from and absolutely</v>

13
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 2>new jobs are going to have to come from</v>
<v Speaker 2>new businesses and new products and</v>

14
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 2>those come from from new ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you do incremental innovation,</v>

15
00:00:51.221 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you might grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a little bit of a economic growth,</v>

16
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.170
<v Speaker 2>but it's the real fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 2>groundbreaking ideas that create whole</v>

17
00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:00.820
<v Speaker 2>new sectors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the internet or</v>

18
00:01:00.821 --> 00:01:04.660
<v Speaker 2>biotechnology or now green technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a water technology,</v>

19
00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.550
<v Speaker 2>and there's some real needs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges in the world.</v>

20
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 2>Grand challenges that will also only be</v>
<v Speaker 2>solved with some serious innovation.</v>

21
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people think that economic</v>
<v Speaker 2>downturns time to really buckle down and</v>

22
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.110
<v Speaker 2>look within and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

23
00:01:23.111 --> 00:01:25.360
<v Speaker 2>there's not going to be any</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities.</v>

24
00:01:25.361 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is that during an</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic downturn,</v>

25
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 2>that could be some of the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities for individuals,</v>

26
00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs and companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

27
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 2>the majority of the Dao,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the companies in the Dow,</v>

28
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 2>we're funded or were founded in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic downturn,</v>

29
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.680
<v Speaker 2>a Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cisco,</v>

30
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caterpillar,</v>

31
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 2>a tons of companies that have really</v>
<v Speaker 2>seized an opportunity.</v>

32
00:01:50.111 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And part of that is because you don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a situation where everyone wants to</v>

33
00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 2>get into the game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

34
00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone says,</v>

35
00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.920
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's my turn to make a buck.</v>

36
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 2>And A,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not really serious about the</v>

37
00:02:02.051 --> 00:02:04.870
<v Speaker 2>passion of their idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really the best,</v>

38
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only people that are really resourceful</v>

39
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 2>and see a real opportunity and jump in</v>
<v Speaker 2>there probably are going to survive.</v>

40
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 2>But it's a real opportunity for those</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas to flourish.</v>

41
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 2>And it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some ways it might be more</v>

42
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:23.500
<v Speaker 2>challenging to start a company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time it can be easier</v>

43
00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:26.020
<v Speaker 2>because the rents are cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The talents cheap.</v>

44
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.800
<v Speaker 2>You don't have as much competition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>others jumping into the market,</v>

45
00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 2>so there's some positive sides for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneur as well.</v>

46
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.510
<v Speaker 2>Universities have historically been a</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge source of innovation for the</v>

47
00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:46.791
<v Speaker 2>country and in fact there was a study</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was done recently a couple of years</v>

48
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.110
<v Speaker 2>ago that looked at the r and d,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,</v>

49
00:02:49.111 --> 00:02:54.111
<v Speaker 2>which is the hundred most significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovations of the year as defined by R</v>

50
00:02:54.961 --> 00:02:59.320
<v Speaker 2>and d magazine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what was interesting,</v>

51
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:04.240
<v Speaker 2>they looked over the last 30 or more</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of historically speaking,</v>

52
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.250
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at about 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 20 slash 25,</v>

53
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about 70 percent of the most significant</v>

54
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>innovations had found their initial idea</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a private in the private sector and</v>

55
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 2>industry had funded it exclusively and</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's completely flipped.</v>

56
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:28.771
<v Speaker 2>So 70 percent our fund are founded or</v>
<v Speaker 2>developed using public funding</v>

57
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 2>universities and a federal labs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an example of,</v>

58
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 2>or a demonstration of something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people have been saying for a little</v>

59
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 2>while now is that you just don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bell labs and Xerox,</v>

60
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>Xerox Parks and industry to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the really fundamental research</v>

61
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 2>that's going to be creating the</v>
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough ideas of the next,</v>

62
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the next generation.</v>

63
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 2>So universities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

64
00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.903
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

65
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.630
<v Speaker 2>they really form a nexus of innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>ecosystems and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're the source of the real</v>

67
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>breakthrough ideas that we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be in eating and innovation.</v>

68
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>One thing that I'm very passionate about</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think is really important for</v>

69
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:20.341
<v Speaker 2>people to understand is every year in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country we spend taxpayers,</v>

70
00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 2>the federal government spends $50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars a year on university</v>

71
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's absolutely critical because</v>

72
00:04:28.511 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 2>that's where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new ideas are going to be coming</v>

73
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 2>from and the real breakthroughs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

74
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.570
<v Speaker 2>however we spent $50,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars a year on research,</v>

75
00:04:37.571 --> 00:04:41.440
<v Speaker 2>but we spend almost nothing on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs in universities to get those</v>

76
00:04:41.441 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 2>ideas out into the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite that,</v>

77
00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 2>we still,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a study by the Association of</v>

78
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 2>university technology managers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>autumn,</v>

79
00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.530
<v Speaker 2>the latest study from 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do a survey every year show that,</v>

80
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there've been,</v>

81
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over 600 new products that are developed</v>

82
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 2>that were developed that year and almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>600 startups have spun out of</v>

83
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 2>university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

84
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:12.361
<v Speaker 2>intellectual property and there's about</v>
<v Speaker 2>3,300 university spin outs that are in</v>

85
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.490
<v Speaker 2>business today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

86
00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.240
<v Speaker 2>it's despite the fact that we're not</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in it,</v>

87
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:23.080
<v Speaker 2>it is happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not happening at nearly the</v>

88
00:05:23.081 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 2>rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've seen it with my own eyes that</v>

89
00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:29.140
<v Speaker 2>there are things that are sitting on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelves and sitting in the labs that are</v>

90
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>not seeing the light of day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that it's really in large</v>

91
00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 2>part because of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a big gap between the university</v>

92
00:05:36.401 --> 00:05:37.234
<v Speaker 2>in the market.</v>

93
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Well first you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

94
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 2>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that gap?</v>

95
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people talk about something</v>
<v Speaker 2>called the valley of death and it's</v>

96
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:54.160
<v Speaker 2>primarily seen as a funding gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some really interesting ideas in</v>

97
00:05:54.161 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 2>the lab,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just they're a little bit too far</v>

98
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 2>removed from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the private sector is willing to</v>

99
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>invest in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we need to do a proof of concept to</v>

100
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:09.401
<v Speaker 2>show that these ideas will actually work</v>
<v Speaker 2>for specific market needs to address,</v>

101
00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.880
<v Speaker 2>to address specific market needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

102
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 2>and so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one need.</v>

103
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the angel investors,</v>

104
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 2>venture capitalists are not filling that</v>
<v Speaker 2>gap and I'm not sure that it really</v>

105
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:24.330
<v Speaker 2>isn't appropriate for them to be filling</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gap because these are not ready for</v>

106
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.630
<v Speaker 2>it to be a startup or a product yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

107
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's also a cultural gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the university,</v>

108
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:32.051
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

109
00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the motivations are how do I support my</v>

110
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 2>students and how do I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

111
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 2>how do I get the next research grant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do I raise my reputation as the</v>

112
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.440
<v Speaker 2>expert in this field?</v>

113
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas in the private sector,</v>

114
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:48.420
<v Speaker 2>of course it's about revenues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>profits and,</v>

115
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.170
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are completely appropriate</v>

116
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.220
<v Speaker 2>motivations for the two groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in another way I like to think</v>

117
00:06:55.221 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 2>about it as an academia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprises are good,</v>

118
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 2>but in industry not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

119
00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was definitely a big cultural gap and</v>

120
00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 2>what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

121
00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 2>what we don't want to do is we don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to try to turn academics into</v>

122
00:07:07.611 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>business people and we certainly are not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get business people to try to</v>

123
00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>become academics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but will we need to do is to help</v>

124
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:15.420
<v Speaker 2>connect them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

125
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:20.450
<v Speaker 2>and help connect the two cultures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>enable them to learn about each other</v>

126
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 2>and what motivates them so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>speak each other's language.</v>

127
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.540
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

128
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really about the bridging and</v>

129
00:07:30.201 --> 00:07:31.580
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about teaching.</v>

130
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 2>So we've had some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

131
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the country have been some</v>

132
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:43.871
<v Speaker 2>success successes with innovation</v>
<v Speaker 2>centers and proof of concept funds and</v>

133
00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a greater focus on tech transfer and on</v>

134
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurship education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have a proposal that I wrote</v>

135
00:07:53.751 --> 00:07:58.751
<v Speaker 2>with the support of many others that as</v>
<v Speaker 2>called the impact proposal.</v>

136
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:02.720
<v Speaker 2>It was at the urging of the White House</v>
<v Speaker 2>Office of Science and Technology Policy.</v>

137
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we help bridge this gap?</v>

138
00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:10.280
<v Speaker 2>And the idea behind it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start with a pilot program,</v>

139
00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:15.430
<v Speaker 2>a $20,000,000 pilot program where a</v>
<v Speaker 2>handful of universities would be</v>

140
00:08:15.741 --> 00:08:20.741
<v Speaker 2>selected to develop these programs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation programs to provide small</v>

141
00:08:21.801 --> 00:08:26.801
<v Speaker 2>proof of concept grants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>50 $100,000 to faculty and students to</v>

142
00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 2>provide mentoring for the faculty and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the students and,</v>

143
00:08:31.161 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provide some educational resources and</v>

144
00:08:33.681 --> 00:08:37.490
<v Speaker 2>connections to the outside community and</v>
<v Speaker 2>really build ecosystems around these</v>

145
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 2>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's built on,</v>

146
00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

147
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 2>it's worked before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to help build it into a best</v>

148
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.460
<v Speaker 2>practice that others can build on.</v>

149
00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 2>And ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully the federal government would</v>

150
00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 2>see that there is a value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible value that would pay back in</v>

151
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many fold that so would be worth</v>

152
00:08:58.651 --> 00:09:01.490
<v Speaker 2>investing in this process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The PR and the,</v>

153
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:04.250
<v Speaker 2>the local capacity around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

154
00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:09.251
<v Speaker 2>So the university's would serve as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>nexus of these innovation ecosystems.</v>

155
00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.740
<v Speaker 2>And I think that universities are</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly well suited to serve as</v>

156
00:09:13.741 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>that nexus because not only are</v>
<v Speaker 2>universities creating some of the most</v>

157
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 2>exciting ground breaking technologies</v>
<v Speaker 2>and ideas already.</v>

158
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're also incredibly situated with,</v>

159
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of alumni that</v>

160
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:30.180
<v Speaker 2>want to get involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have brands,</v>

161
00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 2>local,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

162
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 2>interest in the local community and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also really good conveners because</v>

163
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.520
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have any private interest or</v>

164
00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:43.230
<v Speaker 2>any particular bias and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're also incredibly good at</v>

165
00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.470
<v Speaker 2>educating people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>

166
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.710
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be,</v>

167
00:09:46.711 --> 00:09:51.480
<v Speaker 2>that's a really powerful role.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And up until now universities have,</v>

168
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main focus of the university is the</v>

169
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:58.220
<v Speaker 2>creation and dissemination of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is it.</v>

170
00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.210
<v Speaker 2>This is an extension of that already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

171
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important mission to the point</v>

172
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:05.970
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we disseminate that knowledge to</v>

173
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.740
<v Speaker 2>make greater societal impact?</v>

174
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the 2008 item survey.</v>

175
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

176
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 2>they surveyed all the universities and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the assault spinouts that have been</v>

177
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:22.320
<v Speaker 2>created out of university intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>property and uh,</v>

178
00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 2>and this does not include,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be clear either the student startups</v>

179
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:30.741
<v Speaker 2>and other startups that may be created</v>
<v Speaker 2>not based on intellectual property that</v>

180
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

181
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:35.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>72 percent of startups that spin out of</v>

182
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:40.410
<v Speaker 2>universities stay local within the state</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the university.</v>

183
00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:45.830
<v Speaker 2>So it has a huge economic impact and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also because of that ecosystem</v>

184
00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:49.640
<v Speaker 2>feeling indeed can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've seen it happen when I,</v>

185
00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 2>when I was at mit and now that I'm at</v>
<v Speaker 2>USC to have these and promote the ideas</v>

186
00:10:56.731 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 2>that are within the university in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>programmatic fashion.</v>

187
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:03.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very successful way,</v>

188
00:11:03.001 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 2>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very effective way of getting alumni</v>

189
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 2>involved and getting the local business</v>
<v Speaker 2>community involved within the university</v>

190
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:12.990
<v Speaker 2>and come together and then meet each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

191
00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>So it snowballs and it just becomes much</v>
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

192
00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.520
<v Speaker 2>becomes a really vibrant community.</v>

193
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.050
<v Speaker 2>Many people have asked me whether is</v>
<v Speaker 2>this just appropriate for a elite</v>

194
00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.540
<v Speaker 2>universities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's absolutely not,</v>

195
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not the case because,</v>

196
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:30.061
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

197
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:35.061
<v Speaker 2>any university either that does research</v>
<v Speaker 2>or has students that are,</v>

198
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.440
<v Speaker 2>have some sort of entrepreneurial</v>
<v Speaker 2>inclination would really be better,</v>

199
00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>would be well served to be trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>increase that,</v>

200
00:11:45.001 --> 00:11:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that type of inactivity in the case of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller university that might have a</v>

201
00:11:48.871 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 2>smaller research budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

202
00:11:50.851 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can band together to a greater</v>

203
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:55.230
<v Speaker 2>critical mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

204
00:11:55.231 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 2>if a friend of mine who's heading up</v>
<v Speaker 2>tech transfer at Brandeis University in</v>

205
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:02.350
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's working with other universities in</v>

206
00:12:02.351 --> 00:12:07.351
<v Speaker 2>that area to create a consortium so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can work together and have that,</v>

207
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:12.070
<v Speaker 2>have a much larger research base to</v>
<v Speaker 2>attract more individuals to that,</v>

208
00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.400
<v Speaker 2>to that group so that there's definitely</v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunities for any university to</v>

209
00:12:18.701 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 2>participate in this sort of activity.</v>

210
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:22.310
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

211
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 2>the reality is there have been studies</v>
<v Speaker 2>that show that the more</v>

212
00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.280
<v Speaker 2>basic and the more groundbreaking the</v>
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>

213
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:35.850
<v Speaker 2>the more effective tech transfer and</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation there is from the university.</v>

214
00:12:36.371 --> 00:12:41.371
<v Speaker 2>So I would encourage those universities</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not give up the roots of doing some</v>

215
00:12:42.551 --> 00:12:45.940
<v Speaker 2>really basic research because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bit of a temptation to say,</v>

216
00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:46.451
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

217
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:50.430
<v Speaker 2>we only have a small research base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to move as much of it into</v>

218
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.890
<v Speaker 2>applied research as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's absolutely not,</v>

219
00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:57.430
<v Speaker 2>would not be the right approach if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really trying to make some</v>

220
00:12:57.431 --> 00:12:58.960
<v Speaker 2>groundbreaking innovations.</v>
