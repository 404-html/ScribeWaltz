1
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>They'll shaft writer Aquarius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 1>actually the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:17.651 --> 00:00:20.440
<v Speaker 1>I was always a funny and my family is</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

4
00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:23.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm the fifth of six children from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>large Jewish family.</v>

5
00:00:23.651 --> 00:00:26.110
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was never enough guilt to go around.</v>

6
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was 18 I was at deerfield academy</v>

7
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.840
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and a few of my friends,</v>

8
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.140
<v Speaker 1>we might have stolen a faculty member's</v>
<v Speaker 1>car and we drove into North Hampton and</v>

9
00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I did seven minutes of standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly stolen material at a bar called</v>

10
00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>the early times and from the ages of 18</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 22,</v>

11
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:51.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I probably performed twice a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

12
00:00:51.881 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>I wanted my undergraduate talent show</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

13
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>at Harvard doing stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was always something I knew I</v>

14
00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:01.840
<v Speaker 1>could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always like a hobby with me,</v>

15
00:01:01.841 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>but I always had the feeling that if the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nut came to crunch a,</v>

16
00:01:05.081 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>I could make a little money at it.</v>

17
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>But I majored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I majored in Latin at Harvard because I</v>

18
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:12.790
<v Speaker 1>thought the church was going to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

19
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.010
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:01:15.011 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where I majored</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Latin and Greek because I loved,</v>

21
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>that was the only thing I really was</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in academically.</v>

22
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:25.390
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the best preparation for a</v>

23
00:01:25.391 --> 00:01:29.740
<v Speaker 1>writer because it teaches you the value</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a word and of the word.</v>

24
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I went to Harvard fully intending to</v>

25
00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>be either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.010
<v Speaker 1>a Latin teacher or a pharmacist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:39.011 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

28
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>what can you do with a classics degree?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm a,</v>

29
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.120
<v Speaker 1>I ended up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I got a c minus in.</v>

30
00:01:46.121 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a graduate course my freshman</v>
<v Speaker 1>year in Hurghada this.</v>

31
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>And then I turned my sites to becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sports writer.</v>

32
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that for awhile and then I became,</v>

33
00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 1>I was a standup comic for 13 years.</v>

34
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.390
<v Speaker 1>And then in 1991 I was hired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.220
<v Speaker 1>by then late night with David Letterman</v>
<v Speaker 1>at NBC and,</v>

36
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 1>and here we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're 16,</v>

37
00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>

38
00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>and you're staying up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching the tonight show.</v>

39
00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the mid,</v>

40
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>the early and mid seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's George Carlin and Richard Pryor.</v>

42
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.680
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was introduced to Lenny Bruce when</v>

43
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:29.681
<v Speaker 1>I was 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so huge influence on not my standup but</v>

44
00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:36.611
<v Speaker 1>me wanting to become a standup and I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>just one of those guys that I would</v>

45
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:41.060
<v Speaker 1>watch the standups and boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that must be great to do that.</v>

46
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:45.380
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never think that that's what you're</v>

47
00:02:45.381 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 1>gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

48
00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 1>and I ended up doing it for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

49
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.540
<v Speaker 1>for 13 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

50
00:02:50.541 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's this line has,</v>

51
00:02:52.641 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people become standup comics.</v>

52
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same way a woman becomes a hooker.</v>

53
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start,</v>

54
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it,</v>

55
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

56
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of friends and then you realize</v>

57
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you're good enough to get paid.</v>

58
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>When I was a comedian and I was a comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 13 years,</v>

59
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.060
<v Speaker 1>my act was Jews sports and whether that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was pretty active.</v>

60
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Talk about being Jewish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a lot of sports material because I</v>

61
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>was a sports writer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I also had a Gig a later on I was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>illustrated for three years called the</v>

63
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:36.700
<v Speaker 1>show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I love,</v>

64
00:03:36.701 --> 00:03:39.160
<v Speaker 1>which was the perfect marriage of all my</v>
<v Speaker 1>careers.</v>

65
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>It was just topical jokes about sports</v>
<v Speaker 1>every week and um,</v>

66
00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:45.540
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

67
00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.420
<v Speaker 1>and I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to steal David Letterman's</v>

68
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>line about his standup career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was good.</v>

69
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>I was a good standup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was never going to be the guy that</v>

70

<v Speaker 1>you pay $20 to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just not going to because because</v>

<v Speaker 1>unlike my wife who still performs my</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart wasn't in it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I didn't have to be up there.</v>

73
00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I was good enough to be up there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the letterman show,</v>

86
00:04:47.741 --> 00:04:51.250

<v Speaker 1>Rock on the Academy Awards and he hired</v>

101
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>a lot of comics to right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a lot of people I hadn't seen</v>

<v Speaker 1>about your bit about Chinese food.</v>

106
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>And I said to her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to hear it because I have no</v>

107
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:51.970
<v Speaker 1>recollection of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the bit was I used to do a bit</v>

<v Speaker 1>bill at the end of the meals?</v>

112
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:05.060

113
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>and that's the kind of cutting edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff that came out of me.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that it's assumed that I write funny</v>

117
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>stuff every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that,</v>

118
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do it and if you,</v>

119
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>if you write for a strip show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what Letterman is,</v>

120
00:06:31.551 --> 00:06:33.530
<v Speaker 1>which is a show that's on five days a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week,</v>

121
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think about it in terms of if</v>

122
00:06:38.211 --> 00:06:40.970
<v Speaker 1>you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I ever thought about what I had to do</v>

123
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.750
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I could do it.</v>

124
00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It's just with comedy writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially writing on a daily basis.</v>

125
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a muscle that you work and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

126
00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you keep working it,</v>

127
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.960
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Woody Allen once said about joke</v>

128
00:06:59.961 --> 00:07:01.790
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can do it,</v>

129
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:06.930
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I believe that and I'm mostly with</v>

130
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 1>the letterman show.</v>

131
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>I've been a monologue writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

132
00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>I just write jokes for the most part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work on other stuff on the show and</v>

133
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:18.850
<v Speaker 1>it's just when I first started the show</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1991 and they told me I had to write</v>

134
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 1>15 jokes a day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

135
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.310
<v Speaker 1>how am I going to do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I just tried to get through</v>

136
00:07:27.771 --> 00:07:32.771
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then within about six months I was,</v>

137
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't writing 15 jokes a day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was writing 25 or 30 and it got to the</v>

138
00:07:37.761 --> 00:07:42.761
<v Speaker 1>point where I was writing like 50 or 60</v>
<v Speaker 1>jokes a day and you know,</v>

139
00:07:43.041 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>they're not all great and actually very</v>
<v Speaker 1>few of them are great.</v>

140
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:49.910
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing about comedy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to,</v>

141
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you have to write a lot to get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to make mounds and mounds of</v>

142
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:58.661
<v Speaker 1>Cole slaw to get one good serving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what we do on the letterman</v>

143
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just create a lot of content and</v>

144
00:08:01.371 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>ideally the best content gets on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

145
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing about the late show</v>
<v Speaker 1>with David Letterman,</v>

146
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.160
<v Speaker 1>the writers and Dave letter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We write a lot of stuff that's funny.</v>

147
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.930
<v Speaker 1>We read a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good.</v>

148
00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.160
<v Speaker 1>We read a lot of stuff that's lame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but invariably,</v>

149
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.490
<v Speaker 1>invariably night after night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funniest moments in this show are</v>

150
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:35.330
<v Speaker 1>dave reacting in real time to his</v>
<v Speaker 1>surroundings.</v>

151
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:40.070
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that you cannot write</v>
<v Speaker 1>in preparation for the show.</v>

152
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 1>And Dave comes out at the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the night,</v>

153
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.920
<v Speaker 1>the writer's job is to put him in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation where if he needs it,</v>

154
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

155
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.700
<v Speaker 1>the monologue is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he needs it,</v>

156
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 1>the top 10 is there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he needs a couple of good tape pieces</v>

157
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.840
<v Speaker 1>are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he needs it,</v>

158
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and then he can just relax and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>react in the moment.</v>

159
00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:09:03.481 --> 00:09:04.860
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kelly Rogers,</v>

161
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>who I started with who was a great comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people don't know about and Kelly</v>

162
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Rogers said something that was so</v>
<v Speaker 1>profound.</v>

163
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your act is for the nights when you're</v>

164
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.140
<v Speaker 1>not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

165
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

166
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:24.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what the writer's supply to Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they supply him enact for those nights</v>

167
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he doesn't feel funny.</v>

168
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have yet to see a nightlight that</v>

169
00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Larry and I used to talk about this all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time at the beginning of the show</v>

170
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.720
<v Speaker 1>because originally they got picked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>for four episodes and he would say just</v>

171
00:09:43.771 --> 00:09:45.960
<v Speaker 1>enough for the four shows that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing.</v>

172
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>But after that they pick the show up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember what am I supposed to</v>

173
00:09:50.401 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

174
00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:52.843
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry,</v>

175
00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's eight in the morning.</v>

176
00:09:55.020 --> 00:10:00.020
<v Speaker 1>I just woke up please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's one of those things where the</v>

177
00:10:01.291 --> 00:10:05.100
<v Speaker 1>longer you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more things occur to you.</v>

178
00:10:05.101 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>And of course now Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David having worried about that.</v>

179
00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me start that again.</v>

180
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And now Larry David having worried about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at the beginning,</v>

181
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:18.920
<v Speaker 1>he figured out a way throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>years to incorporate his life into his</v>

182
00:10:21.301 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>work and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you know,</v>

183
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 1>how you're out at dinner with friends</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody says something or something</v>

184
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>happens and somebody at the dinner table</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

185
00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:32.130
<v Speaker 1>this is just like an episode of Seinfeld</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

186
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may or may not be true,</v>

187
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:38.841
<v Speaker 1>but when you're with Larry David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never know when a,</v>

188
00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a scene from curb your enthusiasm is</v>

189
00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:44.880
<v Speaker 1>going to burst out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll just give you an example.</v>

190
00:10:44.881 --> 00:10:46.170
<v Speaker 1>A couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:10:46.171 --> 00:10:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Larry and I were having dinner and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

192
00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 1>we got to the end of the meal and I said</v>
<v Speaker 1>to him,</v>

193
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.560
<v Speaker 1>how about some dessert?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to me,</v>

194
00:10:55.561 --> 00:10:58.230
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dessert for me.</v>

195
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Ted Danson and I have a bet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no dessert for a year.</v>

196
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who?</v>

197
00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>It's Larry David,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Ted Danson.</v>

198
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:12.150
<v Speaker 1>They're both billionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bed is no dessert for a year.</v>

199
00:11:12.151 --> 00:11:16.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bed has got to be at least $50,000,</v>

200
00:11:16.321 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe 100,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>

201
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>It's a million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said to him,</v>

202
00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>how much is the bed for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

203
00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.040
<v Speaker 1>$200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

204
00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>have a piece of frigging cake.</v>

205
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:34.340
<v Speaker 1>Let me just say this about Larry David a</v>
<v Speaker 1>try as he might to distance himself from</v>

206
00:11:37.741 --> 00:11:42.741
<v Speaker 1>the character that the world sees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will be unsuccessful at that because</v>

207
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this guy,</v>

208
00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great expression,</v>

209
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 1>a alcoholics are just like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>else except more so.</v>

210
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:58.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry David is just like the guy you see</v>

211
00:11:58.721 --> 00:12:03.721
<v Speaker 1>in curb your enthusiasm except more so</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has,</v>

212
00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

213
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>and I wish this was my line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but somebody once said about famous</v>

214
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:16.380
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

215
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 1>when they get famous they don't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

216
00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:24.100
<v Speaker 1>And Larry David is the exception to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Larry,</v>

217
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.170
<v Speaker 1>as he has gotten better known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is much more comfortable in his skin and</v>

218
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 1>he used to be and much more self aware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll give you an example.</v>

219
00:12:34.091 --> 00:12:35.900
<v Speaker 1>We were at a Yankee game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:39.940
<v Speaker 1>last year and a kid comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

221
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:40.870
<v Speaker 1>18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 years old,</v>

222
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:43.740
<v Speaker 1>comes up with a pen and paper and his</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

223
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:47.490
<v Speaker 1>a Mr David can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I get short of graph?</v>

225
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.310
<v Speaker 1>And he and Larry says to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

226
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.920
<v Speaker 1>come back after the [inaudible] this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no good either in the middle of a game.</v>

227
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.990
<v Speaker 1>And the kid says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

228
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I can always just come back in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

229
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:00.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the inexact I'm watching the game.</v>

230
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:01.990
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the kid says,</v>

231
00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:02.973
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

232
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but you don't understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us know.</v>

233
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.220
<v Speaker 1>And then hearing himself do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he burst out laughing and sign the kid's</v>

234
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 1>paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like I have to tell you,</v>

235
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not happen.</v>

236
00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.870
<v Speaker 1>That does not 15 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

237
00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>this whole scenario winds up in small</v>
<v Speaker 1>claims court.</v>

238
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I've been at the letterman show since</v>
<v Speaker 1>1991 and that's 18 years and I would say</v>

239
00:13:34.301 --> 00:13:39.250
<v Speaker 1>during that time the comedic sensibility</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the show has changed,</v>

240
00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I want to say half a dozen times because</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave has gotten older,</v>

241
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.800
<v Speaker 1>but the average age of the average</v>
<v Speaker 1>writer has stayed the same.</v>

242
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:56.130
<v Speaker 1>So they bring in their sensibilities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think is fun and they try and</v>

243
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 1>interject it into the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the show's comedic sensibility,</v>

244
00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes and it's,</v>

245
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:08.630
<v Speaker 1>it's all valid and we don't write</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything and think,</v>

246
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to write this joke to appeal to</v>

247
00:14:11.261 --> 00:14:15.010
<v Speaker 1>the crucial male,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 to 34 demographic.</v>

248
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:18.850
<v Speaker 1>We don't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least I don't.</v>

249
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I just think what's the funniest take</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

250
00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:24.400
<v Speaker 1>that I can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes,</v>

251
00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:28.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that things have passed me by</v>

252
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.720
<v Speaker 1>just because I'm older and the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching are our younger sometimes I</v>

253
00:14:36.011 --> 00:14:36.844
<v Speaker 1>think that.</v>

254
00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:40.770
<v Speaker 1>But funny is funny is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

255
00:14:40.771 --> 00:14:42.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you show somebody,</v>

256
00:14:42.101 --> 00:14:44.770
<v Speaker 1>a Marx brothers movie who's never seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

257
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that they'll think it's funny</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think that they're going to</v>

258
00:14:48.581 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>ask why isn't groucho naked?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

259
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to see Groucho's deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>late night has really changed in the</v>

260
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:02.683
<v Speaker 1>last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

261
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 1>I think in the last three decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

262
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more variety and there's more</v>

263
00:15:13.281 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

264
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:20.170
<v Speaker 1>before 1982,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was johnny and Johnny Carson and</v>

265
00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:26.921
<v Speaker 1>people that he knocked off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of late night was just,</v>

266
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.230
<v Speaker 1>was carson and it was a monologue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was some sort of body broad comedy</v>

267
00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:40.520
<v Speaker 1>aimed at people over 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>

268
00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:42.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

269
00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:48.010
<v Speaker 1>white people over and white men over</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 30.</v>

270
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.020
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was it.</v>

271
00:15:51.021 --> 00:15:56.021
<v Speaker 1>And then Dave came along in 1982 and NBC</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave Dave Letterman one directive,</v>

272
00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:00.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do,</v>

273
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 1>we want it not to be the tonight show.</v>

274
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:09.520
<v Speaker 1>So we want a three joke monologue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a 25 joke monologue a we want,</v>

275
00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just don't want it to look like the</v>

276
00:16:12.771 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>tonight show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

277
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.610
<v Speaker 1>given that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go ahead,</v>

278
00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:22.210
<v Speaker 1>it was very free flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was irony based,</v>

279
00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was a,</v>

280
00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:28.400
<v Speaker 1>the old producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob Moore used to say a late night with</v>

281
00:16:28.401 --> 00:16:31.190
<v Speaker 1>David Letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It celebrated failure.</v>

282
00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.090
<v Speaker 1>It was not slick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very,</v>

283
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:36.980
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anarchistic.</v>

284
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that was so,</v>

285
00:16:40.831 --> 00:16:43.100
<v Speaker 1>so then that comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then,</v>

286
00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have dave move into cbs 1130 and you</v>

287
00:16:47.961 --> 00:16:51.900
<v Speaker 1>have this situation with Jay where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

288
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.500
<v Speaker 1>you had a one show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

289
00:16:55.790 --> 00:17:00.740
<v Speaker 1>that was a host driven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is Dave and,</v>

290
00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:01.663
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

291
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:05.720
<v Speaker 1>material driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm more,</v>

292
00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:09.050
<v Speaker 1>I would say more concept driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he had another show which is</v>

293
00:17:09.051 --> 00:17:14.051
<v Speaker 1>Jay who was just essentially just a</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic who got his own show and its</v>

294
00:17:15.621 --> 00:17:19.320
<v Speaker 1>monologue and guests and a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

295
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.900
<v Speaker 1>a traditional.</v>

296
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And then you had the 1230 shows with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conan and all of a sudden they were.</v>

297
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>David started this with going after</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger audiences.</v>

298
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always say,</v>

299
00:17:31.731 --> 00:17:34.780
<v Speaker 1>I started watching Dave and college and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.330
<v Speaker 1>so there was a real market out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

301
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.160
<v Speaker 1>like I mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>late night became this very lucrative,</v>

302
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.460
<v Speaker 1>industry for the networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cheap to produce very,</v>

304
00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:53.860
<v Speaker 1>and course once a commercialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once people start making money,</v>

305
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.690
<v Speaker 1>it's going to tend to get watered down</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not gonna be as a,</v>

306
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.790
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be as fearless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

307
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:08.490
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>depend their livelihoods depend on your</v>

308
00:18:08.491 --> 00:18:12.090
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not just kids screwing around</v>

309
00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what happened in,</v>

310
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I would say the late nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

311
00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:22.950
<v Speaker 1>is that the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cable emerge as a late night force</v>

312
00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:28.460
<v Speaker 1>with the daily show and Kobe Bayer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was much more topical,</v>

313
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.870
<v Speaker 1>not that the Letterman show we always</v>
<v Speaker 1>took care of what was in the news and so</v>

314
00:18:33.871 --> 00:18:36.000
<v Speaker 1>did Jay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

315
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.060
<v Speaker 1>it became a more of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

316
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.440
<v Speaker 1>the topical stuff.</v>

317
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:46.620
<v Speaker 1>It became more topical and more issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>oriented.</v>

318
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think we've certainly gone in that</v>

319
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:54.981
<v Speaker 1>direction at the late show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the evolution of that now.</v>

320
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.600
<v Speaker 1>I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was to predict and,</v>

321
00:19:01.601 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always wrong.</v>

322
00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:08.010
<v Speaker 1>So put your money elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to reach a critical</v>

323
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:13.070
<v Speaker 1>mass with the topicality thing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people getting their news because I</v>

324
00:19:14.971 --> 00:19:19.971
<v Speaker 1>think it's going to get a little too</v>
<v Speaker 1>partisan and I think that a late night</v>

325
00:19:22.081 --> 00:19:27.081
<v Speaker 1>shows are going to be put in a situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they shouldn't be put in a,</v>

326
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbeknownst to them,</v>

327
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:36.110
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's probably going to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to a little sillier and,</v>

328
00:19:36.631 --> 00:19:38.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

329
00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:43.020
<v Speaker 1>a little less a celebrity driven and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of easier to take and less fo</v>

331
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:50.310
<v Speaker 1>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at a guy like Craig Ferguson</v>

332
00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:53.280
<v Speaker 1>and watch what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

333
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:57.690
<v Speaker 1>nobody is doing what he's doing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think he'll,</v>

334
00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:01.380
<v Speaker 1>I think he'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will emerge because he is silly.</v>

335
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.410
<v Speaker 1>It's all him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

336
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:05.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

337
00:20:05.911 --> 00:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>the guests don't really have to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

338
00:20:07.921 --> 00:20:10.230
<v Speaker 1>He's going to take care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

339
00:20:10.231 --> 00:20:11.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's where we're going.</v>

340
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that Johnny ever dream</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he would influence a,</v>

341
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:23.990
<v Speaker 1>an election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

342
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

343
00:20:25.021 --> 00:20:27.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he never talked about Watergate when</v>

344
00:20:27.891 --> 00:20:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Watergate was going on and talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it after the fact.</v>

345
00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

346
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

347
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.520
<v Speaker 1>Tina fey had as much to do with the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>election as a,</v>

348
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 1>as Dave did with the situation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>mccain as the daily show,</v>

349
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:44.220
<v Speaker 1>a does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

350
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

351
00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.460
<v Speaker 1>look where is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's where we are,</v>

352
00:20:48.461 --> 00:20:50.230
<v Speaker 1>where these shows and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

353
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:50.950
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

354
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:54.070
<v Speaker 1>and none of these shows set out to</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence elections,</v>

355
00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:56.130
<v Speaker 1>but that's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>

356
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.300
<v Speaker 1>right in the popular culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

357
00:20:58.301 --> 00:21:01.770
<v Speaker 1>I never bought all those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

358
00:21:01.771 --> 00:21:05.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>studies and surveys about people getting</v>

359
00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:09.790
<v Speaker 1>their news from late night television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I and I still don't,</v>

360
00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 1>but I think that people turn to late</v>
<v Speaker 1>night television,</v>

361
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:18.340
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what the point of view is on the</v>

362
00:21:18.341 --> 00:21:20.800
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they know going in,</v>

363
00:21:20.801 --> 00:21:22.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we're in the education</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

364
00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Here's the deal with society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Fall in love with the idea of</v>

365
00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 1>things rather than the reality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

366
00:21:30.250 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 1>And that holds true for late night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

367
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:38.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so much a more provocative and</v>

368
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:43.470
<v Speaker 1>sexier to say that people are watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>our show and getting their news from</v>

369
00:21:44.921 --> 00:21:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Dave letterman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let me tell you,</v>

370
00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:51.040
<v Speaker 1>as somebody that writes monologue jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody that knows Dave,</v>

371
00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I tell them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

372
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.860
<v Speaker 1>we find that very funny.</v>

373
00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Here's the difference between a writing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monologue jokes in writing a fiction,</v>

374
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:05.501
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

375
00:22:05.501 --> 00:22:09.730
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use the word intern much less and</v>

376
00:22:09.731 --> 00:22:11.560
<v Speaker 1>waterboarding much less when you write</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

377
00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.593
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

378
00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

379
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.600
<v Speaker 1>it's a different muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A writing a monologue jokes or writing</v>

380
00:22:19.031 --> 00:22:22.630
<v Speaker 1>jokes for a nightly show is a volume</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

381
00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:28.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a volume business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're just turning out a quantity and</v>

382
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:32.110
<v Speaker 1>then panning for gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

383
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.050
<v Speaker 1>you're using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

384
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.810
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the words of the steroid universe,</v>

385
00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you're using your quick twitch muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

386
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you're just firing more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're firing quicker and you're just</v>

387
00:22:47.831 --> 00:22:49.720
<v Speaker 1>reacting quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's all about,</v>

388
00:22:49.721 --> 00:22:53.560
<v Speaker 1>takes different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many different takes to a premise.</v>

389
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's writing comedy for television.</v>

390
00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing a fiction,</v>

391
00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:05.910
<v Speaker 1>writing humorous fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything slows down and it's a</v>

392
00:23:06.011 --> 00:23:08.890
<v Speaker 1>different muscle and it's a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

393
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.380
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

394
00:23:11.381 --> 00:23:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I think writing jokes is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a real physical practice.</v>

395
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:21.280
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's all free association and,</v>

396
00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.460
<v Speaker 1>and writing fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

397
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:28.480
<v Speaker 1>it's inhabiting a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's getting into a state of mind where</v>

398
00:23:28.481 --> 00:23:32.470
<v Speaker 1>you're a for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're inhabiting this world of</v>

399
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:37.120
<v Speaker 1>these characters you created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for me,</v>

400
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 1>writing fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

401
00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I want to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my premises to be funny.</v>

402
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:47.150
<v Speaker 1>I want my situations to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want my characters to be complicated,</v>

403
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.660
<v Speaker 1>but it must be plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be even however chaotic.</v>

404
00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It must be plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about a lot of great</v>

405
00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:00.980
<v Speaker 1>monologue jokes is that they are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>plausible.</v>

406
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.550
<v Speaker 1>There's sort of a little really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

407
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:08.090
<v Speaker 1>it's like when we talked about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people ask me,</v>

408
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:09.980
<v Speaker 1>how'd you learn to write fiction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

409
00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I learned to write fiction writing for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dave because,</v>

410
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:13.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

411
00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:18.911
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden we'd have some jokes</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Hillary Clinton and Dave would</v>

412
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.980
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just start it with,</v>

413
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:23.960
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you heard Hillary Clinton's going</v>

414
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:24.920
<v Speaker 1>to jail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

415
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.500
<v Speaker 1>she's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She never was,</v>

416
00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:32.680
<v Speaker 1>but he loved that it was a grabber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could get a laugh and then he would,</v>

417
00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:34.940
<v Speaker 1>he could come down off it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the joke.</v>

418
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might find its way in somebody</v>

419
00:24:39.741 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 1>else's novel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's never going to find its way in</v>

420
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:44.360
<v Speaker 1>a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you an example.</v>

421
00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:50.630
<v Speaker 1>When Hillary was elected to the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

422
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:53.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then bill was out of office.</v>

423
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.720
<v Speaker 1>There was a story in the times that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a little lonely in Chappaqua.</v>

424
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.760
<v Speaker 1>He was sort of rattling around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

425
00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:07.030
<v Speaker 1>so he would go down once a week and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast at a coffee shop in Chappaqua.</v>

426
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of quaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of charming.</v>

427
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

428
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.100
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't good enough for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was,</v>

429
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.860
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't good comedically.</v>

430
00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.840
<v Speaker 1>So we did jokes for two weeks about him</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging out at a singles bar in</v>

431
00:25:23.841 --> 00:25:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Chappaqua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just made up all these and it was</v>

432
00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:30.740
<v Speaker 1>great and we had a ball with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

433
00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 1>and it is it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

434
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.960
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm sort of arguing against</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself because it is a little plausible.</v>

435
00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.280
<v Speaker 1>The Clinton might go to a singles bar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we just made it up and um,</v>

436
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.960
<v Speaker 1>and people knew we had made it up and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

437
00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:47.690
<v Speaker 1>it was very valid as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

438
00:25:47.691 --> 00:25:51.920
<v Speaker 1>as comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the deal of the best advice I</v>

439
00:25:51.921 --> 00:25:55.320
<v Speaker 1>ever got about writing fiction was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

440
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.810
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you know,</v>

441
00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:00.870
<v Speaker 1>and make your character's lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated because,</v>

442
00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:02.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all have a story in us and it's,</v>

443
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:06.500
<v Speaker 1>it's our autobiography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know we think it's fascinating.</v>

444
00:26:06.501 --> 00:26:09.920
<v Speaker 1>God knows I do and it may very well be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating,</v>

445
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.570
<v Speaker 1>but it aint complicated.</v>

446
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:18.380
<v Speaker 1>This is my third novel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything hurts and,</v>

447
00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:19.740
<v Speaker 1>and it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

448
00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.710
<v Speaker 1>it is born of a real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a book about a guy trying to get</v>

449
00:26:24.711 --> 00:26:29.711
<v Speaker 1>rid of a psychosomatic limp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he seeks the aid of a legitimate</v>

450
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:36.950
<v Speaker 1>self help guru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an accidental self help guru and to</v>

451
00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.930
<v Speaker 1>cure him of his psychosomatic limp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seeks the aid of a legitimate self</v>

452
00:26:41.931 --> 00:26:46.931
<v Speaker 1>help guru and is borne of real life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because for three and a half years I</v>

453
00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.810
<v Speaker 1>dragged a foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I limped,</v>

454
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:53.930
<v Speaker 1>I was in constant pain and it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It confounded doctorsx,</v>

455
00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:57.510
<v Speaker 1>rays and Mris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned up nothing.</v>

456
00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:02.511
<v Speaker 1>The pain moved around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no consistent symptomatology.</v>

457
00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It came and went of its own accord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It made no sense to anybody,</v>

458
00:27:07.141 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 1>but I was in constant pain and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>sought the help of a guy who specialized</v>

459
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.430
<v Speaker 1>in a psychosomatic pain.</v>

460
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.880
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believes that the pain is caused by</v>

461
00:27:19.981 --> 00:27:24.930
<v Speaker 1>unconscious rage driving to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious mind and your conscious mind</v>

462
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:29.931
<v Speaker 1>is so threatened by the coming rage that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tries to distract you by giving you</v>

463
00:27:31.261 --> 00:27:34.740
<v Speaker 1>pain to a vulnerable area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his theory.</v>

464
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>I still believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

465
00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.830
<v Speaker 1>And so his approach is to examine your</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

466
00:27:40.831 --> 00:27:42.930
<v Speaker 1>So I'd been seeing him for a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>while and I said,</v>

467
00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:46.620
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to write a novel about a guy</v>

468
00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:51.270
<v Speaker 1>trying to get rid of a psychosomatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>limp and try to get myself out of this</v>

469
00:27:51.271 --> 00:27:53.260
<v Speaker 1>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started writing it.</v>

470
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It took me two years to finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two years later,</v>

471
00:27:55.951 --> 00:27:59.670
<v Speaker 1>I'm finished with the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son of a bitch guy in the book is fine.</v>

472
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm still dragging a foot and in</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant pain.</v>

473
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 1>So I sold the book to Simon and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schuster.</v>

474
00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.880
<v Speaker 1>Ten days after I sold the book I went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet another doctor took another look at</v>

475
00:28:10.951 --> 00:28:13.980
<v Speaker 1>another x ray and said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a hip replacement.</v>

476
00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you you should get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

477
00:28:16.891 --> 00:28:19.410
<v Speaker 1>you have to get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a no brainer.</v>

478
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.730
<v Speaker 1>And so a year ago in July,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last July,</v>

479
00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.220
<v Speaker 1>I got my hip replaced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm out of pain.</v>

480
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And everybody who,</v>

481
00:28:30.180 --> 00:28:32.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered along with me said,</v>

482
00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:36.300
<v Speaker 1>you must be furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three and a half years limping and</v>

483
00:28:36.301 --> 00:28:38.100
<v Speaker 1>constant pain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I say the same thing,</v>

484
00:28:38.101 --> 00:28:39.990
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I hadn't done that,</v>

485
00:28:40.110 --> 00:28:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't have gotten the book out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

486
00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

487
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:45.030
<v Speaker 1>the journey is the destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

488
00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:51.850
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

489
00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:55.050
<v Speaker 1>because as I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned,</v>

490
00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:00.120
<v Speaker 1>I was in constant pain and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>few times that I was not in pain was</v>

491
00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:02.730
<v Speaker 1>when I was writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean writing at the letterman show</v>

492
00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.640
<v Speaker 1>or working on the fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day here,</v>

493
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:08.580
<v Speaker 1>the day would be over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd come home and relax,</v>

494
00:29:08.581 --> 00:29:10.980
<v Speaker 1>put my feet up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible pain,</v>

495
00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and they could not be relieved by any</v>
<v Speaker 1>pill or anything like that,</v>

496
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:19.701
<v Speaker 1>which made me sure it was a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so this book is a reflection of</v>

497
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:23.400
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

498
00:29:23.401 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

499
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:26.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

500
00:29:26.221 --> 00:29:27.930
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure people have said this</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

501
00:29:27.931 --> 00:29:28.860
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

502
00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:33.920
<v Speaker 1>artists create because they have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because they need to and not because</v>

503
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.800
<v Speaker 1>they think they should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because they have to.</v>

504
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a classic case of it.</v>

505
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:48.781
<v Speaker 1>So it was very fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very ambitious because I was</v>

506
00:29:49.091 --> 00:29:54.091
<v Speaker 1>suffering while I was writing it and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy is getting better and it's like,</v>

507
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 1>and I was aspiring to the character I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was writing about,</v>

508
00:29:58.661 --> 00:30:02.620
<v Speaker 1>which is a boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to recreate that in my next</v>

509
00:30:02.621 --> 00:30:03.850
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be great?</v>
