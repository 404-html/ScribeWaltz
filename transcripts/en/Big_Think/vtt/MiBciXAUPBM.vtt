1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.540
<v Speaker 2>personally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today I'm in a very interesting</v>

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.480
<v Speaker 2>stereophonic Ka Ka Ka conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.050
<v Speaker 2>in one ear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.620
<v Speaker 2>I hear beautiful symphonic music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 2>it comes from a person like a Gordon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown in the UK.</v>

8
00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 2>It comes from a person like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 2>the crown prince of Abu Dhabi who says I</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to build in Abu Dhabi where were,</v>

10
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.570
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were today.</v>

11
00:00:39.571 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 2>This the beginnings of an idea capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a full idea capital.</v>

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 2>I talked to lead leaders like a Gordon</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brown and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed.</v>

13
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 2>And I hear from them first of all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they embraced the notion that the world</v>

14
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 2>of the 21st century is going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>world of,</v>

15
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 2>of ideas that that education and</v>
<v Speaker 2>education has the highest level.</v>

16
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be the key to unlocking</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and,</v>

17
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.560
<v Speaker 2>and that they see as the future of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>societies investing heavily on the</v>

18
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.360
<v Speaker 2>public sphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>investing heavily in,</v>

19
00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.010
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in higher education and access to higher</v>

20
00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>education for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for every talented student and,</v>

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.270
<v Speaker 2>and for system that builds to plus the</v>
<v Speaker 2>students as far up the talent,</v>

22
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 2>talent pyramid as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

23
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:30.330
<v Speaker 2>as they can be pressed.</v>

24
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand here in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>

25
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I hear very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few of our political leaders</v>

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.070
<v Speaker 2>grasping that concept and dedicating</v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves to it.</v>

27
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 2>You hear a person like Mike Bloomberg in</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York who,</v>

28
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:48.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sees the fact that,</v>

29
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that maintaining New York as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as one of the few idea capitals of the</v>

30
00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 2>world is key to the city's future and</v>
<v Speaker 2>building the infrastructure</v>

31
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 2>educationally from kindergarten right</v>
<v Speaker 2>through the leading research</v>

32
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:05.991
<v Speaker 2>universities we have in the city is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pivotal to New York maintaining it's</v>

33
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 2>positioned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

34
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:11.700
<v Speaker 2>but what you begin to see dangerously</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

35
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 2>is most of our political leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually on the other side of the</v>

36
00:02:17.851 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the other ear,</v>

37
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:22.150
<v Speaker 2>in the stereophonic world in which I</v>
<v Speaker 2>live in,</v>

38
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 2>in the other ear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hear kind of grading a total music</v>

39
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 2>coming from the political leadership,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

40
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.840
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States where,</v>

41
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.320
<v Speaker 2>where they've begun to demagogue around</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues of higher education.</v>

42
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 2>So you hear a constant connection of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

43
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.503
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

44
00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.150
<v Speaker 2>healthcare costs and the cost of higher</v>
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>

45
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 2>A very simplistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>appealing and the talking point message,</v>

46
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 2>especially to the middle class for whom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the higher education costs are all seem</v>

48
00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 2>to be skyrocketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

49
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

50
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to run past the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

51
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

52
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.131
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at,</v>

53
00:03:05.131 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 2>at most of the great universities of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country where tuition,</v>

54
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going up,</v>

55
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

56
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.010
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

57
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going up because of the pressure of</v>

58
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.260
<v Speaker 2>providing the kind of quality education</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to provide the,</v>

59
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.380
<v Speaker 2>it's going up because the cost of books</v>
<v Speaker 2>and technology are going up.</v>

60
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>It's going up because knowledge is</v>
<v Speaker 2>expanding and it's more to cover and</v>

61
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 2>therefore you have to hire more faculty</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>

62
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 2>And it's going up because every single</v>
<v Speaker 2>reform you want to make to provide a</v>

63
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:37.150
<v Speaker 2>better education as students to come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you involves lowering the student</v>

64
00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 2>faculty ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means increasing your personnel</v>

65
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 2>costs.</v>

66
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.060
<v Speaker 2>And universities are essentially when</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

67
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 2>when you boil everything down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially irreducibly,</v>

68
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 2>they are socrates and the tree and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>student.</v>

69
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

70
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.540
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the problem of the live string</v>

71
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:57.390
<v Speaker 2>quartet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

72
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.450
<v Speaker 2>how the personnel intensive a system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a university is.</v>

73
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:06.180
<v Speaker 2>It's personal intensive faculty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Students are,</v>

74
00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a live string quartet,</v>

75
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't use technology,</v>

76
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't take the music because then</v>

77
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 2>it's not live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't cut your personnel costs.</v>

78
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 2>That is not a quartet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

79
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 2>you can't play the music faster because</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it's not really the music.</v>

80
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 2>And that's what we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is engaged in,</v>

81
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.180
<v Speaker 2>in a high class education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

82
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

83
00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.430
<v Speaker 2>the politicians in the United States as</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

84
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they appealed glibly to the,</v>

85
00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cost of higher education,</v>

86
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:44.320
<v Speaker 2>I began to pound that which makes this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country very special.</v>

87
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean higher education is the pride of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

88
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.650
<v Speaker 2>If they act as if there's some kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly out there among the 6,500</v>

89
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.860
<v Speaker 2>actors in higher education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>diversity as we are,</v>

90
00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 2>that is involved in a conspiracy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>build the middleclass of their money.</v>

91
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could not be more wrong and it</v>

92
00:05:10.001 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>could not be more shortsighted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here I am in the stereophonic</v>

93
00:05:13.631 --> 00:05:18.631
<v Speaker 2>conversation where outside the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States people are getting the idea that</v>

94
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:19.560
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

95
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.780
<v Speaker 2>what you need to have the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

96
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the future to own the future,</v>

97
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.170
<v Speaker 2>to be one of the idea capitals in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>matrix world of idea capitals.</v>

98
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.850
<v Speaker 2>You need great higher education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And here in the United States we're in</v>

99
00:05:33.851 --> 00:05:35.150
<v Speaker 2>the process of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

100
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:35.830
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

101
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:39.640
<v Speaker 2>of a devaluing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're in the process of,</v>

102
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 2>in a world where we dominate today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess this isn't a good metaphor</v>

103
00:05:46.961 --> 00:05:49.060
<v Speaker 2>to use given the present state of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yankees,</v>

104
00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 2>but I'll use it anyway speaking more to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glory of the franchise.</v>

105
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Over time we're in the process of</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning the Yankees into the mud hens.</v>

106
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 2>Well now the rest of the world is saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

107
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

108
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to create what you have and</v>

109
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 2>if you look 25 and 50 years after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very dangerous world for the</v>

110
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you change that?</v>

111
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>You change it by issuing the clarion</v>
<v Speaker 2>call,</v>

112
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

113
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the political leadership to begin to</v>

114
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 2>take the long view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though,</v>

115
00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>even though it may not be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>politically effect,</v>

116
00:06:22.101 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 2>the view.</v>
