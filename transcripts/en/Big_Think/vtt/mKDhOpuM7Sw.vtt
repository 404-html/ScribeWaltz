1
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:13.030
<v Speaker 1>I think our women's program got started</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot sooner and with a lot more</v>

2
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>seriousness than the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think most,</v>

3
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>most of the rest of the world doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect women's soccer.</v>

4
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 1>Whereas here we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

5
00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's awesome.</v>

6
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>And so we're gonna put the money and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resources into it to make them the best</v>

7
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>team that they can be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think we got a good jump on the</v>

8
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world in that fashion</v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world was like women's</v>

10
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's ever.</v>

12
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>It's all about men's soccer everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's all everybody cares about.</v>

13
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>So even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they have women's national</v>

14
00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>teams in place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still not that respect that we</v>

15
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:48.590
<v Speaker 1>give our women's national team here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.380
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>disappointing on a lot of levels for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>

18
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But for here we give our women's</v>
<v Speaker 1>national team the same kind of coverage</v>

19
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:57.750
<v Speaker 1>would give them meds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We give them the same respect.</v>

20
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm they have some great players and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's cleared out the countries that have</v>

21
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.540
<v Speaker 1>started taking it a little more serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the women's game are starting to be</v>

22
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.820
<v Speaker 1>at our women's team and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:01:08.821 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>there's seems to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:13.860
<v Speaker 1>like five or six top teams that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US included that are,</v>

25
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>kind of just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

27
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>is being switched back and forth now and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't,</v>

28
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>us doesn't dominate as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now there's some trepidation in the US</v>

29
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>soccer camp that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>we might have lost our foothold and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women's soccer a spectrum.</v>

31
00:01:28.051 --> 00:01:29.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

32
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Only good for our program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad to have some fear because they</v>

33
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:34.530
<v Speaker 1>were running the show for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a number of years.</v>

34
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

35
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a touch about the competition</v>

36
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think once the other teams will say,</v>

37
00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's got a very good women's</v>

38
00:01:50.691 --> 00:01:53.060
<v Speaker 1>national team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once they kind of decided,</v>

39
00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:53.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

40
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:56.480
<v Speaker 1>we want our German team to win.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't want USA to win everything.</v>

41
00:01:56.481 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Then they started being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the competition comes in and the</v>

42
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.840
<v Speaker 1>pride comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now they've got a great women's</v>

43
00:02:02.841 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 1>national team and it competes with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>team in Brazil as well.</v>

44
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just another country that it does some</v>

45
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:10.070
<v Speaker 1>of the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that would,</v>

47
00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that would generate more respect for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>women's game.</v>

48
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.120
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see why it wouldn't,</v>

49
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

50
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.930
<v Speaker 1>that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could just be a pride thing and I</v>

51
00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>don't want to lose the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean ultimately it's a good thing</v>

52
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.100
<v Speaker 1>all the way around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just means more exposure for the women's</v>

53
00:02:25.101 --> 00:02:25.934
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54
00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>I have a 10 month old daughter at home</v>
<v Speaker 1>named Julia.</v>

55
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

56
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a much different appreciation for</v>

57
00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>women's sports and I probably would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise because,</v>

58
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want her to at least have that as an</v>

59
00:02:38.781 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 1>option if that's something she wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
