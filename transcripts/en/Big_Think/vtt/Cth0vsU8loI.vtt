1
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Software unification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>so that I no longer care what computing</v>
<v Speaker 1>device I pick up,</v>

3
00:00:22.241 --> 00:00:25.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a laptop or a desktop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's one I own are one in a</v>

4
00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>public place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>whether it has a small screen or a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>screen.</v>

6
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sit down,</v>

7
00:00:32.051 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>identify myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tune in my information world.</v>

8
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it in the same way on a no screen</v>

9
00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>computer in a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>uniform access across all platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>

11
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>telephones to my entire information</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

12
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to achieve in hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're hard software issues,</v>

13
00:00:57.431 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>but they should have been solved 15</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

14
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>So long from the other side of the fence</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

15
00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I were to invest in a,</v>

16
00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>in a new company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would invest in some of the companies</v>

17
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>that are working on so called digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>furnaces.</v>

18
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in five years everybody throws out all</v>

19
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>his cds and dvds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are larger MP3 players.</v>

20
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>A home stereo system is and t v V</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems are integrated and this is a</v>

21
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.210
<v Speaker 1>billion multibillion dollar transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As things stand,</v>

22
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>it will be Sony and Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Toshiba,</v>

23
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>a few with very large companies doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

24
00:01:38.311 --> 00:01:40.170
<v Speaker 1>And they won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't do it badly,</v>

25
00:01:40.171 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>but they won't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

26
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would invest in,</v>

27
00:01:42.991 --> 00:01:47.991
<v Speaker 1>in one of the small companies that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>imaginative instead of recycled ideas as</v>

28
00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>to how to make that transition.</v>

29
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.111
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

30
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:54.581
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

31
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one of the spaces I'm really</v>

32
00:01:56.211 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 2>watching very carefully is the mobile</v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

33
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.370
<v Speaker 2>And I think that for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>innovation on the mobile platform was</v>

34
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 2>held back by the carriers and their</v>
<v Speaker 2>control over everything and they're sort</v>

35
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 2>of passion to control everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

36
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 2>now that we're getting some brands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>phones that are consumer brands that are</v>

37
00:02:20.451 --> 00:02:25.451
<v Speaker 2>popular enough that we're starting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the correct kind of a separation of,</v>

38
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.270
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want an iphone or I want to,</v>

40
00:02:29.271 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I Google phone an android phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

41
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 2>People start to say those kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

42
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those are the,</v>

43
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>those are the brands they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the carrier is just whoever you give</v>

44
00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 2>service from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if we can break that,</v>

45
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.720
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that control that the carriers have had</v>

46
00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 2>over the platform,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we get the same kind of innovation</v>

47
00:02:47.391 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 2>that we had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

48
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.280
<v Speaker 2>on computers and the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People can be building apps and doing</v>

49
00:02:52.281 --> 00:02:54.920
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of crazy things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what's gonna come out</v>

50
00:02:54.921 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 2>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

51
00:02:55.791 --> 00:02:59.150
<v Speaker 2>I just know that when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you put together a platform,</v>

52
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>people can innovate on interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>things end up happening.</v>

53
00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

54
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

55
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

56
00:03:11.451 --> 00:03:13.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm obviously looking forward to what's</v>

57
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 2>going to happen in media and the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people consume a content.</v>

58
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.230
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm most interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

59
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:24.050
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly the whole idea of mobile in the</v>

60
00:03:24.051 --> 00:03:26.060
<v Speaker 2>idea that you are carrying around with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

61
00:03:26.061 --> 00:03:30.320
<v Speaker 2>a screen that can go with you and know</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you are and know who your friends</v>

62
00:03:30.321 --> 00:03:31.220
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

63
00:03:31.221 --> 00:03:36.221
<v Speaker 2>utilizing that kind of a technology to</v>
<v Speaker 2>immerse yourself into the world of a</v>

64
00:03:37.041 --> 00:03:39.440
<v Speaker 2>narrative is something that I'm most</v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>

65
00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:42.200
<v Speaker 2>How to create narrative that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

66
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>that helps people understand what their</v>
<v Speaker 2>places in the world and how to make the</v>

67
00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:50.510
<v Speaker 2>world a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So those kinds of technologies are most</v>

68
00:03:50.511 --> 00:03:55.511
<v Speaker 2>interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

69
00:03:55.621 --> 00:03:57.570
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now I'm interested,</v>

70
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm interested in as a storyteller in</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 2>in trying to use narrative to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to promote good in the world.</v>

72
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:06.630
<v Speaker 2>So I'm interested in companies that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

73
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 2>that are philanthropic by nature and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to um,</v>

74
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to promote,</v>

75
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:13.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the greater good.</v>

76
00:04:13.561 --> 00:04:14.550
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

77
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.970
<v Speaker 2>technology that's designed to make the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world a better place.</v>

78
00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

79
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.060
<v Speaker 2>it's the most interesting to me.</v>

80
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.700
<v Speaker 3>I think what I've heard is a lot more</v>
<v Speaker 3>disruption going on and that's exciting</v>

81
00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:31.020
<v Speaker 3>because it means there are new</v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities.</v>

82
00:04:31.021 --> 00:04:34.380
<v Speaker 3>It's frightening too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I find optimism and excitement in</v>

83
00:04:34.381 --> 00:04:39.381
<v Speaker 3>disruption</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of on a,</v>

84
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.850
<v Speaker 3>but I think that the answer might be</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the streamed web is important.</v>

85
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.250
<v Speaker 3>We thought the web was about content</v>
<v Speaker 3>like ours sites and pages,</v>

86
00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.970
<v Speaker 3>but I think now we see with twitter and</v>
<v Speaker 3>rss and email all adding up,</v>

87
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 3>it says new streamed live web and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be hard to get used to that</v>

88
00:04:55.841 --> 00:04:58.210
<v Speaker 3>next never ending web of content.</v>

89
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to have great new</v>

90
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.060
<v Speaker 2>ways to interface with information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

91
00:05:08.061 --> 00:05:11.300
<v Speaker 2>that's on normal desktop and laptop</v>
<v Speaker 2>computers,</v>

92
00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:14.450
<v Speaker 2>but also mobile devices.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think we'll see much more</v>

93
00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:17.210
<v Speaker 2>interactivity in the way we interface</v>
<v Speaker 2>with things.</v>

94
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 2>And we'll see much more richness in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication between the computer and</v>

95
00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 2>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Gosh.</v>

96
00:05:26.671 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a specific company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know some directions I would,</v>

97
00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I would bet on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet on,</v>

98
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interactivity moving forward a great</v>

99
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:38.490
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet on applications replacing or</v>

100
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 2>supplementing documents for describing</v>
<v Speaker 2>things for content.</v>

101
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.980
<v Speaker 2>So I think we'll see media outlets</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce very active content in the</v>

102
00:05:46.981 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 2>future that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that readers can kind of interact with.</v>

103
00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>So those are some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the directions that I think will</v>

104
00:05:52.621 --> 00:05:53.250
<v Speaker 2>be exciting.</v>
