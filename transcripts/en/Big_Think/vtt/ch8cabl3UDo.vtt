1
00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I think that the people who have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing political satire or the people</v>

2
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to have really felt like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be the,</v>

3
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.150
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media was the watchdog for um,</v>

4
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5
00:00:26.471 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 1>the government and corporate America and</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the media sort of felt like it was</v>

6
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:34.330
<v Speaker 1>in bed and they were lazy or in bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

7
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 1>with their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>advertisers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.180
<v Speaker 1>I think comics naturally started filling</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of sort of being the watchdog</v>

10
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>of the watchdog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.780
<v Speaker 1>pill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political satire and comedy.</v>

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.350
<v Speaker 1>We just started asking the questions</v>
<v Speaker 1>that journalists weren't asking anymore,</v>

13
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through humor,</v>

14
00:00:51.761 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>through sort of hopefully funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>righteous sanger,</v>

15
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also just asking questions that our</v>

16
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>audience wanted to hear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so we were doing basically a service</v>

17
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>we just kept doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were doing,</v>

18
00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.320
<v Speaker 1>but then it just transitioned into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out what's going on or if we're</v>

19
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:15.490
<v Speaker 1>just going to be lied to from right left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and center to provide a haven where at</v>

20
00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:19.450
<v Speaker 1>least people can come together and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel crazy.</v>

21
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:20.111
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

22
00:01:20.111 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm in a group of people who have</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that everybody's spinning us</v>

23
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.250
<v Speaker 1>and somebody onstage pointing that out</v>
<v Speaker 1>through humor.</v>

24
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.610
<v Speaker 1>At least I can breathe a sigh that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>not insane.</v>

25
00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:35.611
<v Speaker 1>When I hear the cacophony of lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think comedy can be a tool for social</v>

26
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>activism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that when you point out</v>

27
00:01:42.261 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>hypocrisy again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the media often doesn't,</v>

28
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

29
00:01:46.281 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the followup question should just be put</v>

30
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:52.550
<v Speaker 1>in the Smithsonian as a relic of media</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are no follow ups anymore.</v>

31
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 1>People don't have enough historical</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge to say,</v>

32
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're lying if you don't have enough</v>

33
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>knowledge on the environment to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists say there's global warming,</v>

35
00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>it's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of information just sort of</v>

36
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>floats out there like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thick muggy day and nobody weeds</v>

37
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:14.600
<v Speaker 1>through it and cuts through the muck and</v>
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

38
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.500
<v Speaker 1>here's the truth.</v>

39
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 1>And I think that pointing that out</v>
<v Speaker 1>through humor can be a tool to have</v>

40
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

41
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should be asking questions and I'm</v>

42
00:02:25.281 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

43
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.800
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's what's fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you can ask questions yourself</v>

44
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 1>on stage through humor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then that means the audience kind of</v>

45
00:02:33.711 --> 00:02:36.230
<v Speaker 1>scratches a tent and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

46
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>And as you watch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>videos on the web and the daily show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colbert,</v>

48
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>Bill Maher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see them lay out a case and</v>

49
00:02:44.211 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>make it funny through video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through things that are out there.</v>

50
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>Somebody says one thing one day and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else the next day.</v>

51
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

52
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this amazing medium with which</v>

53
00:02:53.601 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>we can put it out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
