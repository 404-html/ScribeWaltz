00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Senator Wilford has to be one of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest heroes.</v>

2
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm Sargent Shriver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Senator Welford were the driving</v>

3
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>force behind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.370
<v Speaker 1>and institution and more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a grand idea,</v>

5
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.460
<v Speaker 1>the Peace Corps that inspired me in so</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of my generation to understand that</v>

6
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:39.871
<v Speaker 1>we could make meaningful contributions</v>
<v Speaker 1>through public service and that those</v>

7
00:00:39.881 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>contributions could have an impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger world.</v>

8
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.970
<v Speaker 1>I grew up as an Arab American already</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling connected to a larger world,</v>

9
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.660
<v Speaker 1>the Peace Corps and so much of what has</v>
<v Speaker 1>grown out of it,</v>

10
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave me the ability,</v>

11
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it really motivated me and inspired me</v>
<v Speaker 1>in everything that I have sought to</v>

12
00:01:01.241 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>achieve in my life since.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

13
00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:09.241
<v Speaker 1>as I have said on a number of occasions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideals and the values and the,</v>

14
00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

15
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.960
<v Speaker 1>the mission of the Peace Corps and of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit behind it really is what</v>

16
00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:23.011
<v Speaker 1>first drew King Hussein and myself</v>
<v Speaker 1>together as we found common ground,</v>

17
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 1>having grown up in completely different</v>
<v Speaker 1>worlds.</v>

18
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:31.381
<v Speaker 1>We found common ground through this</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of public service and joined our</v>

19
00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 1>lives together to carry on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel that I am a Peace Corps volunteer</v>

20
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.470
<v Speaker 1>to this day and will continue to be and</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider every peace corps volunteer a</v>

21
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 1>sister and a brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>um.</v>
