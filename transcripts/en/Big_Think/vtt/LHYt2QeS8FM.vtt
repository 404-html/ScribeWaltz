1
00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.960
<v Speaker 1>There are myths of creativity and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>myths are usually propagated by people</v>

2
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:17.321
<v Speaker 1>that have romantic notions about heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>romantic notions about Eureka moments.</v>

3
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>And these myths of creativity keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from collaborating and it causes</v>

4
00:00:23.061 --> 00:00:27.650
<v Speaker 1>them to be a lone wolf and the research</v>
<v Speaker 1>says it causes them to fail.</v>

5
00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>So let me talk a little bit about those</v>
<v Speaker 1>myths of creativity.</v>

6
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.130
<v Speaker 1>In the world of sales and marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I battle against three myths.</v>

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Myth number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lone inventor.</v>

8
00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>This is very dangerous because there is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no such thing as alone in venture.</v>

9
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of historical research</v>

10
00:00:46.161 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 1>that has debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Einstein,</v>

11
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically in terms of inventions.</v>

12
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a lone inventor.</v>

13
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classic example,</v>

14
00:00:55.701 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Edison in the invention</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

15
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Thomas Edison is a brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stands for 14 people.</v>

16
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a figure head named Thomas</v>

17
00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Edison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name's on 10,000 patents.</v>

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>He did not invent a single thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He marshaled people together and knew</v>

19
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:12.560
<v Speaker 1>how to spot innovations and put people</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

20
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Lack of a creative soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

21
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>Here's a classic example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Steve Jobs.</v>

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ask the average person,</v>

23
00:01:19.131 --> 00:01:21.680
<v Speaker 1>say a millennial who uses a lot of apple</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

24
00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>who's one of the greatest inventors of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our time?</v>

25
00:01:23.511 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>They'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve Jobs.</v>

26
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 1>Steve jobs once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never created anything.</v>

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>All I did was notice patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It put people together to finish</v>

28
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 1>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so think about it.</v>

29
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.370
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't have Wazniak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no original apple,</v>

30
00:01:37.371 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't have eyes,</v>

31
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>there is no ipod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he doesn't have Tony Fidel,</v>

32
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>there is no iphone and the list goes on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on.</v>

33
00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.400
<v Speaker 1>Got a good friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Berkus.</v>

34
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.350
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a really wonderful book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the about about the myths of,</v>

35
00:01:51.351 --> 00:01:56.351
<v Speaker 1>of genius and he was telling me that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a romantic notion and I remember</v>

36
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>when I first read this research years</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

37
00:02:00.021 --> 00:02:02.810
<v Speaker 1>no lone inventor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it did kind of hurt my feelings.</v>

38
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>I'm the musician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my past I thought I wrote a lot of</v>

39
00:02:06.111 --> 00:02:07.970
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but according to the research,</v>

40
00:02:07.971 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I didn't never wrote a song.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always collaborated with somebody.</v>

41
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>The song that actually made it to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>record and made it on the radio,</v>

42
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.660
<v Speaker 1>had 15 to 50 hands on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to David,</v>

43
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I read your research kind of hurt</v>

44
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:20.481
<v Speaker 1>my feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

45
00:02:20.481 --> 00:02:23.150
<v Speaker 1>it's a romantic notion because we want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be heroes.</v>

46
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 1>We want to be as empowered as I then</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran.</v>

47
00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 1>We want to think that we're the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fountainhead.</v>

48
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.510
<v Speaker 1>So this is how we tell the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But until you believe that genius is a</v>

49
00:02:32.511 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>team sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will never give up control.</v>

50
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>And this is the problem for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in sales.</v>

51
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to seed any level of</v>

52
00:02:42.021 --> 00:02:47.021
<v Speaker 1>control over their process to somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of sales world because they</v>

53
00:02:47.451 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>don't value those voices enough.</v>

54
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.530
<v Speaker 1>But the research is clear on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miller Heiman Institute research the</v>

55
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:57.800
<v Speaker 1>difference between good and great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They call it world class organizations.</v>

56
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they 20% more than their nearest</v>

57
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>competitor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing they have in common is</v>

58
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>they've broken this myth and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that every deal is about</v>

59
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>rapid problem solving and no one person</v>
<v Speaker 1>can solve the problem on their own</v>

60
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other two myths of creativity that</v>

61
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:18.751
<v Speaker 1>must be dispelled is the Eureka moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no such thing as a big idea</v>

62
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>that changes the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is another one of those</v>

63
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:24.610
<v Speaker 1>hurtful but very true based on empirical</v>
<v Speaker 1>research points.</v>

64
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.070
<v Speaker 1>There are little ideas that combine with</v>
<v Speaker 1>other little ideas that improve</v>

65
00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>themselves into game changing ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've experienced this personally,</v>

66
00:03:34.421 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>but who I consider a one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities on creativity.</v>

67
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ed catmull,</v>

68
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.730
<v Speaker 1>president of Pixar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember standing backstage a few</v>

69
00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>years ago just gushing to him about John</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lasseter.</v>

70
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Lasseter,</v>

71
00:03:46.331 --> 00:03:48.190
<v Speaker 1>his vp of creative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

72
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:50.590
<v Speaker 1>he's the bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy who wrote wally the</v>

73
00:03:50.591 --> 00:03:52.510
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the guy that wrote the script</v>

74
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>for toy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

75
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>telling the story from the toys point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view and that remember catmull looked at</v>

76
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.990
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut me off,</v>

77
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:03.991
<v Speaker 1>and not to dismiss lassiner he said toy</v>
<v Speaker 1>story was a problematic idea from the</v>

78
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make an entire full length feature film</v>

79
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 1>inside a computer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand how hard that is from</v>

80
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>a rendering time standpoint?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make the characters as human as human.</v>

81
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even have facial controller</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology at the time for this and tell</v>

82
00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>the story from the toys point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we've never historically had a toy,</v>

83
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.270
<v Speaker 1>I have any narrative for us to draw on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaton will explain that.</v>

84
00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Nine months in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they shut the film down after a meeting</v>

85
00:04:30.431 --> 00:04:32.950
<v Speaker 1>with Disney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they called it black Friday and then cat</v>

86
00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>moe said something to me that shattered</v>
<v Speaker 1>the myth of the Eureka moment.</v>

87
00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Capital said toy story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The movie you saw was a thousand</v>

88
00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.800
<v Speaker 1>problems solved and it was like it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bolt of lightning.</v>

89
00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

90
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>When you do a million dollar deal and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>ad agency,</v>

91
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not a big idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a hundred problems solved.</v>

92
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>80 of them are inside your agency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you move through every level of that</v>

93
00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>sale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get obstacles in front of you and</v>

94
00:04:59.471 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>what this means is that if we no longer</v>
<v Speaker 1>depend on the big idea to fall out of</v>

95
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>the sky and change the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we meet more.</v>

96
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>We think more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we research more,</v>

97
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>we subtle with small pieces of progress</v>
<v Speaker 1>that add up to momentum.</v>

98
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third myth of genius or creativity</v>

99
00:05:17.171 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>that must be shattered if you want to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more collaborative,</v>

100
00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>is the myth of the expert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

101
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:25.660
<v Speaker 1>I believe in involving people in a deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strom,</v>

102
00:05:25.661 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>who we think are experts on the problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

103
00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>But if you notice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want experts on the solution</v>

104
00:05:31.031 --> 00:05:36.031
<v Speaker 1>space because most of the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions to vexing problems come from</v>

105
00:05:36.521 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>the edges of a domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know people that don't know what</v>

106
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.850
<v Speaker 1>they don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're not limited by these false</v>

107
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:47.110
<v Speaker 1>constraints that hold people back that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the middle of this subject.</v>

108
00:05:47.111 --> 00:05:50.680
<v Speaker 1>So the way I like to think about it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could talk to a fish,</v>

109
00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.900
<v Speaker 1>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the fish could respond,</v>

110
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>if it could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you walked up to a fish in a fish</v>

111
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>bowl and you asked the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's the water?</v>

112
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 1>The fish would look at you puzzled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask you what's water?</v>

113
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People that are so steeped in a domain,</v>

114
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the expansive</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that allows them to</v>

115
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>recognize patterns and convergence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because every invention,</v>

116
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>every solution is really about pattern</v>
<v Speaker 1>or convergence recognition and so it's</v>

117
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:22.640
<v Speaker 1>really important for us to follow the</v>
<v Speaker 1>following mantra and collaboration.</v>

118
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Ideas can come from anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

119
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>in dealstorming that is one of my four</v>
<v Speaker 1>key ground rules.</v>

120
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:36.710
<v Speaker 1>It's just as important as stay on agenda</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't distract the person next to</v>

121
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:41.711
<v Speaker 1>you because the problem with the myth of</v>
<v Speaker 1>expert is it leads to not invented here</v>

122
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>dismissal of good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're in a deal store meeting</v>

123
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:48.950
<v Speaker 1>and someone who's on the edge of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>

124
00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll just give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone out of finance that generally</v>

125
00:06:52.821 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>handles something as mundane as revenue</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition.</v>

126
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>They come to one of your meetings</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you have a problem related to</v>

127
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>how you recognize their revenue of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal or whatever and you're in the</v>

128
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>middle of this conversation about</v>
<v Speaker 1>packaging and they come up with a really</v>

129
00:07:05.691 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>novel way to think about how it's built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might look at that person and say,</v>

130
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything about billing</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales.</v>

131
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:14.390
<v Speaker 1>You're just a revenue recognition</v>
<v Speaker 1>analyst.</v>

132
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:18.470
<v Speaker 1>We know billing and sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're about to shut him down for the</v>

133
00:07:18.471 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>rest of the meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what you don't understand is that he</v>

134
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 1>may have an educational background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He may have had previous jobs,</v>

135
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 1>he may have a significant other that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>steeped in the billing expertise,</v>

136
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>and he's drawing upon all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The minute you tell someone,</v>

137
00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>only experts can weigh in with ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who's not an expert stops</v>

138
00:07:37.131 --> 00:07:39.350
<v Speaker 1>contributing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in my experience,</v>

139
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>it breaks down collaboration.</v>
