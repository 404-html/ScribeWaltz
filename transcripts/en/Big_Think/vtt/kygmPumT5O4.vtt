1
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>It's really tough to answer that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to trust your impressions</v>

2
00:00:16.351 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 1>in real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

3
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 1>in the conservative world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paper was starting to say already see,</v>

4
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all going to work in Iraq and</v>

5
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 1>everybody's gonna thank Bush for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm skeptical of that.</v>

6
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I think the war in Iraq will look like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake by Bush.</v>

7
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

8
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

9
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>generally his,</v>

10
00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
<v Speaker 1>his approach and foreign policy to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>as shoe diplomacy and go with unilateral</v>
<v Speaker 1>force will,</v>

12
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.010
<v Speaker 1>will be seen as having been</v>
<v Speaker 1>counterproductive and having decreased</v>

13
00:00:59.011 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>rather than increased American influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

14
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:07.191
<v Speaker 1>So I would predict he would be seen as</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather unsuccessful president in the</v>

15
00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>realm of foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the realm of domestic policy,</v>

16
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 1>but in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by far the most important thing he's</v>

17
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.090
<v Speaker 1>done is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is uh,</v>

18
00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>the no child left behind law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been wildly under covered by</v>

19
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:23.064
<v Speaker 1>the press.</v>

20
00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.550
<v Speaker 1>And that'll take years to sift out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But basically what he has done is it's a</v>

21
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>little bit like Nixon to China because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>that are Republican president did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

23
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>say for the first time we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the federal government a really</v>

24
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:45.910
<v Speaker 1>forceful dispositive presence in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American public school system.</v>

25
00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:46.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

26
00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>and really this will be seen as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment when we western Europeanized</v>

27
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:56.500
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and went from being a place</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

28
00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>that where public education is seen as</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely local function to,</v>

29
00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it a much more of a national</v>

30
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>function.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

31
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>and that'll play out in all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting ways,</v>

32
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.080
<v Speaker 1>whether good or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
