00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>When I wrote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was primarily focused on the,</v>

2
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>on the business situation because I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at how companies can grow and</v>

3
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>prosper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it seemed that empathy was the</v>

4
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>biggest differentiator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

5
00:00:19.731 --> 00:00:24.731
<v Speaker 1>what I've been most surprised about is</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much empathy is become a larger</v>

6
00:00:25.611 --> 00:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>trend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that is being focused on at</v>

7
00:00:27.441 --> 00:00:32.300
<v Speaker 1>the highest levels of government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even a Barack Obama has become our chief</v>

8
00:00:32.301 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>empathy officer for the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.340
<v Speaker 1>and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just been amazing to see when he</v>

10
00:00:37.341 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>was at the saddleback ranch last year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rick Warren asked him,</v>

11
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:43.380
<v Speaker 1>why do you want to be pressed at it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.080
<v Speaker 1>the number one reason he gave was</v>
<v Speaker 1>because his grandmother had taught him</v>

13
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.680
<v Speaker 1>the value of empathy and he felt that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needed to be brought back to</v>

14
00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.970
<v Speaker 1>government and to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>and when he was asked to choose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>supreme court nominee,</v>

16
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.030
<v Speaker 1>Obama said that he was looking for</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who first and foremost had a</v>

17
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>sense of empathy.</v>

18
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And this is a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People kind of flipped out on both sides</v>

19
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>of the aisle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does he mean by empathy?</v>

20
00:01:09.101 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>What is empathy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good thing.</v>

21
00:01:10.701 --> 00:01:11.810
<v Speaker 1>Is it a bad thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

22
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 1>your people on the right saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

23
00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:15.530
<v Speaker 1>by empathy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he means we want someone who's a</v>

24
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>pushover and that's a sign of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong with this country.</v>

25
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:23.450
<v Speaker 1>It seems like empathy has gotten a bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>rap over the last 50 years in America.</v>

26
00:01:23.451 --> 00:01:27.860
<v Speaker 1>We've kind of confused it with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Touchy feely or soft minded.</v>

27
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.521
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

28
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>what it really means is Jesse intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to connect with other people.</v>

29
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>And Barack gets that and I think he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>leading us to a different place.</v>

30
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a sign of Obama's ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>connect with people that we don't call</v>

31
00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:43.680
<v Speaker 1>him President Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We call him barack.</v>

32
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>The people I know referring to him by</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first name.</v>

33
00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:47.180
<v Speaker 1>Like he's one of us.</v>
