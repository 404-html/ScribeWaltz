1
00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>I think that the importance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses social role is growing very,</v>

2
00:00:17.591 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>very rapidly and there's only going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to expand.</v>

3
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there will come a time in the</v>

4
00:00:23.471 --> 00:00:27.910
<v Speaker 1>very near future within five to eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>years when almost every single major</v>

5
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 1>company will simply have to pick up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>social glove and acknowledge what their</v>

6
00:00:33.611 --> 00:00:38.611
<v Speaker 1>social role contribution footprint is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't be able to bolt it on and</v>

7
00:00:41.591 --> 00:00:41.981
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

8
00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>we're a good company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or say,</v>

9
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please talk to my csr,</v>

10
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Executive Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a corporate social responsibility.</v>

11
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.570
<v Speaker 1>It will executive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It will get more and more important and</v>

12
00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:57.571
<v Speaker 1>more and more wired into the DNA of</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations of why for two really</v>

13
00:00:58.031 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>important reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

14
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>consumers and employees are demanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

15
00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:06.490
<v Speaker 1>particularly most notably millennials</v>
<v Speaker 1>who want to work for companies that are</v>

16
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:09.820
<v Speaker 1>making a difference and who simply won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>devote their time or invest their energy</v>

17
00:01:09.821 --> 00:01:13.210
<v Speaker 1>and companies that are not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in companies that pretend to be an</v>

18
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:15.070
<v Speaker 1>aren't really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

19
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.070
<v Speaker 1>so and consumers are going to vote</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly,</v>

20
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:23.071
<v Speaker 1>particularly if we continue on this sea</v>
<v Speaker 1>of disillusionment with this massive app</v>

21
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned with our government in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face of a massive advocation of</v>

22
00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:28.564
<v Speaker 1>stewardship.</v>

23
00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.510
<v Speaker 1>As consumers get more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>disillusioned with government,</v>

24
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker 1>they're more and more interested to use</v>
<v Speaker 1>other avenues to vote with their dollars</v>

25
00:01:35.531 --> 00:01:39.670
<v Speaker 1>or vote with their feet or make a</v>
<v Speaker 1>positive difference in a world in which</v>

26
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>that difference is so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the first reason is consumers and</v>

27
00:01:42.611 --> 00:01:47.050
<v Speaker 1>employees are demanding it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second reason is the world.</v>

28
00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:50.290
<v Speaker 1>The planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the collective global village can't</v>

29
00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:55.291
<v Speaker 1>really survive the next 20 years and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain itself without the knowledge,</v>

30
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.660
<v Speaker 1>the resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the power of business and businesses.</v>

31
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>Social problems are now business</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

32
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:04.481
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Samuel Johnson once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing so focused as a man's thoughts</v>

34
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.190
<v Speaker 1>like the prospect of hanging well with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environmental system.</v>

35
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And the global financial system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have two very important ticking time</v>

36
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>bombs and and there are many others that</v>
<v Speaker 1>flow out of that are that are there that</v>

37
00:02:20.981 --> 00:02:23.290
<v Speaker 1>are part of the global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

38
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:24.340
<v Speaker 1>challenges ahead.</v>

39
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 1>But we simply cannot navigate those</v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>

40
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.780
<v Speaker 1>We can't solve the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can't build a sustainable future for</v>

41
00:02:31.781 --> 00:02:34.360
<v Speaker 1>our kids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much less our grandkids if we don't have</v>

42
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 1>a have business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

43
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.110
<v Speaker 1>very involved literally out the social</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the village,</v>

44
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>at the school level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that that the social role</v>

45
00:02:46.931 --> 00:02:48.040
<v Speaker 1>of business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

46
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.380
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is an enormous issue.</v>

47
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.260
<v Speaker 1>But I think finally the lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

48
00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 1>particularly large banks right now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wake of the last year and a half,</v>

49
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:02.070
<v Speaker 1>and then the wake of what many of us</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of an astounding behavior on the</v>

50
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>part of banking executives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think large banks are hustling to find</v>

51
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>good bolt on for their social</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizenship and their social role.</v>

52
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And I also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think bolt bolt-ons add on.</v>

53
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Let me brush up but tarnished reputation</v>
<v Speaker 1>by throwing money at x or y.</v>

54
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>cause I think consumers and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other folks are real quick to pick that</v>

55
00:03:25.841 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>up and to and to call a spade a spade</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see it for exactly what it is.</v>
