00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>When we were in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a warlord who was 14 years old</v>

2
00:00:20.741 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>and he had just taken over his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>his villages from his father who had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been killed,</v>

4
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a couple of weeks before we met</v>

5
00:00:28.781 --> 00:00:31.030
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's in a very remote region,</v>

6
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>just south of the instrument pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a dividing a range,</v>

7
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between those Taliban held a series of</v>

8
00:00:39.701 --> 00:00:44.560
<v Speaker 1>hills that were Taliban held in a series</v>
<v Speaker 1>of hills that were held by his villages.</v>

9
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.320
<v Speaker 1>And he took us up to the place where his</v>
<v Speaker 1>father had been sniped and well made it</v>

10
00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:54.700
<v Speaker 1>a big point of pride to stand at the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the mountain where his father had</v>

11
00:00:54.701 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>been shot a couple of weeks ago and sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of almost daring the Taliban who were</v>

12
00:00:58.781 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>shooting at us from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.620
<v Speaker 1>from the opposing hillside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 1>we were sort of ducking and covering.</v>

15
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this young 14 year old wanted to show us</v>

16
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:10.510
<v Speaker 1>that he wasn't afraid to stand in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact spot where his father had been</v>

17
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:12.040
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

18
00:01:12.041 --> 00:01:14.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the only way to get up</v>

19
00:01:14.621 --> 00:01:15.120
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was on,</v>

20
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>on horseback and I'm new equestrian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

21
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was able to sort of hang onto this</v>

22
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:25.381
<v Speaker 1>horse photographers with is a Irish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a photographer,</v>

23
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.480
<v Speaker 1>unable to ride a horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he was on a donkey and,</v>

25
00:01:31.481 --> 00:01:33.640
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was terrifying.</v>

26
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.220
<v Speaker 1>It was funny because I was watching him</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a document.</v>

27
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:39.600
<v Speaker 1>It's terrifying because they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>shooting at us and he was a [inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>name is seamus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's a fantastic photographer who</v>

29
00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:46.140
<v Speaker 1>later became a great equestrian because</v>
<v Speaker 1>he learned his lesson and Afghan.</v>
