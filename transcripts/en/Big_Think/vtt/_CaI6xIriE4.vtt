1
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>I think the big difference between Iraq</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Vietnam,</v>

2
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I said after we lost and withdrew from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

3
00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:21.760
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to follow us home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very clear.</v>

4
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>If you read bin Ladin Sarkar ways are</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're hearing these other people,</v>

5
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.160
<v Speaker 1>they want to follow us home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They view Iraq as a stepping stone to</v>

6
00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the dimensions of the conflict have</v>

7
00:00:33.311 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>changed dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's eerie in a way.</v>

8
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Some of the comparisons to the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>stages of the Vietnam War and the</v>

9
00:00:41.321 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>strategy that was used and the Rumsfeld</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>

10
00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>there were both failed strategies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were very similar and so the on the</v>

11
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:53.500
<v Speaker 1>ground that's a little bit eerie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was called search and destroy and</v>

12
00:00:53.501 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went out and killed bad guys and</v>

13
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:59.230
<v Speaker 1>came back to base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what Rumsfeld was strategy was</v>

14
00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:04.231
<v Speaker 1>doing before then we got General Abrams</v>
<v Speaker 1>says the head of the military in Vietnam</v>

15
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:10.561
<v Speaker 1>and they went out and they went out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they secured areas and they stayed and</v>

16
00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>they allowed the normal life to begin.</v>

17
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the same thing that ha that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know strategy in Vietnam under general,</v>

18
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.600
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq under General Patraeus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd go out and we secure an area and we</v>

19
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:28.000
<v Speaker 1>patrol all the time with Iraqi military</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we don't leave.</v>

20
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>It caused an upsurge in casualties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are now coming way back down</v>

21
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.130
<v Speaker 1>because the strategy is succeeding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That happened with General Abrams to in</v>

22
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam War that people ran out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>patience and demanded that we do nothing</v>

23
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though our troops had already</v>

24
00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:48.880
<v Speaker 1>withdrawn from the in this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

25
00:01:48.881 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>will it get Baghdad clock and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Clark be the same and that's</v>

26
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>not clear to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although we have beat back the Democrats</v>

27
00:01:56.591 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>effort to set a date for withdrawal is</v>
<v Speaker 1>shorter time ago.</v>

28
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:02.410
<v Speaker 1>It was last week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the other part though that is</v>

29
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:06.490
<v Speaker 1>most heartening to me use America is</v>
<v Speaker 1>very divided about this war,</v>

30
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>but none of us are divided in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>support of the men and women who are</v>

31
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>serving in uniform and unfortunately in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam war,</v>

32
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm proud not only of these young men</v>

33
00:02:19.571 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>and women who are serving because of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best of America,</v>

34
00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>but I'm proud of America in that we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting these young men and women.</v>

35
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 1>No matter how we feel about the war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's right or wrong.</v>

36
00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something that's very,</v>

37
00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:37.660
<v Speaker 1>very important and one that I can't tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you how much</v>

38
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.500
<v Speaker 2>appreciate it.</v>
