1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think collectively we should be all</v>

2
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>together at the table much more often</v>
<v Speaker 1>than we are because I think that the</v>

3
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:19.751
<v Speaker 1>table is a such a magnet for interaction</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the family onto world issues.</v>

4
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Ford is a conduit to a venue that</v>

5
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>we can sort of permeate each other's</v>
<v Speaker 1>thoughts and all that.</v>

6
00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>So at the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning with the family and the</v>

7
00:00:35.241 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eating together to the leaders,</v>

8
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.670
<v Speaker 1>eating each other's food at the table</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe discussing,</v>

9
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:41.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the point,</v>

10
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:46.931
<v Speaker 1>an issue over a nice bowl of pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think individually we should have a</v>

11
00:00:49.101 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>consciousness of herself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of her body,</v>

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>of living well and using food to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>them in a positive fashion.</v>

13
00:00:58.701 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>using food to give us pleasure using</v>

14
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.510
<v Speaker 1>food to lose those few pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoyably not in a negative negotiation</v>

15
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>because I think today food is a negated</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot,</v>

16
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.211
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

17
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

18
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>food is yes,</v>

19
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:16.461
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

20
00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the right food is the right amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the right time.</v>
