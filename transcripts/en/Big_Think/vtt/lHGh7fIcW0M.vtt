00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 1>findings in my book and my research is</v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:08.640
<v Speaker 1>that innovator is fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>misunderstand human capital as an asset,</v>

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>human capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a resource.</v>

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.530
<v Speaker 1>The majority of organizations that want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to innovate,</v>

5
00:00:13.531 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>say we need to get innovators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to improve the capabilities and</v>

6
00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.960
<v Speaker 1>competencies of our employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to hire people who are willing</v>

7
00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>to take a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

8
00:00:23.491 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>It's such and be innovative and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole notion of,</v>

9
00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our competitive advantage in this post</v>

10
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>industrial era is that we have better</v>
<v Speaker 1>human capital than our competitors.</v>

11
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google has better people than IBM has</v>

12
00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>better people than apple has better</v>
<v Speaker 1>people than Amazon and blah,</v>

13
00:00:39.421 --> 00:00:39.691
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

14
00:00:39.691 --> 00:00:39.961
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

15
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.794
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>I submit that's the exact wrong way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at it.</v>

17
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Not that it's wrong in the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>false but wrong in the way of being</v>

18
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.673
<v Speaker 1>incomplete.</v>

19
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 1>What about your customers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human capital.</v>

20
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>What about your clients?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human capital,</v>

21
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>the Good Duncan experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thought experiment I want people to</v>

22
00:01:02.581 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>get very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very serious consideration to is what if</v>

23
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>we stopped thinking of innovation as</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's new and valuable that</v>

24
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.920
<v Speaker 1>we market and sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what if we start thinking about</v>

25
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>innovation as an investment in the human</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital capabilities and competencies of</v>

26
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>our customers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

27
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Henry Ford transformed the factory</v>
<v Speaker 1>production system with mass production</v>

28
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>of the automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model t,</v>

29
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>the model a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. And everybody celebrates that as a</v>

30
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>milestone in business history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I submit that economic historians,</v>

31
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>business historians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marketers miss the essential point.</v>

32
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Henry ford didn't just enAble the mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>production of automobiles.</v>

33
00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>He facilitated the mass creation of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human capital of driving.</v>

34
00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>everybody drives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an asset.</v>

35
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>It transforms markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It transforms individual and</v>

36
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.470
<v Speaker 1>organizational capabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do we not spend as much time</v>

37
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:11.661
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the human capital and adding</v>
<v Speaker 1>value to the human capital of our</v>

38
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>customers and our clients as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>our employees.</v>

39
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the essential innovation</v>
<v Speaker 1>takeaway.</v>

40
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.970
<v Speaker 1>How do our innovations transform the</v>
<v Speaker 1>human capital of our customers,</v>

41
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>not just the human capital of the people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who work for us and with us.</v>

42
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.900
<v Speaker 1>The reason why I came up with a design</v>
<v Speaker 1>horistic making customers better makes</v>

43
00:02:33.901 --> 00:02:38.901
<v Speaker 1>better customers is because I wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>help innovative organizations filter and</v>

44
00:02:40.651 --> 00:02:45.651
<v Speaker 1>prioritize their innovation investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not enough to make your customer</v>

45
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.430
<v Speaker 1>better if you don't reap the benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that investment.</v>

46
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're just making it better customer,</v>

47
00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>that's exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what you're trying to do is align an</v>

48
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:06.151
<v Speaker 1>innovation investment that makes your</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer measurably better in some way</v>

49
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>that matters to that customer in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways that matters for that client,</v>

50
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time,</v>

51
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:15.550
<v Speaker 1>you're making that customer more</v>
<v Speaker 1>valuable to themselves.</v>

52
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 1>you're making them more valuable to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>by making them a better customer.</v>

53
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>You're making them a better customer for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

54
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Making customers better makes better</v>
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>
