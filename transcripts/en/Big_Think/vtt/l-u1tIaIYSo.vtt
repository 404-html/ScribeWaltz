00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.730
<v Speaker 1>I've never made a mistake in my career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.551
<v Speaker 1>Geez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

3
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>I really do tend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have made lots and lots of mistakes,</v>

4
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>but I tend to erase them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as from my,</v>

6
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.610
<v Speaker 1>from my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mind,</v>

8
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day I make a mistake as I try to</v>

10
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>write a piece of fiction or is I try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>write a story.</v>

11
00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

12
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>and on a larger sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make mistakes thinking that,</v>

13
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

14
00:00:36.331 --> 00:00:40.770
<v Speaker 1>I've done this kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore of course I can do this</v>

15
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 1>roughly similar adjacent thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

16
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>it's the mistakes of Hubris I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>it's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to my mind,</v>

19
00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:53.600
<v Speaker 1>it's better to make those mistakes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

20
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now maybe I can't,</v>

21
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tap dance,</v>

22
00:00:57.691 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 1>even though I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>can tell jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>it's better to make those mistakes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attempt to,</v>

25
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>to live the amateur spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>

26
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>a then to a stick in one little silo</v>
<v Speaker 1>where one has proven oneself.</v>

27
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

28
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the errors of hacked them are,</v>

29
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>are more dangerous than the errors of</v>
<v Speaker 1>overreach.</v>

30
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.920
<v Speaker 1>And I've over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've overreached I will grant.</v>
