<v Speaker 1>Hey Bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my name is Thomas and I'm from Los</v>

2
00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

3
00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:11.320
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering if mathematics is</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly universal.</v>

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not disputing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just really wondering if,</v>

5
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics such as calculus a really</v>

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same near the edges of the</v>

7
00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:25.660
<v Speaker 1>universe for all that we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

8
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like near black holes.</v>

9
00:00:27.431 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Does Matthew do mathematical laws?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.680
<v Speaker 1>breakdown?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.673
<v Speaker 1>thanks</v>

12
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 2>Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a great question about</v>

13
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 2>mathematics as far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works everywhere.</v>

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

15
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 2>if we go to a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you suggested,</v>

16
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 2>near a black hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the edge of the universe and mathematics</v>

17
00:00:47.101 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would say to ourselves,</v>

18
00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's just mathematics that we don't</v>

19
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:54.420
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to add some more,</v>

20
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 2>more math to our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

21
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 2>to our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

22
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Kennan of mathematical equations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very reasonable that there's math</v>

23
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 2>that nobody knows how it works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just understand that when it comes</v>

24
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:14.781
<v Speaker 2>to the motion of planets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to how rockets work,</v>

25
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:19.470
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the paths of comets and</v>
<v Speaker 2>asteroids and meteors,</v>

26
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 2>we understand this stuff inside out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

27
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it was only in the 16 hundreds that</v>
<v Speaker 2>these discoveries were made.</v>

28
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.700
<v Speaker 2>you'll also hear people talk all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time about the singularity,</v>

30
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.660
<v Speaker 2>the singularity.</v>

31
00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And this is to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is when you get one over zero and one</v>

32
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 2>over zero is infinite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or it is unknowable.</v>

33
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 2>And I'll give you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

34
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's 1000?</v>

35
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 2>What's bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One 10th or 1000th a 10th is bigger than</v>

36
00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:56.520
<v Speaker 2>a thousandth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

37
00:01:56.521 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

38
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:02.391
<v Speaker 2>what's bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 2>1000th or one 10000th a thousandth has</v>

39
00:02:03.751 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

40
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:10.131
<v Speaker 2>Now what about one over one 10000th</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 10,000,</v>

41
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>but at one over 1000000th is 1,000,001</v>
<v Speaker 2>over a billion visibility.</v>

42
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 2>So as the number gets smaller and</v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller,</v>

43
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 2>that total the inverse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

44
00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

45
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:26.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>denominator causes the total,</v>

46
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 2>the quantity to become a bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so if it's over a zero,</v>

47
00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 2>it would become infinity or infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And nobody knows what happens at</v>

48
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>infinity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what happens exactly at the</v>

49
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Speaker 2>singularity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

50
00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 2>people speculate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

51
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.991
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

52
00:02:42.991 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 2>as near as we can tell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>math applies everywhere.</v>

53
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 2>That is a great question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
