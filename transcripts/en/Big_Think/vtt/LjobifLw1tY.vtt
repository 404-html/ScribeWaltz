1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I never forget</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking a doctor,</v>

2
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I have a novelist once.</v>

3
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think a new row c says?</v>

4
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>An Eddie said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the endless repetition of an</v>

5
00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:27.201
<v Speaker 1>obsolete experience are failing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the trouble with age drives we get</v>

6
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>as children</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there often</v>

7
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>come about</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some emotional reason,</v>

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>having to do okay with gang gaining our</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents love or respect or something.</v>

9
00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not the real thing.</v>

10
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 1>The real thing is just to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>spontaneously love,</v>

11
00:00:57.511 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>not to have to go through this enormous</v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

12
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's air sacs.</v>

13
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:05.200
<v Speaker 1>It's artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

14
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>And You keep repeating it and repeating</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

15
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>repeating it because it isn't real</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.910
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's true in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes,</v>

17
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.160
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you develop they just neurotic</v>

18
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>pattern Jew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>You keep repeating these earlier</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns,</v>

20
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often too.</v>

21
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>Either no end at all or to an end that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has very little to do with the,</v>

22
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.780
<v Speaker 1>and you're really after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

23
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're all strangers to our unconscious</v>

24
00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:43.224
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.610
<v Speaker 1>try to go back and understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what we're doing.</v>

26
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Started decades and decades to go.</v>

27
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For reasons or motivations that have</v>

28
00:01:57.881 --> 00:02:02.560
<v Speaker 1>very little to do with today and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of that is relevant and how much is</v>

29
00:02:02.561 --> 00:02:03.394
<v Speaker 1>excessive.</v>

30
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
