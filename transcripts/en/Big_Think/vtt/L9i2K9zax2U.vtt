1
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the service that you provide to</v>

2
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

3
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very important to be objective and</v>

4
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>clear thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to get lost in the two great dangers</v>

5
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>that we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in Irish society,</v>

6
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>one of which is wishful thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

7
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>we are always thinking that the world</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything is going to be better</v>

8
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>than it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is hype.</v>

9
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans tend to hype everything as a</v>

10
00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>result of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do not have a sense of proper</v>

11
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>proportion and we overdo things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>the classic example right now is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack on nine slash 11.</v>

13
00:00:54.391 --> 00:00:57.840
<v Speaker 1>It was a terrible thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was only a terrorist attack.</v>

14
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>And yet the number of people in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country who have referred to this as the</v>

15
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.891
<v Speaker 1>beginning of world war three and use</v>
<v Speaker 1>that as an excuse for the military</v>

16
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>adventures that were in abroad now is I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think just astonishing.</v>

17
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hype in this country,</v>

18
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>the sensationalism continually confuses</v>
<v Speaker 1>us and causes us to make enormous areas.</v>

19
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.590
<v Speaker 1>And my philosophy is avoid those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all costs.</v>
