00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.060
<v Speaker 1>Real concern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few things came together.</v>

2
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>One is that I spent a lot of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking at the environmental trends and</v>

3
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that you can do in an</v>

4
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.430
<v Speaker 1>academic environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have time to reflect,</v>

5
00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:27.431
<v Speaker 1>and I've been in this field since 1970</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I'd look back and see how</v>

6
00:00:27.741 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>we were doing and what I found was that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really a,</v>

7
00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>despite his growing strengthen</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental community,</v>

8
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 1>the growing sophistication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the growing number of groups here,</v>

9
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:44.321
<v Speaker 1>we find ourselves 40 years later on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>verge of losing the planet,</v>

10
00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have really ruining this place for our</v>

11
00:00:47.511 --> 00:00:52.070
<v Speaker 1>children and grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the data point in the wrong</v>

12
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:54.500
<v Speaker 1>directions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was one thing.</v>

13
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>The other conclusion that I came to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of that really is that the way</v>

14
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:05.021
<v Speaker 1>we're going about environmentalism in</v>
<v Speaker 1>our country today is not going to</v>

15
00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>suffice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could double the efforts of the types</v>

16
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:12.970
<v Speaker 1>of things that we do now in mainstream</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental racism.</v>

17
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>And it would improve things marginally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would not carry the day would not</v>

18
00:01:18.831 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>win where we need to win.</v>
