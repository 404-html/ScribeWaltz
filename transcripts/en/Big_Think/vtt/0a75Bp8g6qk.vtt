00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>Alex in 94 I remember to cover.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we had divided,</v>

2
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the White House in the hands of Bill</v>

3
00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>Clinton and then congress in the hands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Newt Gingrich.</v>

4
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

5
00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:23.694
<v Speaker 1>I certainly think that all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trends at the moment for a </v>

6
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.423
<v Speaker 1>democratic sweep in November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we should take anything </v>

7
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>for granted because John McCain is still</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

8
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.243
<v Speaker 1>very much seen in the media as the John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mccain of 2000 and not the John Mccain </v>

9
00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:45.460
<v Speaker 1>of 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is definitely very likely.</v>

11
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:49.224
<v Speaker 1>And therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Lou real leadership is exercise is a </v>

12
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:53.184
<v Speaker 1>very good chance that we could end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with finally having some from low </v>

13
00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.863
<v Speaker 1>universal health care insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is desperately needed in this </v>

14
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>country for the 7 million people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninsured.</v>

15
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.753
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.133
<v Speaker 1>also that we would be able to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to energy independence and bring </v>

17
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom from Iraq,</v>

18
00:01:14.521 --> 00:01:15.750
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I thing is,</v>

19
00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>has to be our number one action.</v>
