1
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general terms,</v>

2
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the business of really creating</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectual capital or creating ideas,</v>

3
00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for uh,</v>

4
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>looking at a different way at very</v>
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.120
<v Speaker 1>messy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated problems,</v>

6
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>all of which have something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition and,</v>

7
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic value and,</v>

8
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>really delivering value in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations working.</v>

10
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.883
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

12
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started out with a fairly focused,</v>

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>although very complicated question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes some industries prosper.</v>

15
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>None others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>and then later what makes some companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosper and others,</v>

17
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately that,</v>

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.780
<v Speaker 1>that core set of ideas and frameworks</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ways of thinking gave rise to work</v>

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.990
<v Speaker 1>in some very powerfully connected areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>like economic development and,</v>

20
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.870
<v Speaker 1>and most recently in healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery.</v>

21
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare delivery is,</v>

22
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>is a large complex multidimensional</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

23
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>involves organizations delivering value</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are competing in,</v>

24
00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:17.490
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some way against other entities.</v>

25
00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:22.491
<v Speaker 1>And so that class of problems is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the ones that I've evolved my work</v>

26
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

27
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>into looking at an.</v>

28
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.200
<v Speaker 1>And although I have a hopeless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopelessly broad bandwidth and the sense</v>

29
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>of working a lot of different fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work in the environment,</v>

30
00:01:32.731 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I work in social responsibility,</v>
<v Speaker 1>philanthropy.</v>

31
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>It all emanates from that common set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives and ways of looking at an</v>

32
00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>organization's doing something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deliver value.</v>

33
00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suspect,</v>

35
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just,</v>

36
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling around the world and talking</v>

37
00:01:55.831 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 1>to people and meeting people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>probably at this moment in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably that'd be best known for</v>

39
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of the five forces because</v>

40
00:02:03.901 --> 00:02:06.620
<v Speaker 1>it's such a visible and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

41
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of a sort of clear framework</v>

42
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people encounter it,</v>

43
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden it kind of totally</v>

44
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>changes the way they look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at an industries and markets and,</v>

46
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>a lot of students get exposed to it</v>
<v Speaker 1>during their training and,</v>

48
00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>and therefore it still sticks with them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think probably the close second would</v>

49
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 1>be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the value chain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of,</v>

51
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.050
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how we think about how an entity</v>

52
00:02:37.051 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>actually creates value and think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of creating that value and in a</v>

53
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 1>systematic way.</v>

54
00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

55
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>if my roots are in economics and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's where my doctorate is in,</v>

56
00:02:47.361 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>in economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very simple conception of the</v>

57
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:52.590
<v Speaker 1>firm which is there's a production</v>
<v Speaker 1>function and there's labor capital</v>

58
00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>that's converted into output and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

59
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine for many economic</v>

60
00:02:57.181 --> 00:02:59.010
<v Speaker 1>applications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to really understand,</v>

61
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>thinking about strategy and competition</v>
<v Speaker 1>and value,</v>

62
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>you need to go beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think probably that then would come</v>

63
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diamond theory for looking at</v>

64
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>locations and clusters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a close cousin.</v>

65
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 1>So there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been a succession of these,</v>

66
00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.820
<v Speaker 1>of these frameworks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not done.</v>

68
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

69
00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

70
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>I keep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I keep pounding away at these kinds of</v>

71
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>problems because what I find is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

72
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.110
<v Speaker 1>as we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we think about how ideas develop it,</v>

73
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>certainly in the economic and managerial</v>
<v Speaker 1>domain,</v>

74
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.590
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a tendency to reduction reduced,</v>

75
00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>to simplify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

76
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>to partition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to specialize,</v>

77
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>to look at the piece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>

78
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Not the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

79
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>rolling Christiansen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

80
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my beloved mentor,</v>

81
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was his sermon almost everyday in</v>

82
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>class that it's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the parts are important,</v>

83
00:03:52.721 --> 00:03:54.790
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something unique about the whole</v>

84
00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>and how you think about the whole and</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you get the parts to fit together.</v>

85
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's the essence of what creates</v>
<v Speaker 1>true success in,</v>

86
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.620
<v Speaker 1>in most situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

87
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>it's that struggle to understand the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole and in these interrelated domains</v>

88
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really motivates me.</v>

89
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

91
00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.610
<v Speaker 1>this is a horrendous answer for it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a strategy professor,</v>

92
00:04:18.611 --> 00:04:21.010
<v Speaker 1>but I'm working on everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

93
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:22.541
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

94
00:04:22.541 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say that I continue to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>advance,</v>

95
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of my,</v>

96
00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.680
<v Speaker 1>my major bodies of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if,</v>

97
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.560
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to identify what would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the really the,</v>

98
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dominant intellectual agenda right</v>

99
00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:39.340
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be the continuing pursuit of</v>

100
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>this kind of body of work on healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery.</v>

101
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.020
<v Speaker 1>And most recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

102
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>through some relationships with folks at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the medical school and elsewhere,</v>

103
00:04:48.491 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I've really gotten interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems of global health delivery in,</v>

104
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.290
<v Speaker 1>in developing countries settings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

105
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially looked like a totally</v>

106
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>different problem than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

107
00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.260
<v Speaker 1>healthcare in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the more deeply I think in the more</v>

108
00:05:02.261 --> 00:05:04.750
<v Speaker 1>you look at that at first principles</v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

109
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

110
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>you see that the problems are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very similar.</v>

111
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>So the hope is that we can create a</v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership which allows us to better</v>

112
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>harness the massive amounts of resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are now going into fighting</v>

113
00:05:18.011 --> 00:05:21.600
<v Speaker 1>diseases like aids and malaria and</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistant tb by,</v>

114
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.610
<v Speaker 1>by really revolutionizing our thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how to deliver care,</v>

115
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:25.683
<v Speaker 1>see the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

116
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thinking about healthcare in general</v>

117
00:05:27.941 --> 00:05:31.000
<v Speaker 1>and global health in particular has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominated by the science perspective.</v>

118
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:32.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can we come up with the better</v>

119
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:34.230
<v Speaker 1>malaria pill or a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

120
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

121
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>using drugs to treat TB.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we've come to understand is,</v>

122
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the gaining force is actually not</v>

123
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:43.990
<v Speaker 1>the science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually delivered and,</v>

124
00:05:43.991 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and delivery is complicated.</v>

125
00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You have to see it as a system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just look at the individual</v>

126
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:51.880
<v Speaker 1>parts of how you do one therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are one therapy there.</v>

127
00:05:51.881 --> 00:05:54.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to see the overall delivery</v>
<v Speaker 1>system and,</v>

128
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and research in global health has not</v>

129
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.810
<v Speaker 1>really been able to take that</v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

130
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:02.720
<v Speaker 1>just given the scientific roots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

131
00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of most,</v>

132
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:04.370
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of research.</v>

133
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the very interesting issues in,</v>

134
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:06.611
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

135
00:06:06.611 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this may be a whole new subject we</v>

136
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>could talk about for hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the nature of intellectual</v>

137
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>endeavor and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

138
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

139
00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 1>and even in business and even in</v>
<v Speaker 1>economics,</v>

140
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>we keep trying to make every problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a physics problem where,</v>

141
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>where you're down at the micro micro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>micro level and there's little particles</v>

142
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>behaving on the basis of a few forces</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can model mathematically and</v>

143
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:33.720
<v Speaker 1>then simulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>

144
00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>what we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're,</v>

145
00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.130
<v Speaker 1>what we have in most important things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

146
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>We have these complicated human systems</v>
<v Speaker 1>where there's lots of complexity and</v>

147
00:06:41.961 --> 00:06:44.630
<v Speaker 1>multidimensionality and interdependence</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

148
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:48.980
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we simply keep failing whenever we</v>

149
00:06:48.981 --> 00:06:51.590
<v Speaker 1>don't capture that in our ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking in our frameworks.</v>

150
00:06:51.591 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's Kinda what I try to do,</v>

151
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:06:54.861 --> 00:06:56.530
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with varying success and,</v>

153
00:06:56.531 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and constantly learning.</v>

154
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

155
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

156
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:06.850
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

157
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.190
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's so many interesting people</v>

158
00:07:09.191 --> 00:07:10.780
<v Speaker 1>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing interesting work and,</v>

159
00:07:10.781 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

160
00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a collectic in the sense that I think</v>

161
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:19.060
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of work can actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribute to our knowledge of these</v>

162
00:07:19.061 --> 00:07:21.700
<v Speaker 1>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

163
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

164
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.100
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the area of health,</v>

165
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think actually the practitioners are</v>

166
00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:29.080
<v Speaker 1>ahead of the theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

167
00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

168
00:07:30.641 --> 00:07:31.510
<v Speaker 1>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Farmer and partners in health I</v>

170
00:07:34.481 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 1>think are the ones that are on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>frontier of new delivery models.</v>

171
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:39.580
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't see it in the academic</v>

172
00:07:39.581 --> 00:07:41.060
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

173
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very taken with a lot of what's</v>

175
00:07:44.801 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>happening here year around the Cambridge</v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

176
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:50.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean the brode institute and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to kind of,</v>

177
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of marry science and practice in</v>

178
00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:55.260
<v Speaker 1>the human genome project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

179
00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:56.830
<v Speaker 1>I get very excited about that.</v>

180
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

181
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.480
<v Speaker 1>in the economic sphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the growing awareness that</v>

182
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.360
<v Speaker 1>people are not robots and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

183
00:08:04.361 --> 00:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>and their behavioral phenomenon that</v>
<v Speaker 1>guide,</v>

184
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people make choices in the economy.</v>

185
00:08:09.971 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 1>So the scholars that work on behavioral</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance and um,</v>

186
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's kind of simulation of,</v>

187
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.020
<v Speaker 1>of how of how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

188
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.960
<v Speaker 1>actors really make choices of which</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a number,</v>

189
00:08:19.961 --> 00:08:22.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here in Cambridge and elsewhere are</v>

190
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.650
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those are the kinds of things that</v>

191
00:08:23.651 --> 00:08:24.920
<v Speaker 1>attract me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

192
00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

193
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.220
<v Speaker 1>people that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are trying to bringing a,</v>

194
00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>kind of a fresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new perspective to a problem that was</v>

195
00:08:32.771 --> 00:08:37.771
<v Speaker 1>sort of received and well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would say that,</v>

196
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.183
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

197
00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.590
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

198
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the,</v>

199
00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:48.120
<v Speaker 1>the sort of frameworks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ideas and ways of looking at these,</v>

200
00:08:48.121 --> 00:08:49.900
<v Speaker 1>this series of problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

201
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important contribution</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that those ways of thinking have,</v>

202
00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if substantially affected and</v>

203
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:03.450
<v Speaker 1>transformed thinking in those respective</v>
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>

204
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

205
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:08.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's ultimately what I care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

206
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

207
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:11.450
<v Speaker 1>like most of us here at Hbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

208
00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:14.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm deeply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deeply rooted in practice.</v>

209
00:09:14.251 --> 00:09:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

210
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>what I really care about is not so much</v>
<v Speaker 1>the publication or the idea in its own</v>

211
00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:19.951
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

212
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but actually the ability of a practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a practitioner to do better,</v>

213
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to deliver better value,</v>

214
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.810
<v Speaker 1>the ability of a government official or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

215
00:09:27.811 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

216
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.720
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

217
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>another stake holder to actually make</v>
<v Speaker 1>better choices in terms of developing</v>

218
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:36.200
<v Speaker 1>the economy of a particular region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.670
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really changing the way people</v>

220
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.460
<v Speaker 1>think and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

221
00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing that reflected in,</v>

222
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 1>in actual practice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when I'm,</v>

223
00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I've made my biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution and I feel,</v>

224
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:50.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

225
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>that that contribution has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

226
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been meaningful.</v>

227
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

228
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.340
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

229
00:09:56.341 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that cuts across a variety of different</v>

230
00:09:58.381 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wherever,</v>

231
00:09:59.521 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>wherever that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

232
00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:03.730
<v Speaker 1>that's the contribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm the proud of stuff.</v>

233
00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 1>I think as we look at questions like</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy or,</v>

234
00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

235
00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development or,</v>

236
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

237
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>restructuring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare delivery or revitalizing</v>

238
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.370
<v Speaker 1>intercity economies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

239
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through different sets of policies.</v>

240
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:31.350
<v Speaker 1>and this may be a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is</v>

242
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.470
<v Speaker 1>always a dangerous thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that we are much closer now</v>

243
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.830
<v Speaker 1>to understanding what it is that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

244
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.140
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

245
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.510
<v Speaker 1>now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

246
00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:49.511
<v Speaker 1>the real critical questions we often</v>
<v Speaker 1>face are given even even if we know what</v>

247
00:10:51.151 --> 00:10:54.870
<v Speaker 1>works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we actually mobilize a community</v>

248
00:10:54.871 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>or a set of actors or policymakers</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do that thing.</v>

249
00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we see this an economic development all</v>

250
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:02.090
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

251
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can take,</v>

252
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.960
<v Speaker 1>take you to 10 countries and we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

253
00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:12.020
<v Speaker 1>I could literally in 15 minutes we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify six or seven critical policy</v>

254
00:11:13.111 --> 00:11:16.260
<v Speaker 1>priorities that will make an immense</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in the wellbeing of the</v>

255
00:11:16.261 --> 00:11:17.160
<v Speaker 1>citizens of that country.</v>

256
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.540
<v Speaker 1>And yet the stuff doesn't get done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't get done for a variety of</v>

257
00:11:21.541 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Partly it doesn't get done because</v>

258
00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:25.840
<v Speaker 1>people don't have the right ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bad ideas are,</v>

259
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.020
<v Speaker 1>are a huge part of the problem in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

260
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:33.500
<v Speaker 1>but it also doesn't get done because we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't understand exactly yet how change</v>

261
00:11:33.781 --> 00:11:36.600
<v Speaker 1>processes work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to mobilize those change processes.</v>

262
00:11:36.601 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's really the thing that keeps me</v>
<v Speaker 1>up at night is,</v>

263
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:41.430
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

264
00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.670
<v Speaker 1>how can we get participants in these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

265
00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>in these complex systems where there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>always multiple participants and they</v>

266
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>have to sign of agree and work together</v>
<v Speaker 1>to come up with it with a good outcome.</v>

267
00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>How do we get them working together?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of worth it.</v>

268
00:11:55.841 --> 00:12:00.841
<v Speaker 1>Chris Argyris and others who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who work on sort of change processes and</v>

269
00:12:01.211 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>constructive reasoning and how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how people can actually learn and adapt</v>

270
00:12:04.541 --> 00:12:06.750
<v Speaker 1>and change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the issues I think are,</v>

271
00:12:06.751 --> 00:12:11.200
<v Speaker 1>are really the compelling issues now in</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more aspects of society.</v>

272
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:12.140
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

273
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the what,</v>

274
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we get there?</v>

275
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:22.481
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

276
00:12:22.481 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there has been a big divide</v>
<v Speaker 1>between those who think about those who</v>

277
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:27.610
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly my,</v>

278
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:31.120
<v Speaker 1>my work and whatever success I've had is</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly because I had been able to break</v>

279
00:12:31.121 --> 00:12:35.830
<v Speaker 1>that divide a little bit and be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very informed about the phenomenon at a</v>

280
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.400
<v Speaker 1>great level of tail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

281
00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.000
<v Speaker 1>the theory and frameworks that I develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>capture complexity rather than abstract</v>

282
00:12:43.001 --> 00:12:45.010
<v Speaker 1>away the complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

283
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.520
<v Speaker 1>I wish more academics would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

284
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:51.393
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

285
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.430
<v Speaker 1>would do that would sort of live that</v>
<v Speaker 1>bridging themselves rather than see</v>

286
00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:01.960
<v Speaker 1>their role as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as solely solely the thinking part.</v>

287
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

288
00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:04.930
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

289
00:13:04.931 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to create the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>incentives and values in the fields to</v>

290
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:10.050
<v Speaker 1>do that because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

291
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.321
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

292
00:13:11.321 --> 00:13:13.990
<v Speaker 1>right now the pressures are a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite.</v>

293
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:14.893
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

294
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 1>the pressures are to specialize to focus</v>
<v Speaker 1>on refereed publications in the academy</v>

295
00:13:19.781 --> 00:13:23.250
<v Speaker 1>and you get very little credit for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for going into the field and,</v>

296
00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.490
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and engaging the practitioners and</v>

297
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:28.810
<v Speaker 1>understanding the phenomena firsthand</v>
<v Speaker 1>and therefore getting better insights</v>

298
00:13:28.811 --> 00:13:31.150
<v Speaker 1>into how to apply ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

299
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.090
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

300
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 1>that's fairly rare and very hard to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sustain so far.</v>

301
00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:41.041
<v Speaker 1>Now what you find is that the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can actually do that and we'll do that,</v>

302
00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can often have huge impact,</v>

303
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.400
<v Speaker 1>but perversely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the sort of the immediate</v>

304
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:51.430
<v Speaker 1>incentives that many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many scholars feel or are really not to</v>

305
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 1>make those investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a real,</v>

306
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.030
<v Speaker 1>it's a real challenge on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fragmentation of knowledge and ideas.</v>

307
00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

308
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.221
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

309
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:01.031
<v Speaker 1>one of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>

310
00:14:01.031 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 1>one of our compelling issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in academia but also in society</v>

311
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:06.544
<v Speaker 1>as a whole.</v>

312
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.330
<v Speaker 1>That's the market failure and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.640
<v Speaker 1>how we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how we think about solving that market</v>

314
00:14:17.641 --> 00:14:19.460
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

315
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.341
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

316
00:14:20.341 --> 00:14:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

317
00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:25.650
<v Speaker 1>I sense a glimmer of change in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some of the very young people that I</v>

318
00:14:26.161 --> 00:14:31.161
<v Speaker 1>encounter now who are more problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>focused then literature focused or,</v>

319
00:14:31.441 --> 00:14:32.030
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

320
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:34.860
<v Speaker 1>or fields focused.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

321
00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:35.940
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really,</v>

322
00:14:35.941 --> 00:14:39.930
<v Speaker 1>if your real passion is solving societal</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

323
00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:42.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a puzzle,</v>

324
00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can stay grounded in that,</v>

325
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:48.480
<v Speaker 1>that helps you kind of work across</v>
<v Speaker 1>across boundaries.</v>

326
00:14:48.481 --> 00:14:49.680
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

327
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.790
<v Speaker 1>and I think if have a new generation of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

328
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of young people who,</v>

329
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:59.290
<v Speaker 1>who really are passionate about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems that they see in the world and</v>

330
00:14:59.331 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 1>can really have that be their highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>calling,</v>

331
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:03.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that would be very optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step forward.</v>
