1
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Social Entrepreneurship is an incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting movement that was spawned by</v>

2
00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:19.281
<v Speaker 1>Bill Drayton about 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who an incredibly visionary entrepreneur</v>

3
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>who had the idea that you could really</v>
<v Speaker 1>do venture capital for the social sector</v>

4
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.691
<v Speaker 1>so you could pick for visionary</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs committed to systematic</v>

5
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:35.781
<v Speaker 1>social change who had ethical fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who were committed to social impact,</v>

6
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.690
<v Speaker 1>who were innovative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you could back them,</v>

7
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>give them some resources and the global</v>
<v Speaker 1>support system that allowed them to</v>

8
00:00:45.841 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>achieve their goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it was an environment,</v>

9
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:50.460
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

10
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple different kinds of areas of</v>

11
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.020
<v Speaker 1>social impact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this movement really rocketed</v>

12
00:00:58.021 --> 00:01:03.021
<v Speaker 1>and what allowed it to do so with both</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vision and the power of Ashoka and</v>

13
00:01:03.691 --> 00:01:08.691
<v Speaker 1>it's offshoots like a endeavor and an</v>
<v Speaker 1>acumen and other wonderful organizations</v>

14
00:01:08.791 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>that support social entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it was also the massive growth of</v>

15
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>the growth of the social sector.</v>

16
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nonprofits,</v>

17
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dramatic between 1980 and a</v>

18
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.520
<v Speaker 1>2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You basically had the number of</v>

19
00:01:23.521 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>nonprofits in Brazil go from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it was something like 5,000 to</v>

20
00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 1>nearly a million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

21
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>you had in the U,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s the number of nonprofits go from</v>

22
00:01:32.131 --> 00:01:37.131
<v Speaker 1>around 400,000 to one point 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you had this massive burgeoning of</v>

23
00:01:37.351 --> 00:01:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the social sector suddenly became a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger space with much more impact.</v>

24
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it historically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is interesting because in the 19th</v>

25
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:50.361
<v Speaker 1>century we had the industrial revolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 18th and 19th century at the</v>

26
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 20th century and with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

27
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>and with the world wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the massive growth of the state,</v>

28
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you had the burgeoning of the state,</v>

29
00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>but the social sector was left behind</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what you've had in the past decades</v>

30
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.910
<v Speaker 1>is a massive growth of that sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost an industrial revolution for that</v>

31
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:09.744
<v Speaker 1>sector.</v>

32
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that creates huge opportunities because</v>

33
00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.790
<v Speaker 1>you not only have large numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>

34
00:02:14.791 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>but organizations that can work</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

35
00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have a division of labor where you</v>

36
00:02:19.471 --> 00:02:21.390
<v Speaker 1>achieve much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

37
00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 1>what's the next way for social</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship?</v>

38
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm particularly excited by things that</v>

39
00:02:28.351 --> 00:02:32.340
<v Speaker 1>go up the next level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that help organizations to work</v>

40
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>together very effectively.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's collaborative technology</v>

41
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:39.450
<v Speaker 1>architectures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's organizations like Ashoka,</v>

42
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.370
<v Speaker 1>endeavor and acumen that helped organize</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

43
00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>help entrepreneurs to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>commonalities,</v>

44
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>show cause it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>group collaborations,</v>

45
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.640
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a financing vehicles that</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to the next level that back a whole</v>

46
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:56.580
<v Speaker 1>lot of different companies and try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>see or organizations and see the</v>

47
00:02:56.581 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>synergies between those and my companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and organizations.</v>

48
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Language is the other really exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next stage I think we're going to see a</v>

49
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:11.101
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of hybrid entities going</v>
<v Speaker 1>from zero percent returns,</v>

50
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:13.840
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight charity.</v>

51
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's appropriate because why</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

52
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 1>you know if you're trying to end</v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery,</v>

53
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to try to do it on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>profitable basis.</v>

54
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.593
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a,</v>

55
00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>a really charitable activity right</v>
<v Speaker 1>through to highly profitable areas like</v>

56
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.370
<v Speaker 1>microinsurance and microcredit where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do a and other kinds of social</v>

57
00:03:35.531 --> 00:03:40.120
<v Speaker 1>business like grameen phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mobile phone company that can be,</v>

58
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 1>all of these can be hugely profitable</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet hugely impactful.</v>

59
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>And I went to see a complete range that</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

60
00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minus 10 percent plus five percent plus</v>

61
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>20 percent plus 60 percent across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>board.</v>

62
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>That works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I happened to be most excited myself</v>

63
00:03:58.451 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 1>about the areas that really bring profit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and purpose together,</v>

64
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.400
<v Speaker 1>and the reason I'm excited about that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can do something that is hugely</v>

65
00:04:06.401 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>socially impactful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's quality and really helps people</v>

66
00:04:09.941 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>with the products you're selling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at the same time is highly</v>

67
00:04:13.151 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's massively scalable,</v>

68
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>and I'm frankly obsessed with the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there are 4 billion poor people out</v>

69
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have time to waste,</v>

70
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.350
<v Speaker 1>we have to do things at scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I want to find mechanisms that really</v>

71
00:04:28.811 --> 00:04:33.811
<v Speaker 1>allow for massive rapid scaling that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a profound impact on the poor.</v>

72
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Speaker 1>And that I think is the most exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>arrowhead of social entrepreneurship</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
