00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important issue is the one we</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>just talked about because we're so</v>
<v Speaker 1>mishandling and at this point in time</v>

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.610
<v Speaker 1>and that is what is America's proper</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in the world.</v>

4
00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>The second big issue I think is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this society is not improving.</v>

5
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we've lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow in the United States,</v>

6
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>which the puritans brought to us in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

7
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>was the notion that individual human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and societies where the largest</v>

8
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.770
<v Speaker 1>mall should always be trying to improve</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

9
00:00:42.771 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>They should be trying to learn more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should be trying to improve their</v>

10
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their service.</v>

11
00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>There are all kinds of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've kind of lost that notion so that</v>

12
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>self improvement has become a joke or it</v>
<v Speaker 1>means something like losing some weight</v>

13
00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.260
<v Speaker 1>and we have as an we focused instead on</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness and pleasure and enjoying life</v>

14
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:05.900
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a very serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem for it.</v>

15
00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.900
<v Speaker 1>We ought to talk about that and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are issues.</v>

16
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:12.590
<v Speaker 1>There was the healthcare financing</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem that we have in the United</v>

17
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is,</v>

18
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.580
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be an economic problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we have is coming up.</v>

19
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>There are those kinds of issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the really big ones are the ones</v>

20
00:01:20.541 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are we about?</v>

21
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>What are we about in the world and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we about at home?</v>
