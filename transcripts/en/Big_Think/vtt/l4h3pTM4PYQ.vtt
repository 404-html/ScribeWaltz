00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:10.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

2
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:17.081
<v Speaker 1>there was a phase in human life that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>hope is getting over with where,</v>

4
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders wanted to do the social</v>

5
00:00:20.871 --> 00:00:25.871
<v Speaker 1>engineering where the idea of communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the original idea of communism,</v>

6
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:31.181
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of Lenin Ism and Stalin Ism</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the state should control what you</v>

7
00:00:31.521 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 1>are like state was more important than</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people and should form what the</v>

8
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>

9
00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.290
<v Speaker 1>that has been a devastating hold</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>

10
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>It was the basis of nazi-ism its basis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of communism.</v>

11
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It's the basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Islamic fundamentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the opposite basis as our</v>

13
00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>founding founders and not just our</v>
<v Speaker 1>finders,</v>

14
00:00:55.341 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>but going back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>air saddle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:58.431 --> 00:01:02.450
<v Speaker 1>and that human beings have these</v>
<v Speaker 1>attributes and we should allow the</v>

17
00:01:02.451 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 1>flowering of human being and the state</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there to serve us.</v>

18
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>We're not there to serve the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very big deal.</v>

19
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very big fundamental difference.</v>

20
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.040
<v Speaker 1>Whether first words of the constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

21
00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

22
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Now in these other philosophies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's we,</v>

23
00:01:20.871 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>the state or the state does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the people,</v>

24
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:26.270
<v Speaker 1>they form the people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make the people.</v>

25
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.900
<v Speaker 1>But that's a very debilitating</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy.</v>

26
00:01:29.901 --> 00:01:34.901
<v Speaker 1>So that's generally what has been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important political fight in,</v>

27
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last century.</v>
