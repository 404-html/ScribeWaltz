1
00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm against regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3
00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that as long as we find a way to</v>

5
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.953
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.033
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>the flow of money that goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would go to a,</v>

9
00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ill conceived initiatives and obviously</v>

10
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you have to think about terrorism at</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point.</v>

11
00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's legitimate that we have</v>

12
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.510
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms to make sure that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.810
<v Speaker 1>that we have a way to track illicit or</v>
<v Speaker 1>movements or suspicious movement of</v>

14
00:00:52.221 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this delicate balance here and this</v>

15
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>is being done as we speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean probably more than we know or</v>

16
00:00:59.811 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>care to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

17
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>but other than that I think to regulate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the business sense of the word,</v>

18
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I think that game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a mistake because I</v>

19
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>obviously a convinced a capitalist</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because it's the parent because it's</v>

20
00:01:19.281 --> 00:01:21.420
<v Speaker 1>been a CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because it's,</v>

21
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have any drawbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but frankly we haven't found anything</v>

22
00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.350
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to,</v>

23
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

24
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>to rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 1>to raise the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the level of the one.</v>

26
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>So the road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the road to progress up to now is</v>

27
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>through a capitalistic system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we could find something better,</v>

28
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm wide open to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm open to it,</v>

29
00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but we have not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

30
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.090
<v Speaker 1>and the essence of the capitalist system</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that you don't want to regulate it or</v>

31
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:55.890
<v Speaker 1>at least you certainly want to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minimum to make sure that there's order</v>

32
00:01:55.891 --> 00:02:00.891
<v Speaker 1>is preserved and that again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no illegal or illicit a things are being</v>

33
00:02:02.271 --> 00:02:03.104
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

34
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.060
<v Speaker 2>Huge change.</v>

35
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.330
<v Speaker 1>globalization has an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some well known,</v>

37
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say he shares but well known</v>

38
00:02:21.211 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>statements on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the world's flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

40
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>which is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>to some extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent,</v>

42
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 1>it's true that the globalization has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we have moved for me,</v>

43
00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>national markets through a global</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

44
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>So now people think they can play</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere everywhere in the world and</v>

45
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:41.820
<v Speaker 1>they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this has created a situation where</v>

46
00:02:41.821 --> 00:02:46.120
<v Speaker 1>large global company fairly acquired a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

47
00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.950
<v Speaker 1>or power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>that is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very significant.</v>

49
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Some of them have the citizenship to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with this,</v>

50
00:02:57.241 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 1>the corporate values to deal with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them may not yet,</v>

51
00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are getting there quickly</v>

52
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>because they realize their</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility on,</v>

53
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>in the world because of their presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent that has a,</v>

55
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.610
<v Speaker 1>raised the awareness amongst the ceos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>large global companies that global</v>

56
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>corporate citizenship is very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have to deal with that and they</v>

57
00:03:27.971 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are,</v>

58
00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.230
<v Speaker 1>which is also one of the reasons they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>form is successful at attracting this</v>

59
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>interest because that's when we talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that.</v>

60
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is that</v>

62
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.050
<v Speaker 1>countries have sort of lost a fair</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of power in this globalization</v>

63
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.000
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

65
00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.880
<v Speaker 1>because of this goes across nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is,</v>

66
00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.380
<v Speaker 1>this is a change that's interesting to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to witness</v>

67
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:11.090
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some countries react a smartly to this</v>

68
00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and some not so smartly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

69
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but progressively inevitably,</v>

70
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to go into the right</v>

71
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:25.071
<v Speaker 1>direction because business is getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscious of their responsibilities and</v>

72
00:04:25.321 --> 00:04:29.820
<v Speaker 1>governance are starting to our</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding how they can really deal</v>

73
00:04:29.821 --> 00:04:34.821
<v Speaker 1>with this phenomenon more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more effectively as an opportunity</v>

74
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>rather than a threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the big difference,</v>

75
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.000
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries have gone to protectionist</v>

76
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.040
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

77
00:04:44.041 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>contain a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are industry by artificial means</v>

79
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.060
<v Speaker 1>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the solution.</v>

80
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:58.440
<v Speaker 1>The solution is to not to look at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a threat,</v>

81
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 1>but to look at it as an opportunity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who do</v>

82
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.440
<v Speaker 1>pa successful,</v>

83
00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.160
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

84
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.020
<v Speaker 1>at this point are saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

85
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.490
<v Speaker 1>we can argue whether we will or will</v>
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>

86
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>And to what extent we have recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting her name on the economic</v>

87
00:05:20.771 --> 00:05:25.300
<v Speaker 1>slowdown is always sort of artificial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we started session is two quarters</v>

88
00:05:25.301 --> 00:05:26.470
<v Speaker 1>of negative growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:29.590
<v Speaker 1>So that's an arbitrary decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so be it.</v>

90
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>If that's the decision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know whether it will have that.</v>

91
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we don't.</v>

92
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:36.160
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a material to a large</v>
<v Speaker 1>extent.</v>

93
00:05:36.161 --> 00:05:41.161
<v Speaker 1>We will come out of this and grow again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's only a temporary situation.</v>

94
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Now I've saved this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if we have this,</v>

95
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the engines of growth in the rest of the</v>

96
00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:53.161
<v Speaker 1>world are powerful enough that I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>think this will trigger will recession</v>

97
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.010
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.890
<v Speaker 1>there was Korean economies are just</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievable and uh,</v>

100
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.290
<v Speaker 1>if China grows at 10 percent a year or</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine percent a year,</v>

101
00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>if just started grant six percent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

102
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is still a lot of growth.</v>

103
00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 1>so I don't see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see that as a problem at all.</v>

105
00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:27.600
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>the purchasing power of Americans is</v>

106
00:06:27.801 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>decreasing and will continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease.</v>

107
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>I think this is inevitable as a result</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this global trend.</v>

108
00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

109
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 1>so some of the other countries are</v>
<v Speaker 1>raising to that level,</v>

110
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 1>coming to that level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

111
00:06:46.461 --> 00:06:49.880
<v Speaker 1>as I said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bigger problem is the income</v>

112
00:06:49.881 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>disparity between Africa and the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

113
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.390
<v Speaker 1>I think this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

114
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>this property did a more serious issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>on that particular question that in my</v>

115
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:02.481
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have.</v>

116
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:04.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
