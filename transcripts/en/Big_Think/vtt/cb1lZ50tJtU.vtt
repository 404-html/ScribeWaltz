1
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Well I think you can really trace it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to at least the 1960s,</v>

2
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>if not earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we started to see going on in</v>

3
00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>American politics in the 1960s and</v>
<v Speaker 1>continuing into the seventies and</v>

4
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>eighties was really the disintegration</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the old new deal coalition,</v>

5
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alignment that had been,</v>

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of put together by Franklin</v>

7
00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt and that sustained the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party as the dominant party</v>

8
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>in American politics for many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>that coalition consisted of a number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

10
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as white southerners,</v>

11
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>a northern white ethnic voters and white</v>
<v Speaker 1>working class voters,</v>

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inherently had a little in common with</v>

14
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly when you add in,</v>

15
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the growing representation of African</v>

16
00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>American voters after the 1960s with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>voting rights act.</v>

17
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this coalition was sort of inherently</v>

18
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:06.210
<v Speaker 1>unstable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what we began to see in the 1960s,</v>

19
00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:09.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially after the passage of the</v>

20
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.240
<v Speaker 1>voting rights act and the growth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>African American electorate was that,</v>

21
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more conservative elements in that</v>

22
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly white southerners,</v>

23
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>but also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>conservative white ethnic voters began</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move,</v>

25
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the Republicans.</v>

26
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had an ideological realignment that</v>

27
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.550
<v Speaker 1>began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't happen overnight.</v>

28
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.540
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not something that occurred in a</v>

29
00:01:36.541 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 1>single election or a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

30
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:41.190
<v Speaker 1>It was something that took place over</v>
<v Speaker 1>several decades actually.</v>

31
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we gradually began to see these more</v>

32
00:01:45.151 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>conservative voters moving away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and into the Republican camp.</v>

33
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on the other hand,</v>

34
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 1>in response to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.900
<v Speaker 1>more moderate to liberal voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>who had been aligned with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

37
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:02.670
<v Speaker 1>especially in parts of the country where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a moderate to liberal</v>

38
00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>republicans like the northeast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

39
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.200
<v Speaker 1>they began to move away from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans and toward the Democrats as</v>

40
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.450
<v Speaker 1>the Republican party became increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

41
00:02:12.451 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So you can see this beginning with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon's southern strategy,</v>

42
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.150
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1972,</v>

43
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and continuing with Ronald Reagan's</v>

44
00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>presidential campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then certainly in the 1990s with,</v>

45
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.330
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

46
00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>takeover of the Republican Party in</v>

47
00:02:30.541 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Congress by a more conservative group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders led by Newt Gingrich.</v>

48
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>So essentially what was happening here</v>
<v Speaker 1>was that,</v>

49
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the elite level,</v>

50
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>we were seeing increasing ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization and that change began to,</v>

51
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>affect the loyalties of the voters,</v>

52
00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.070
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and increasingly over time.</v>

53
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 1>And by the time we got to the 1990s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:02:56.791 --> 00:02:59.970
<v Speaker 1>it had reached the point where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

55
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.550
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.460
<v Speaker 1>old democratic coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and the Democratic dominance of at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress was no longer no longer</v>

58
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>existed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

59
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's really continued even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

60
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.310
<v Speaker 1>up to the present time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.600
<v Speaker 1>now something else that's been happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>a over this entire time period,</v>

62
00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>and especially with the last couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

63
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.900
<v Speaker 1>it's also playing into this has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.950
<v Speaker 1>the demographic changes taking place in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electorate and the growing diversity</v>

65
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.490
<v Speaker 1>of the American Electric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

66
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:39.710
<v Speaker 1>were nonwhite voters are becoming a</v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger share of the</v>

67
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>electorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

68
00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>and particularly of the Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coalition,</v>

69
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:49.171
<v Speaker 1>so that by 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the contributions of</v>

70
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 1>different racial and ethnic groups to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

71
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>party coalitions,</v>

72
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>you see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>nonwhites made up over 40% of democratic</v>
<v Speaker 1>voters.</v>

74
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas,</v>

75
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non whites were only about seven or 8%</v>

76
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>of Republican voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>so this is growing divergence between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties,</v>

78
00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 1>both in terms of their racial and</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic,</v>

79
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups that support the parties.</v>

80
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:22.570
<v Speaker 1>And also in terms of ideology and</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>

81
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.690
<v Speaker 1>it's the more engaged segment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public that really becomes increasingly</v>

82
00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:36.691
<v Speaker 1>polarized because they're the ones who</v>
<v Speaker 1>are really following these debates,</v>

83
00:04:36.911 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>who are really attentive to what is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in the congress to the</v>

84
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 1>positions of the parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they tend to react,</v>

85
00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:47.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more quickly than people who are</v>

86
00:04:47.651 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

87
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>not paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens over time is that even</v>

88
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:55.900
<v Speaker 1>though this process of realignment</v>
<v Speaker 1>really was,</v>

89
00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.720
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>initiated by political elites,</v>

90
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for strategic reasons.</v>

91
00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So you had Republican politicians in</v>
<v Speaker 1>particular who I think saw opportunities</v>

92
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:09.910
<v Speaker 1>to win over some of these voting groups</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had been traditionally supporting</v>

93
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.750
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats.</v>

94
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once the public,</v>

95
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>or at least the attentive segment of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>public becomes polarized,</v>

96
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that in turn sort of starts to constrain</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positions of political elites</v>

97
00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:24.180
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

98
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>and now they have to reflect the views</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the voters who make up their,</v>

99
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own base.</v>

100
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 1>And so what we're seeing today is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gotten to the point where the party</v>

101
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:42.541
<v Speaker 1>leaders and candidates for office are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really kind of constrained to a large</v>

102
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.551
<v Speaker 1>degree by the polarization that exists</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the attentive public.</v>

103
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

104
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:50.170
<v Speaker 1>at primary voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you find that,</v>

105
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican primary voters are really</v>

106
00:05:53.051 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 1>quite conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By and large Democratic primary voters</v>

107
00:05:55.811 --> 00:06:00.811
<v Speaker 1>tend to be a fairly liberal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore candidates who want to be</v>

108
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 1>successful in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to appeal to these primary</v>

109
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

110
00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more and more congressional</v>

111
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:17.531
<v Speaker 1>districts and even states where one</v>
<v Speaker 1>party is dominant and therefore the key</v>

112
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:23.441
<v Speaker 1>to success in those types of districts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those types of states is again,</v>

113
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 1>just to appeal to the party base and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's less need to worry about</v>

114
00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>appealing to voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 1>from the other party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So political campaigns have become more</v>

116
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:39.221
<v Speaker 1>about mobilizing the base then about</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to the swing voters in the</v>

117
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:41.924
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

118
00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.150
<v Speaker 1>If you look back over the course of</v>
<v Speaker 1>American history,</v>

119
00:06:48.151 --> 00:06:50.340
<v Speaker 1>we've been through many periods of</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>

120
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent.</v>

121
00:06:51.721 --> 00:06:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

122
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>the period from the 1950s do the 1960s</v>
<v Speaker 1>was unusual in that a degree of partisan</v>

123
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:04.410
<v Speaker 1>polarization was much less than normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 1>but if you go back and look at American</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics in the 19th century,</v>

125
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in much of the early 20th century,</v>

126
00:07:11.011 --> 00:07:13.140
<v Speaker 1>you find that in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

127
00:07:13.141 --> 00:07:17.760
<v Speaker 1>they were very sharp differences between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties and very intense conflict</v>

128
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and very overheated rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

129
00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.450
<v Speaker 1>and really nasty personal attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

130
00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:29.451
<v Speaker 1>on even some of the leaders that we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to think of as among our greatest,</v>

131
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.881
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>

132
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:37.800
<v Speaker 1>people like Thomas Jefferson and Abraham</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lincoln were viciously attacked.</v>

133
00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

134
00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Franklin Roosevelt certainly was as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

135
00:07:40.921 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

136
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.880
<v Speaker 1>in a way this is just sort of normal</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

137
00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:49.940
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to go back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they didn't have the internet</v>

138
00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:55.740
<v Speaker 1>or cable news or talk radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what they had were pamphlets and a</v>

139
00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.880
<v Speaker 1>party newspapers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

140
00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you go back and look at some of those</v>

141
00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:00.850
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

142
00:08:00.851 --> 00:08:01.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

143
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the attacks were very personal,</v>

144
00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>very nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

145
00:08:07.061 --> 00:08:11.590
<v Speaker 1>I mean much worse than anything we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>seen in recent election campaigns.</v>

146
00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:19.491
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely.</v>

147
00:08:19.491 --> 00:08:21.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the changes that have</v>

148
00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>occurred in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

149
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.403
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>in the media have a reinforced this</v>
<v Speaker 1>trend toward polarization,</v>

151
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.170
<v Speaker 1>particularly the proliferation of news</v>
<v Speaker 1>outlets,</v>

152
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cable news talk radio and the Internet,</v>

153
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 1>which mean that now people have many</v>
<v Speaker 1>more choices about where to get their</v>

154
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:47.951
<v Speaker 1>political information and they can turn</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a news outlets and information</v>

155
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>sources that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in consistent,</v>

157
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:55.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or reflect their own,</v>

158
00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their own political orientation.</v>

159
00:08:57.151 --> 00:08:59.280
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're liberal or Conservative,</v>

160
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you can find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

161
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>media outlets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go to Fox News.</v>

162
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>If you're a conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go to MSNBC.</v>

163
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

164
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

165
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:12.900
<v Speaker 1>people no longer rely on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:09:12.901 --> 00:09:16.470
<v Speaker 1>a few major network news broadcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

167
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>to get their information the way they</v>
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>

168
00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 or 50 years ago.</v>

169
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem there is not so much</v>

170
00:09:28.921 --> 00:09:32.970
<v Speaker 1>with polarization as it is with certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions and rules that have</v>

171
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:36.270
<v Speaker 1>survived from an earlier era when</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics was not so polarized.</v>

172
00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prime example of that being the</v>

173
00:09:39.271 --> 00:09:41.430
<v Speaker 1>filibuster in the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

174
00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.760
<v Speaker 1>because in the past when there's less</v>
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>

175
00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:51.110
<v Speaker 1>the filibuster was used very sparingly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As the parties have become increasingly</v>

176
00:09:53.281 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>polarized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen that filibusters have become</v>

177
00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.360
<v Speaker 1>routine and almost everything gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>filibustered because it is,</v>

178
00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way that the minority party can</v>

179
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.270
<v Speaker 1>exert any influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

180
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 1>so I think it is that filibuster role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fact that it takes only 41 senators</v>

181
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:23.280
<v Speaker 1>to effectively block,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:28.281
<v Speaker 1>any action on the part of the majority</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is largely responsible for this</v>

183
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:30.470
<v Speaker 1>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

184
00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:30.901
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

185
00:10:30.901 --> 00:10:31.734
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

186
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.911
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

187
00:10:32.911 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>of gridlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This feeling that,</v>

188
00:10:34.591 --> 00:10:38.400
<v Speaker 1>that we've been gridlock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is that this congress is</v>

189
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 1>actually passed a lot of major</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>

190
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>Some of it's been quite controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

191
00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really the case that it's been</v>

192
00:10:44.761 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 1>an unproductive congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just been involved in dealing with</v>

193
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:51.240
<v Speaker 1>some very controversial issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

194
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.400
<v Speaker 1>and on the house side where majority</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule really prevails,</v>

195
00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great deal of legislation has been</v>

196
00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 1>passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of it has then gotten bogged down</v>

197
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:03.160
<v Speaker 1>in the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

198
00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

199
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.840
<v Speaker 1>it's still awaiting action again because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the filibuster rule primarily.</v>

200
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

201
00:11:18.601 --> 00:11:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to say that,</v>

202
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a certain degree of polarization</v>

203
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:25.930
<v Speaker 1>that democracy really depends upon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

204
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:27.620
<v Speaker 1>having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

205
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.330
<v Speaker 1>a certain degree of polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.360
<v Speaker 1>so that voters can choose between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>parties based on which set of policies</v>

207
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.280
<v Speaker 1>you really support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think today it's pretty clear.</v>

208
00:11:41.281 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 1>I think what the parties stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People for the most part,</v>

209
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I think understand the differences</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the democratic and Republican</v>

210
00:11:47.941 --> 00:11:49.070
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

211
00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.260
<v Speaker 1>and they feel that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

212
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:57.560
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot at stake in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections and therefore that tends to,</v>

213
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase the level of interest.</v>

214
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Certainly polarization can go too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

215
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:05.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

216
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.890
<v Speaker 1>in a democratic political system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important that those who,</v>

217
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are defeated,</v>

218
00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:16.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to recognize and accept the</v>

219
00:12:16.841 --> 00:12:21.430
<v Speaker 1>legitimacy of the winners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the winners have to,</v>

220
00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that,</v>

221
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who lost the last election may be</v>

222
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.800
<v Speaker 1>back in power in the future.</v>

223
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what we're seeing now in American</v>

224
00:12:32.861 --> 00:12:37.330
<v Speaker 1>politics is that sometimes the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rhetoric I think gets so heated,</v>

225
00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:39.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

226
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

227
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:46.410
<v Speaker 1>there's a tendency to sometimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>questioned the legitimacy of the other</v>

228
00:12:47.021 --> 00:12:48.640
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

229
00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:53.850
<v Speaker 1>and we've seen this a on both sides that</v>
<v Speaker 1>both among Democrats and Republicans as</v>

230
00:12:54.581 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 1>a tendency to question the legitimacy of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

231
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the other party.</v>

232
00:12:58.361 --> 00:13:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And the other side to question the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

233
00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.380
<v Speaker 1>the loyalty of the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the patriotism of the other side.</v>

234
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:09.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

236
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of inflamed rhetoric can</v>

237
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.340
<v Speaker 1>sometimes also lead to threats of</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

238
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:18.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that is a very unfortunate.</v>

239
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think while having a clear</v>

240
00:13:25.031 --> 00:13:27.100
<v Speaker 1>differences between the parties is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>

241
00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that some of the overheated</v>

242
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:31.990
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

243
00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:36.160
<v Speaker 1>and personal animosity that we've seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>

244
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really not a desirable,</v>

245
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:47.550
<v Speaker 1>well I don't think it's polarization is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to end anytime soon.</v>

246
00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there are some very</v>

247
00:13:50.491 --> 00:13:53.370
<v Speaker 1>important longterm factors underlying</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

248
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.840
<v Speaker 1>One of which is the growing in a racial</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ethnic diversity of the,</v>

249
00:13:57.841 --> 00:13:58.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electorate,</v>

250
00:13:58.741 --> 00:14:01.140
<v Speaker 1>which is only going to increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

251
00:14:01.141 --> 00:14:06.141
<v Speaker 1>and so as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial and ethnic composition of the</v>

252
00:14:06.181 --> 00:14:09.900
<v Speaker 1>party coalitions continues to divert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

253
00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is kind of reinforcing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trend toward polarization.</v>

254
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.240
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing that on the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration for example,</v>

255
00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:21.060
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

256
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

257
00:14:22.981 --> 00:14:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

258
00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:29.190
<v Speaker 1>there are some Republican party leaders</v>
<v Speaker 1>and strategists who realized that that</v>

259
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.370
<v Speaker 1>the party really needs to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to reach out to this rapidly growing</v>

260
00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>voting block of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

261
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.140
<v Speaker 1>Latinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.540
<v Speaker 1>who are now the largest ethnic group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

263
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.700
<v Speaker 1>largest minority in the country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>within a few years will be the largest</v>

264
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.060
<v Speaker 1>minority in the electorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

265
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:53.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll continue to make up a growing</v>

266
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:55.310
<v Speaker 1>share of the population.</v>

267
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:57.460
<v Speaker 1>And the electrode over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

268
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.710
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a great deal of pressure from</v>

269
00:15:00.711 --> 00:15:05.711
<v Speaker 1>the conservative Republican base to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hard line stance on issues like</v>

270
00:15:05.841 --> 00:15:07.820
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

271
00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>so I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

272
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.880
<v Speaker 1>demographic trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

273
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.940
<v Speaker 1>are contributing to this polarization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think rising education levels are</v>

274
00:15:16.941 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>contributing to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a better educated electorate,</v>

275
00:15:20.061 --> 00:15:25.061
<v Speaker 1>which also means a larger percentage of</v>
<v Speaker 1>voters who tend to think about politics</v>

276
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:29.400
<v Speaker 1>in ideological terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

277
00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:32.480
<v Speaker 1>who can understand these ideological</v>
<v Speaker 1>debates.</v>

278
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.423
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

279
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.730
<v Speaker 1>so all that I think is suggest that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a,</v>

280
00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.280
<v Speaker 1>this is likely to continue for some</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

281
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now eventually,</v>

282
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.920
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we may see the leaders of one party or</v>

283
00:15:45.921 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 1>the other decide that it is in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest to try to move back toward the</v>

284
00:15:50.631 --> 00:15:52.700
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

285
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:57.260
<v Speaker 1>particularly if that party feels that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the only way to survive.</v>

286
00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw that recently in,</v>

287
00:16:00.581 --> 00:16:02.360
<v Speaker 1>in Britain where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

288
00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:06.620
<v Speaker 1>the Conservative Party after being out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the wilderness for 13 years,</v>

289
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found a new leader who decided that it</v>

290
00:16:12.261 --> 00:16:14.930
<v Speaker 1>was necessary to moderate the parties</v>
<v Speaker 1>image.</v>

291
00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that could happen at some point,</v>

292
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's difficult in our system because</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our system,</v>

293
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 1>unlike Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

294
00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:28.780
<v Speaker 1>the voters themselves plays such a key</v>
<v Speaker 1>role in selecting the leaders of the</v>

295
00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:32.900
<v Speaker 1>party through the primary elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have,</v>

296
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something analogous to that in Britain</v>

297
00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:37.850
<v Speaker 1>or in most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most other countries.</v>

298
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so leaders aren't necessarily free here</v>

299
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.610
<v Speaker 1>to just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

300
00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:46.820
<v Speaker 1>adopt new positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

301
00:16:46.821 --> 00:16:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Willy Nilly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

302
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:50.690
<v Speaker 1>they have to worry about how the voters</v>
<v Speaker 1>who make up their base,</v>

303
00:16:50.691 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 1>they're going to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think that God is going to act as</v>

304
00:16:53.631 --> 00:16:56.720
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a pretty strong break on any tendency</v>

305
00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.920
<v Speaker 1>toward a moderation in the foreseeable</v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

306
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it may lead to some changes in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger political system,</v>

307
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:16.720
<v Speaker 1>particularly in some of the rules and</v>
<v Speaker 1>procedures in the Congress and</v>

308
00:17:16.881 --> 00:17:20.840
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most likely source of change are</v>

309
00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:23.600
<v Speaker 1>place where I think we're likely to see</v>
<v Speaker 1>change will be there.</v>

310
00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Because I see the Senate right now as</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a particularly an obstacle,</v>

311
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

312
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:32.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.970
<v Speaker 1>to majority rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

314
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
<v Speaker 1>both because of the filibuster but also</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the basis of representation</v>

315
00:17:40.281 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 1>there that every state has two senators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that,</v>

316
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:49.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>states with a 500,000 people like</v>

317
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming have two senators and states</v>
<v Speaker 1>with 37 million people like California</v>

318
00:17:52.951 --> 00:17:54.780
<v Speaker 1>has two senators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

319
00:17:55.950 --> 00:18:00.950
<v Speaker 1>the 20 least populous states have less</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in them than California alone.</v>

320
00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.240
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

321
00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:08.820
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

322
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.430
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

323
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprises a lot of people,</v>

324
00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:16.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're sort of aware that,</v>

325
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>states have different populations,</v>

326
00:18:18.811 --> 00:18:21.090
<v Speaker 1>but that divergence just keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing,</v>

327
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

328
00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think there's going to be some</v>

329
00:18:24.241 --> 00:18:26.050
<v Speaker 1>pressure there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

330
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:28.080
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

331
00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.080
<v Speaker 1>at least reform some of the rules of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Senate,</v>

332
00:18:31.081 --> 00:18:36.081
<v Speaker 1>like the filibuster rule to make it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least somewhat easier for the majority</v>

333
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:40.890
<v Speaker 1>to govern because right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

334
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.650
<v Speaker 1>because of the filibuster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you need a superman,</v>

335
00:18:43.651 --> 00:18:47.850
<v Speaker 1>especially after the midterm elections</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the number of Democrats in the</v>

336
00:18:47.851 --> 00:18:49.530
<v Speaker 1>Senate is almost certain to be reduced.</v>

337
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to go back to having a</v>

338
00:18:51.871 --> 00:18:54.210
<v Speaker 1>much smaller majority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

339
00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:59.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the likelihood of getting 60 votes to</v>

340
00:18:59.701 --> 00:19:02.930
<v Speaker 1>pass anything is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

341
00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:03.803
<v Speaker 1>almost no.</v>

342
00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:11.341
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

343
00:19:11.341 --> 00:19:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you hear about a ever to hear you hear a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric along those lines quite</v>

344
00:19:16.171 --> 00:19:17.820
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When,</v>

345
00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:20.700
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Obama was,</v>

346
00:19:20.701 --> 00:19:21.990
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

347
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.390
<v Speaker 1>his first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

348
00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.020
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

349
00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:28.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough,</v>

350
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was the speech that he gave at the,</v>

351
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the 2004 Democratic National</v>

352
00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Convention where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:39.320
<v Speaker 1>he talked about there being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

354
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:40.700
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

355
00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:44.340
<v Speaker 1>red,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no there in a red states of</v>

356
00:19:44.341 --> 00:19:47.310
<v Speaker 1>American blue states of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one United States of America.</v>

357
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:48.541
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

358
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 1>he used some similar rhetoric during the</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 presidential campaign.</v>

359
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.070
<v Speaker 1>And John Mccain also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:58.050
<v Speaker 1>talked about wanting to heal these rifts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

361
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>appealing to those on the other side.</v>

362
00:20:02.011 --> 00:20:02.580
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:04.620
<v Speaker 1>as the campaign went on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we saw that,</v>

364
00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually the,</v>

365
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

366
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.840
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positions of the candidates became</v>

367
00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:11.920
<v Speaker 1>increasingly polarized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

368
00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 1>and by the end there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

369
00:20:13.441 --> 00:20:18.360
<v Speaker 1>there was very little of that sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>effort to reach across the,</v>

370
00:20:18.361 --> 00:20:19.560
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other side.</v>

371
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the fact is that,</v>

372
00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:25.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electrode itself is very polarized.</v>

373
00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.870
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

374
00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.600
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

375
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very high degree of,</v>

376
00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:34.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

377
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.550
<v Speaker 1>partisanship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

378
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.840
<v Speaker 1>and when it comes to voting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tend to vote along party lines.</v>

379
00:20:39.841 --> 00:20:42.390
<v Speaker 1>There's not much crossover voting these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

380
00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so as the campaign proceeds,</v>

381
00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:50.080
<v Speaker 1>they focus tends to become increasingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>on energizing and mobilizing your own</v>

382
00:20:50.081 --> 00:20:52.470
<v Speaker 1>base.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

383
00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:53.520
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

384
00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.520
<v Speaker 1>because there's such a small sliver of</v>
<v Speaker 1>undecided voters left,</v>

385
00:20:58.920 --> 00:20:59.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

386
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.880
<v Speaker 1>in the middle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually very hard to act even</v>

387
00:21:02.881 --> 00:21:04.220
<v Speaker 1>reached those people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

388
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.500
<v Speaker 1>because they tend to actually be the</v>
<v Speaker 1>least least interested in at least</v>

389
00:21:07.501 --> 00:21:09.810
<v Speaker 1>attentive segment of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the public.</v>

390
00:21:09.811 --> 00:21:11.190
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since the election,</v>

391
00:21:11.191 --> 00:21:13.740
<v Speaker 1>certainly we've seen more of that sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of back and forth,</v>

392
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

393
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't we have more bipartisanship</v>

394
00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.380
<v Speaker 1>and each side blaming the other for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

395
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:24.060
<v Speaker 1>the lack of bipartisanship.</v>

396
00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.940
<v Speaker 1>But fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very difficult to have any</v>

397
00:21:26.941 --> 00:21:30.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of bipartisan cooperation these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days because the differences between the</v>

398
00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.790
<v Speaker 1>parties are so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

399
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.930
<v Speaker 1>there used to be a lot of members of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress in the middle.</v>

400
00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.810
<v Speaker 1>You had moderate to conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats,</v>

401
00:21:39.811 --> 00:21:43.260
<v Speaker 1>you had moderate to liberal Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of overlap there.</v>

402
00:21:43.261 --> 00:21:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And therefore it was easy to find</v>
<v Speaker 1>coalition partners from the other party.</v>

403
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Now there's no overlap at all between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parties.</v>

404
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:55.650
<v Speaker 1>And so to build a bipartisan coalition</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very difficult because you have to,</v>

405
00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.350
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you tried to reach across the,</v>

406
00:21:58.351 --> 00:22:00.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the partisan divide,</v>

407
00:22:00.271 --> 00:22:01.710
<v Speaker 1>that divide is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very wide.</v>

408
00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it means that,</v>

409
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:08.960
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to bring in any significant number of</v>

410
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:16.120
<v Speaker 1>members from the other party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to actually compromise your</v>

411
00:22:16.221 --> 00:22:18.190
<v Speaker 1>fundamental principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

412
00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's why I think we're seeing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just doesn't happen.</v>

413
00:22:20.361 --> 00:22:22.220
<v Speaker 1>There are a handful of members in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle.</v>

414
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

415
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:26.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see some efforts to reach out to</v>

416
00:22:26.901 --> 00:22:31.901
<v Speaker 1>those few members as we saw in the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>days of the Obama administration when</v>

417
00:22:33.021 --> 00:22:37.700
<v Speaker 1>they were able to win over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had three Republican senators who</v>

418
00:22:37.701 --> 00:22:41.240
<v Speaker 1>voted for the stimulus bill and one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them subsequently switched parties.</v>

419
00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this person does exist,</v>

420
00:22:47.991 --> 00:22:51.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's really confined primarily to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposition party,</v>

421
00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.690
<v Speaker 1>to the supporters of the opposition</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

422
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we saw the same thing really,</v>

423
00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Bush administration,</v>

424
00:22:58.970 --> 00:23:01.640
<v Speaker 1>particularly the last two years of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration.</v>

425
00:23:01.940 --> 00:23:04.190
<v Speaker 1>There were a lot of angry voters out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

426
00:23:04.191 --> 00:23:05.420
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time they were,</v>

427
00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:10.220
<v Speaker 1>they were almost all democrats who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>upset about things like the war in Iraq,</v>

428
00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:11.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

429
00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bush administration's,</v>

430
00:23:13.401 --> 00:23:15.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and environmental policies and</v>

431
00:23:15.441 --> 00:23:18.740
<v Speaker 1>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with a Democratic president and</v>

432
00:23:18.741 --> 00:23:21.080
<v Speaker 1>Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the Republicans,</v>

433
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:23.990
<v Speaker 1>especially the more engaged Republicans</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are angry,</v>

434
00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.630
<v Speaker 1>they are angry because they disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

435
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:30.680
<v Speaker 1>with the Democrats on issues like</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>

436
00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and budgetary priorities and so on.</v>

437
00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:35.841
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

438
00:23:35.841 --> 00:23:37.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there are angry voters out</v>

439
00:23:37.791 --> 00:23:39.140
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think sometimes it gets a little</v>

440
00:23:39.141 --> 00:23:40.730
<v Speaker 1>overblown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

441
00:23:40.731 --> 00:23:45.731
<v Speaker 1>because I'm not sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>voters are angry or overall now than</v>

442
00:23:47.421 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>they have been in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

443
00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:53.330
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just that we're seeing more</v>
<v Speaker 1>visible manifestations of that with</v>

444
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 1>these tea party demonstrations.</v>

445
00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not angry anymore because now,</v>

446
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:02.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

447
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.190
<v Speaker 1>because you have a democratic president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

448
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:06.670
<v Speaker 1>now the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

449
00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.240
<v Speaker 1>some of them might still not be thrilled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all of the things the Obama</v>

450
00:24:11.241 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 1>administration has done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by and large,</v>

451
00:24:14.121 --> 00:24:16.250
<v Speaker 1>I think what you find is that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a reversal,</v>

452
00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:17.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

453
00:24:17.391 --> 00:24:18.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

454
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.770
<v Speaker 1>sort of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anger is gone over from one side to</v>

455
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:26.771
<v Speaker 1>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Right now,</v>

456
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because again,</v>

457
00:24:29.781 --> 00:24:33.560
<v Speaker 1>it's harder I think for people to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked up when,</v>

458
00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the majority,</v>

459
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that especially in midterm elections,</v>

460
00:24:38.031 --> 00:24:41.810
<v Speaker 1>we tend to see that it's the disgruntled</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are the most active.</v>

461
00:24:42.170 --> 00:24:47.170
<v Speaker 1>We saw that in 2006 where it was really</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democrats by and large,</v>

462
00:24:48.201 --> 00:24:51.080
<v Speaker 1>who are the most enthusiastic at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most engaged.</v>

463
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's the Republicans,</v>

464
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:55.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a Democrat in the White House.</v>

465
00:24:55.941 --> 00:24:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's sort of part of the normal</v>

466
00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:02.000
<v Speaker 1>cycle of American politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what tends to happen in these,</v>

467
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:04.730
<v Speaker 1>in these midterm elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that with increasing</v>

468
00:25:04.731 --> 00:25:06.140
<v Speaker 1>polarization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

469
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.320
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens now is that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>swings become greater,</v>

470
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.760
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reaction becomes even stronger.</v>

471
00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think certainly a,</v>

472
00:25:22.731 --> 00:25:24.530
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some incumbents are in danger,</v>

473
00:25:24.531 --> 00:25:27.620
<v Speaker 1>although I think that some of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

474
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:29.720
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

475
00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.570
<v Speaker 1>characterization of the election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

476
00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:36.110
<v Speaker 1>as an anti incumbent wave has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>overblown.</v>

477
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that in all of these primary</v>

478
00:25:39.861 --> 00:25:42.740
<v Speaker 1>elections so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only one house incumbent has actually</v>

479
00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>been defeated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

480
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and two Senate incumbents.</v>

481
00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.150
<v Speaker 1>But in both of those cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there were actually special</v>

482
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.070
<v Speaker 1>reasons behind their losses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

483
00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:57.071
<v Speaker 1>Arlen Specter switched parties about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>year before the election and really gave</v>

484
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Democrats very little reason to vote for</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

485
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:05.690
<v Speaker 1>Here's a guy who had been a republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of his career Democrats in</v>

486
00:26:05.691 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're used to voting against him.</v>

487
00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he switched parties and basically the</v>

488
00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 1>rationale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he gives us that,</v>

489
00:26:12.591 --> 00:26:14.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I needed to do this to survive.</v>

490
00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

491
00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there that it had more to do</v>

492
00:26:18.981 --> 00:26:19.814
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

493
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.230
<v Speaker 1>the particular circumstances of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>party switching by Arlen Specter.</v>

494
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

495
00:26:26.091 --> 00:26:27.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

496
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

497
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.121
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

498
00:26:30.121 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>the Utah case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

499
00:26:31.281 --> 00:26:32.240
<v Speaker 1>you had a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

500
00:26:32.241 --> 00:26:35.030
<v Speaker 1>not a primary election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a very small,</v>

501
00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.143
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

502
00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.210
<v Speaker 1>party convention dominated by the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative activists in the Republican</v>

503
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Party in Utah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a pretty conservative state to</v>

504
00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:46.230
<v Speaker 1>begin with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just wouldn't want to read too much</v>

505
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.390
<v Speaker 1>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

506
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.240
<v Speaker 1>now there's no question when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

507
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:55.590
<v Speaker 1>voters are discontented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

508
00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.620
<v Speaker 1>over the economy and the state of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that they tend to vote against</v>

509
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:05.550
<v Speaker 1>the party in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

510
00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.900
<v Speaker 1>and in addition to the fact that it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>midterm election and the president's</v>

511
00:27:09.901 --> 00:27:11.490
<v Speaker 1>party almost always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

512
00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 1>loses seats in midterm elections and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats are in a rather defensive</v>

513
00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:22.080
<v Speaker 1>posture anyway because they've picked up</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many seats in the last two elections,</v>

514
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 1>many of which are actually in Republican</v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

515
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you've got a lot of,</v>

516
00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic incumbents running this year</v>

517
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.450
<v Speaker 1>who are representing states and</v>
<v Speaker 1>districts that,</v>

518
00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

519
00:27:34.381 --> 00:27:36.660
<v Speaker 1>have usually voted Republican in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

520
00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.710
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my expectation is that the Democrats</v>

521
00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:43.530
<v Speaker 1>will lose a substantial number of seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

522
00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.640
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

523
00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 1>quite a few democratic incumbents will</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose,</v>

524
00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:52.431
<v Speaker 1>but that's more a reflection of just the</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal kind of partisan swings that we</v>

525
00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:56.340
<v Speaker 1>see in elections and especially in</v>
<v Speaker 1>midterm elections rather than any</v>

526
00:27:56.790 --> 00:28:00.630
<v Speaker 1>unusual level of voter anger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Moreover,</v>

527
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.000
<v Speaker 1>I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

528
00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.770
<v Speaker 1>misleading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think to try to read too much into the</v>

529
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:12.090
<v Speaker 1>results of these primary elections or</v>
<v Speaker 1>special elections that have been taking</v>

530
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:12.924
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

531
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:15.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that is a tendency on the part</v>

532
00:28:15.121 --> 00:28:18.380
<v Speaker 1>of the media often to over-interpret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

533
00:28:18.390 --> 00:28:20.700
<v Speaker 1>the latest event,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

534
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.910
<v Speaker 1>whatever just happened is always the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important thing that's ever</v>

535
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:26.190
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw this during the presidential</v>

536
00:28:26.191 --> 00:28:26.851
<v Speaker 1>campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

537
00:28:26.851 --> 00:28:29.550
<v Speaker 1>both the primaries and the general</v>
<v Speaker 1>election campaign.</v>

538
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reverend Wright,</v>

539
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was when that,</v>

540
00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:35.850
<v Speaker 1>when that event happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that was the end of Obama's</v>

541
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 1>candidacy.</v>

542
00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:37.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

543
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

544
00:28:38.431 --> 00:28:40.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the general election campaign,</v>

545
00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the furor over surrounding the,</v>

546
00:28:42.691 --> 00:28:45.210
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choice of Sarah Palin as John Mccain's</v>

547
00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:46.170
<v Speaker 1>running mate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

548
00:28:46.171 --> 00:28:48.210
<v Speaker 1>that turned out to be overblown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

549
00:28:48.211 --> 00:28:50.490
<v Speaker 1>so I think we're seeing the same thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

550
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:53.490
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time some new interesting event</v>

551
00:28:53.491 --> 00:28:55.710
<v Speaker 1>takes place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an encumbent losing in a</v>

552
00:28:55.711 --> 00:28:56.930
<v Speaker 1>primary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

553
00:28:56.931 --> 00:29:00.700
<v Speaker 1>or a special election outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The media jump on that and,</v>

554
00:29:00.701 --> 00:29:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and try to read,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

555
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:06.450
<v Speaker 1>into that some great significance for</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen in November.</v>

556
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that is a really overblown.</v>
