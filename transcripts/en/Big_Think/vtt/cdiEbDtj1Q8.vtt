1
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to have something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's beneath the surface.</v>

2
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're writing essentially</v>

3
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 2>an elaborate diary entry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

4
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 2>I think profundity is in the eye of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>beholder.</v>

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of my,</v>

6
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 2>some of the essays I get that were</v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminated from the collection,</v>

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 2>there were a couple of them that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided not to include because they</v>

8
00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 2>didn't have enough and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any universal application,</v>

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was me,</v>

10
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 2>I got a parking ticket or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some boy was mean to me and no one,</v>

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 2>particularly carers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

12
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.590
<v Speaker 2>you can make people care about small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>significant details and sort of lend the</v>

13
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 2>entire universe to a tiny detail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

14
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 2>there's this sort of like themed and</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddhist Meditation Practice where</v>

15
00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to picture the entire</v>
<v Speaker 2>world on the head of a pin,</v>

16
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I feel like the only kind of</v>

17
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 2>meditation or stillness or non neuroses</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ever made any sense to me.</v>

18
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's sort of what the essays try</v>

19
00:01:05.851 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

20
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the critiques have been at,</v>

21
00:01:08.911 --> 00:01:11.940
<v Speaker 2>some of them don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that some of them read a little bit too</v>

22
00:01:11.941 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 2>casual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when you're writing personal</v>

23
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:14.761
<v Speaker 2>essays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

24
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:16.890
<v Speaker 2>it can be difficult to suss out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

25
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.820
<v Speaker 2>what seems profound to you because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily intellectually</v>

26
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 2>profound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of emotionally profound.</v>

27
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 2>So if you're just sort of coming through</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

28
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's what speaks to or,</v>

29
00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 2>or what,</v>

30
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.160
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

31
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>I've spent I guess about seven years</v>

32
00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 2>in total encouraging my author is not to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay too much attention to the critics.</v>

33
00:01:44.651 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 2>That all press is good press.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

34
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.990
<v Speaker 2>book publicity is very different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>any other kind of publicity.</v>

35
00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:52.620
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that I have friends who</v>
<v Speaker 2>work in music and film publicity and</v>

36
00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:56.050
<v Speaker 2>it's much more defensive whereas ours is</v>
<v Speaker 2>much more,</v>

37
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please God Mr. Short story writer,</v>

38
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>go commit a felony so I can get you some</v>
<v Speaker 2>press.</v>

39
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:02.470
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

40
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so just to be written about,</v>

41
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then is,</v>

42
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:08.710
<v Speaker 2>it is a feat in itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I guess you kind of worry about</v>

43
00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:10.870
<v Speaker 2>the tone second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

44
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 2>and I think I have luckily taken a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit of that to heart.</v>

45
00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the criticism hasn't been too harsh or I</v>

46
00:02:19.211 --> 00:02:21.370
<v Speaker 2>don't see it because they're personal</v>
<v Speaker 2>essays.</v>

47
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:26.371
<v Speaker 2>I think if I let it all in thoroughly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a critique of me as a human</v>

48
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>

49
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 2>So it's very easy to look at it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

50
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the book reviews have been</v>

51
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:35.860
<v Speaker 2>assigned to people who are slightly</v>
<v Speaker 2>younger or my age.</v>

52
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

53
00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:43.221
<v Speaker 2>I have been sort of more interested to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the reviews by reviewers who I know</v>

54
00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:47.950
<v Speaker 2>have been doing it for a while and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>really reviewing it as a book as opposed</v>

55
00:02:47.951 --> 00:02:52.951
<v Speaker 2>to a extended diary entry that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>could have written if only they had had</v>

56
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.070
<v Speaker 2>a couple of more red balls after work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

57
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.090
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy to slough off,</v>

58
00:02:58.091 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's important to some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

59
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and some of it's been really helpful.</v>

60
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I didn't expect that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I expected just to be worried about</v>

61
00:03:06.011 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 2>getting press and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hopefully getting the book out there</v>

62
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>and getting people aware of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

63
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>and some of the critiques have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually really useful.</v>

64
00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a pleasant surprise.</v>
