00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap that the celebrity feels is that</v>

2
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>the celebrity can reach millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like that.</v>

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that they land a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they need to Africa,</v>

4
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>it makes millions of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't even care about Africa.</v>

5
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:26.981
<v Speaker 1>Look towards what's going on in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

6
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

7
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a celebrity prep period during</v>

8
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:36.431
<v Speaker 1>any form of charity is a great thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a celebrity don't really have to</v>

9
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>do anything as much as you want to think</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

10
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:41.530
<v Speaker 1>They're celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they could actually just chill and</v>

11
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.910
<v Speaker 1>don't do nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>but then there's those celebrities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't own the land.</v>

13
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:49.940
<v Speaker 1>They name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they act on it.</v>

14
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the bar is rose so high</v>

15
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>for these celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like Angelina Jolie.</v>

16
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

17
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>she been to Haiti with me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brad Pitt.</v>

18
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look what Brad's doing at New Orleans.</v>

19
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real initiatives.</v>

20
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>George Clooney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like going to these places,</v>

21
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Speaker 1>looking with their eyes and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

22
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 1>and learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm bringing the information</v>

23
00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 1>back to the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where the future is</v>

24
00:01:19.221 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>headed.</v>

25
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.480
