1
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>I think the most important thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>then I have learned</v>

2
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more to learn</v>

3
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>that we should,</v>

4
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.563
<v Speaker 2>that we,</v>

5
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>that we should all be hungry for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lifetime.</v>

6
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

7
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.500
<v Speaker 1>at my next birthday I'll be 68 all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great scientific discoveries made by all</v>

8
00:00:41.811 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>the great geniuses were largely made</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they were in their twenties and</v>

9
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 1>thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet I became about two years ago,</v>

10
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>obsessed with particle physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was determined to understand it</v>

11
00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:06.071
<v Speaker 1>before I died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not have done that if I hadn't</v>

12
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:12.241
<v Speaker 1>learned to read when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I hadn't had the opportunity to study</v>

13
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:19.600
<v Speaker 1>science courses in my high school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I lived in the second poorest state</v>

14
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which most people my age and my state</v>

15
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:28.150
<v Speaker 1>did not have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I happened to go to a bigger high school</v>

16
00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>with people who</v>

17
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>understood we had to get good science</v>
<v Speaker 1>and math teachers there.</v>

18
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.430
<v Speaker 1>And if I hadn't gone to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my case,</v>

19
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Georgetown University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a jesuit university and I</v>

20
00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:46.911
<v Speaker 1>hadn't been subject to the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rigors that the jesuits impose,</v>

21
00:01:47.251 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>which made me realize that however much</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought I knew and how real smart I</v>

22
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know very much and I wasn't</v>

23
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:55.350
<v Speaker 1>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a lot to deliver.</v>

24
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>So that's the most important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned that your brain is a gift and</v>

25
00:02:00.871 --> 00:02:05.871
<v Speaker 1>we now know that people well into their</v>
<v Speaker 1>late sixties and seventies can form new</v>

26
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:11.091
<v Speaker 1>neural networks so that even though your</v>
<v Speaker 1>brain begins to shrink and your thirties</v>

27
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>and does throughout your life stance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of us ever use even close to half</v>

28
00:02:16.501 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>of our brainpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got a lot left and we will in our</v>

29
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.850
<v Speaker 1>light on our last day on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a lot left.</v>

30
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.990
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that we now know as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific measure because of all the</v>

31
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:35.511
<v Speaker 1>brain scanning technology that we can</v>
<v Speaker 1>form these networks and that we formed</v>

32
00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>them best were most likely to form new</v>
<v Speaker 1>neural networks later in life by</v>

33
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:45.861
<v Speaker 1>learning something new.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I said I was interested in</v>

34
00:02:46.381 --> 00:02:51.150
<v Speaker 1>particle physics and also in</v>
<v Speaker 1>astrophysics and I'm trying to figure</v>

35
00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:56.151
<v Speaker 1>out what it means that we've located 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>planets outside our solar system in the</v>

36
00:02:56.971 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to have enough density and be</v>

37
00:03:00.341 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>far enough away from their sons that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might be able to support life.</v>

38
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>That may be the answer to the Russia</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine problem and attack from out an</v>

39
00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 1>attack from outer space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll immediately unite us.</v>

40
00:03:12.071 --> 00:03:17.071
<v Speaker 1>All</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of Congress in the U s will</v>

41
00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>immediately start hugging each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>singing Kumbaya.</v>

42
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can form new neural networks doing</v>

43
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>that cause I don't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or I did and when I started,</v>

44
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.630
<v Speaker 1>a theoretical physicist would do better</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to Suzuki piano lessons with his</v>

45
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:43.141
<v Speaker 1>grandchild or her grandchild and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>playing if you knew nothing about music.</v>

46
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>But this is an incredible thing that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important thing I learned is that</v>

47
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.120
<v Speaker 1>it's important to keep on learning that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should stay hungry and that their</v>

48
00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>greatest gift can be even as your body</v>
<v Speaker 1>begins to fail.</v>

49
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>If your mind is still working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to use it</v>

50
00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.050
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
