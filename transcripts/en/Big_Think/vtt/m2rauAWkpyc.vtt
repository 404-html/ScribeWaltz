1
00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Star Wars does is it tells us about</v>

2
00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.260
<v Speaker 1>parents and children and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how connected each is to the other.</v>

3
00:00:14.261 --> 00:00:19.261
<v Speaker 1>And it is probably the most stirring</v>
<v Speaker 1>tale I think of a boy's need for a dad</v>

4
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and a dad's need for a boy that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in modern culture.</v>

5
00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of nail some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>intensity of those feelings.</v>

6
00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>It also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think this is equally deep,</v>

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tells us something about redemption.</v>

8
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>So the idea is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:34.721 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>if you can get your kid to love you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also if you do something heroic and</v>

11
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

12
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>you can probably be redeemed in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of your soul,</v>

13
00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:48.340
<v Speaker 1>whether we're talking about religion or</v>
<v Speaker 1>nod.</v>

14
00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You can be redeemed even if you were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.950
<v Speaker 1>really a creep before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least if what you do,</v>

16
00:00:53.951 --> 00:00:58.951
<v Speaker 1>they redeemed yourself is very major and</v>
<v Speaker 1>important as it certainly wasn't star</v>

17
00:00:59.051 --> 00:00:59.530
<v Speaker 1>wars.</v>

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.240
<v Speaker 1>I think we're going to see themes about</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and kids and redemption in the,</v>

19
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the new episodes as well in terms of</v>

20
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 1>empires and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 1>republics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.280
<v Speaker 1>what the movie's kind of capture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think nail is that</v>

23
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

24
00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>has a bit of an appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that,</v>

25
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an authoritarian leader can get</v>

26
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 1>something done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe take a little bit of the</v>

27
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:27.700
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom creates and uh,</v>

28
00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.730
<v Speaker 1>get it into some sort of manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>management and that can make life a</v>

29
00:01:32.981 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>little more orderly and people like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

30
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.640
<v Speaker 1>But it also tells us that in every human</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart there is a kind of a need for</v>

31
00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.270
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning there isn't going to be a boot</v>

32
00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:51.271
<v Speaker 1>on your face and there's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity for governor yourself and the</v>

33
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.490
<v Speaker 1>tail of the appeal of authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really kind of captures what</v>

34
00:01:57.611 --> 00:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>happened in Nazi Germany and captured a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit some of the appeal of</v>

35
00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:04.120
<v Speaker 1>authoritarians all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>

36
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently a Turkey.</v>

37
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And it gets that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it gets that in a way that is true</v>

38
00:02:09.971 --> 00:02:14.971
<v Speaker 1>to the arc of human history and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>failures of authoritarianism because of,</v>

39
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't like him food in their</v>

40
00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:21.340
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of lightly,</v>

41
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:22.240
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

42
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but memorably captures that as well.</v>

43
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:02:27.941 --> 00:02:32.941
<v Speaker 1>a country that's poor and where people's</v>
<v Speaker 1>property rights aren't secure,</v>

45
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.460
<v Speaker 1>or are you go on the streets and someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>might beat you up.</v>

46
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're in a country that's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty well,</v>

47
00:02:39.311 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>like the United States and some European</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations,</v>

48
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>but terrorism is a risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if terrorism is unlikely,</v>

49
00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still,</v>

50
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might get something stolen or</v>

51
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>somebody might knock out because there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent crime or even if it doesn't</v>

52
00:02:57.491 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>happen to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you read it about the newspaper,</v>

53
00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.640
<v Speaker 1>then you might think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>law and order is a pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

55
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.313
<v Speaker 1>corrective.</v>

56
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And even if law and order means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil liberties and civil rights will be</v>

57
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's a trade you will be willing</v>

58
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:17.110
<v Speaker 1>to take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we certainly saw that in the United</v>

59
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.830
<v Speaker 1>States at times over the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say 40 years.</v>

60
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>And while in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my view,</v>

61
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 1>nothing really horrific has happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the rise of authoritarianism.</v>

62
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>The fact that there have been movements</v>
<v Speaker 1>away from civil rights and civil</v>

63
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 1>liberties is suggestive of something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible when people feel really</v>

64
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.460
<v Speaker 1>at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what Star Wars captures,</v>

65
00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>and this makes it transcend the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple dichotomy between the light side</v>

66
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.020
<v Speaker 1>and the dark side of the force is it</v>
<v Speaker 1>says that,</v>

67
00:03:47.021 --> 00:03:47.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

68
00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.280
<v Speaker 1>the dark side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does have a seductive power either</v>

69
00:03:51.281 --> 00:03:56.281
<v Speaker 1>because it means that each of us can</v>
<v Speaker 1>wield power if we go dark or because it</v>

70
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>means that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 1>somebody at least is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled in control of human impulses,</v>

72
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can,</v>

73
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

74
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>threatened us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the controlling power is</v>

75
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 1>reflecting those forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not so good.</v>

76
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:18.901
<v Speaker 1>some people would rather live in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly society that is not a day to</v>

78
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

79
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 1>a unraveling than a society that is free</v>
<v Speaker 1>because freedom,</v>

80
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggest the possibility at least of a</v>

81
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>little unraveling.</v>

82
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 2>Mm.</v>
