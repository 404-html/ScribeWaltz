<v Speaker 1>The James Beard Foundation is a group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>food professionals who really want to,</v>

2
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:19.070
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foster the community of cooking and food</v>

3
00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>and fine cuisine and to help young</v>
<v Speaker 1>students more than anything else,</v>

4
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>get into culinary school and learned the</v>
<v Speaker 1>joys of cooking and,</v>

5
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:30.460
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully make it a profession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.870
<v Speaker 1>so that's kind of what it is at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at its core.</v>

7
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 1>It's become a very important group in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food industry because it,</v>

8
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>it annoyance chefs and restaurants</v>
<v Speaker 1>around the country.</v>

9
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and every year it gives awards to the</v>

10
00:00:44.181 --> 00:00:46.690
<v Speaker 1>best chefs both regionally and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 1>nationwide as well as restaurants and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine service.</v>

12
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's always been a very good</v>
<v Speaker 1>barometer of,</v>

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>of rising stars and who are kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>top of their game.</v>
