<v Speaker 1>Bye</v>

2
00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.090
<v Speaker 2>five ingredients that I always have on</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand you now as a salt and pepper deal</v>

3
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:13.924
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.820
<v Speaker 2>whereas that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>these days I have a lot of blue hill</v>
<v Speaker 2>farm is really gung ho into this milk</v>

6
00:00:19.661 --> 00:00:22.480
<v Speaker 2>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like we have now nine cows that were</v>

7
00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 2>milking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I generally always have milk on hand.</v>

8
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:30.190
<v Speaker 2>This is a new thing but unpasteurized</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful milk and we're experimenting</v>

9
00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 2>with all this stuff with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

10
00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:32.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say three,</v>

11
00:00:32.771 --> 00:00:35.290
<v Speaker 2>four and five is about something of</v>
<v Speaker 2>milk,</v>

12
00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>like either raw milk or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>

13
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 2>or butter which we're making from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>milk or ricotta cheese or Mozzarella</v>

14
00:00:41.081 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 2>cheese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody that's coming out of the dairy</v>

15
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 2>and that's coming from the land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

16
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:45.520
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

17
00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.040
<v Speaker 2>that is exciting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

18
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 2>we're using this the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

19
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.370
<v Speaker 2>where I began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

20
00:00:51.371 --> 00:00:52.420
<v Speaker 2>and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

21
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>we're expanding on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

22
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 2>and now in the kitchen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm making things out of it.</v>

23
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:58.840
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing more pleasurable to me</v>

24
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.790
<v Speaker 2>than,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than having that kind of connection.</v>

25
00:01:00.791 --> 00:01:03.350
<v Speaker 2>And I hope to share that with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with one Pico.</v>
