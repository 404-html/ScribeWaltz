00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone thinks they're funny</v>

2
00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so few people actually are,</v>

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a certain type of bully</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor,</v>

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.530
<v Speaker 1>bullies throughout history and including</v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have become some of the most</v>

5
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>powerful people in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:25.911
<v Speaker 1>they just use their humor to make other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people feel small and to be like every</v>

7
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>joke they they make is at someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>

8
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost bragging about how much more</v>

9
00:00:34.081 --> 00:00:39.081
<v Speaker 1>powerful they are then the other person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that to me is not the greatest sense</v>

10
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:44.250
<v Speaker 1>of humor to have because um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it's fun to slam your friends,</v>

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.490
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>you really don't have a lot of empathy</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>for the bully who's using humor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the instinct to be self</v>

14
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>deprecating starts when you're young</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

16
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't take yourself too seriously</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're not popular in the world and</v>

17
00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>your peers don't seem to be taking you</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

18
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember in high school for some</v>

19
00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:10.041
<v Speaker 1>reason I just heard that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge dude who was,</v>

20
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 1>who really didn't like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to beat me up as far as I was</v>

21
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had never met him,</v>

22
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.770
<v Speaker 1>but it was just one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he had found someone smaller than</v>

23
00:01:22.441 --> 00:01:27.441
<v Speaker 1>him to pick on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I remember just using humor to</v>

24
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.820
<v Speaker 1>disarm him and like he got in my face</v>
<v Speaker 1>one day and I just was like,</v>

25
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started,</v>

26
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I started acting like really huge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>tough.</v>

27
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.011
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

28
00:01:38.011 --> 00:01:39.900
<v Speaker 1>I'll take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on Bro.</v>

29
00:01:39.901 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Come at me Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just started laughing and was</v>

30
00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ha,</v>

31
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you're funny man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then after that we were friends.</v>

32
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I was getting mugged once and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just ended up talking to the guy for</v>

33
00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes and I'm trying to make him</v>
<v Speaker 1>laugh.</v>

34
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>And at the end of it he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

35
00:01:58.561 --> 00:01:59.820
<v Speaker 1>you're too nice of a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

36
00:01:59.821 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll see you later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of skill,</v>

37
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can really come in handy when you feel</v>

38
00:02:06.241 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>as if the world is against you in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to not take yourself seriously.</v>

39
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:12.360
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

40
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>the world then has empathy for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always see it when you're taking a</v>

41
00:02:16.711 --> 00:02:18.420
<v Speaker 1>public speaking class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They always say,</v>

42
00:02:18.421 --> 00:02:20.820
<v Speaker 1>start off with a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.073
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

44
00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>people don't want to have lives where</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're sitting there being bored by</v>

45
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:28.530
<v Speaker 1>people all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

46
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.650
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in charge of a company,</v>

47
00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>people usually hate their boss because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're mean all the time.</v>

48
00:02:35.641 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humor is a great tool to use to just get</v>

49
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>people on your side.</v>

50
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 2>Mm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
