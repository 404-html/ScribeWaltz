1
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the advice I'd give and if you were my</v>

2
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>patient I'd be a little different cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd have a little more time,</v>

3
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>but if I can distill it down to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>essence of what we do and of course of</v>

4
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the person with panic,</v>

5
00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>I can say this from the inside out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since you're looking at a panic</v>

6
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>disordered person in recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>has adopted a posture with regard to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world with the end in which they're on</v>

8
00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>anxiety is their enemy and they think</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if they can just get the anxiety to</v>

9
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go away,</v>

10
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>not occur as much or not accrual with</v>
<v Speaker 1>such an intensity or at least not occur</v>

11
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>here or there and that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then things would be better.</v>

12
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.090
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that is not the solution to the</v>

13
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the problem holding anxiety is</v>

14
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:55.880
<v Speaker 1>your own enemy and that it has to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>

15
00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.250
<v Speaker 1>diminish it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go away and not happen.</v>

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Here is a kind of self invalidating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interiorly focused process that would</v>

17
00:01:04.221 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>get you even more entangled with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>processes.</v>

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're going to need to learn to do</v>

19
00:01:09.561 --> 00:01:14.561
<v Speaker 1>is to allow your history to bring into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present thoughts and feelings and</v>

20
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:20.210
<v Speaker 1>memories and just sort of hold them</v>
<v Speaker 1>mindfully and compassionately and then</v>

21
00:01:20.211 --> 00:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>focus on what you do and bring them</v>
<v Speaker 1>along for that journey.</v>

22
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>feelings or only your history being</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasion by the present moment.</v>

24
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.170
<v Speaker 1>If that's your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your history is your enemy.</v>

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>If sensations or enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's your enemy.</v>

26
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>If memories your enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better have a way of controlling</v>

27
00:01:40.461 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 1>your mind in such a way that you never</v>
<v Speaker 1>are reminded of things that are painful</v>

28
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:45.110
<v Speaker 1>from the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:45.111 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 1>there is no such thing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's healthy.</v>

30
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>And most of the things that people do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are called psychopathology are the</v>

31
00:01:53.181 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy things people do when they try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accomplish that agenda.</v>

32
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>If you avoid people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid having your buttons pushed,</v>

33
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>avoid going to places that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasion anxiety.</v>

34
00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:06.470
<v Speaker 1>If you're hammering down drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>

35
00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>These are all methods of trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount that unhealthy agenda.</v>

36
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:14.831
<v Speaker 1>So I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we instead take this anxiety to be</v>

37
00:02:16.371 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>something that may be of importance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>May even be meaningful.</v>

38
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 1>And it says something about your history</v>
<v Speaker 1>and could we learned to sort of hold it</v>

39
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.630
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's more compassionate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of bring the frightened part of</v>

40
00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:34.631
<v Speaker 1>view close and treat it with some</v>
<v Speaker 1>dignity and keep focused instead of</v>

41
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>making that go go away focused instead</v>
<v Speaker 1>on what kind of life you want to live</v>

42
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.860
<v Speaker 1>connected to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of meaning and purpose that's</v>

43
00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:50.210
<v Speaker 1>going to be quicker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more self compassionate and more certain</v>

44
00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:55.211
<v Speaker 1>journey forward than this kind of out</v>
<v Speaker 1>with anxiety in with the relaxation,</v>

45
00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with the self doubt in the</v>

46
00:02:59.381 --> 00:03:01.700
<v Speaker 1>confidence kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>let's just snap out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a harsh and,</v>

48
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.593
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lack of,</v>

50
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>non-compassionate that place that we</v>

51
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>stand with ourselves inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things like panic disorder.</v>

52
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
