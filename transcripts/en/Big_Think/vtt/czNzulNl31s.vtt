1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that has begun to</v>
<v Speaker 1>worry me is the fact that I'm seeing</v>

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.410
<v Speaker 1>change happening at a scale which was</v>
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable before and that is</v>

3
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>impacting the industry after industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>after industry.</v>

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Every industry I've looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen a trend of major disruption</v>

5
00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.340
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manufacturing is the most obvious does</v>

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>with robotics and three d printing as of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>

7
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>It is cheaper to manufacture in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States than it is in China.</v>

8
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>It is cheaper to manufacture in Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is in China.</v>

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of the automated robots that</v>

10
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>have two arms that have screens which</v>
<v Speaker 1>show you the emotion with the sensors</v>

11
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>they have around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about Baxter from rethink</v>

12
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>robotics or universal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These robots have become very</v>

13
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cost of operation is less than the</v>

14
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>cost of human labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can now have robots working 24</v>

15
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>slash seven through the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>human beings did give it five years.</v>

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>These robots will become ever more</v>
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

17
00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>They'll be doing many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more jobs,</v>

18
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>which means that the manufacturing</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry is going to be disrupted in a</v>

19
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>very big way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news for America is that it's</v>

20
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 1>coming back here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news for Europe is coming back</v>

21
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The good news for Asia is that it's also</v>

22
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>going to become a local industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad news with China because it's no</v>

23
00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 1>longer no longer going to happen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

24
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 1>so by the end of the decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see major upheaval in</v>

25
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing opportunities and problems</v>
<v Speaker 1>move into the next decade.</v>

26
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 1>These men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these robots will probably go on strike</v>

27
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 1>because we won't need them anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll have three d printers now within</v>

28
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>15 to 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will be able to three d print</v>

29
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine being able to design your own</v>

30
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:38.730
<v Speaker 1>iphone and printed at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what becomes technically</v>

31
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.610
<v Speaker 1>feasible in the in the 15 to 20 year</v>
<v Speaker 1>timeframe.</v>

32
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So you're talking about major disruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening to manufacturing the short</v>

33
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>term and then even greater disruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in the longterm.</v>

34
00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Now look at finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing the turmoil that bitcoin is</v>

35
00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.460
<v Speaker 1>crew guys grading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You now have many parties supporting it.</v>

36
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also have crowdfunding shaking up</v>

37
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>the venture capital industry that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>become less relevant.</v>

39
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>We'll soon have a crowdfunding for loans</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

40
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some countries already experimenting</v>

41
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:11.460
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

42
00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:14.550
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking out loans by we want to buy a</v>

43
00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:15.540
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to buy a car,</v>

44
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>you simply get it from a large number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

45
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>You're now moving into a cardless</v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions for purchasing goods.</v>

46
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.260
<v Speaker 1>We may not need the banks anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We may not need financial institutions</v>

47
00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:26.680
<v Speaker 1>the way we do right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

48
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.400
<v Speaker 1>so there's gonna be disrupting happy to</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial services,</v>

49
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>whether or not financial services we</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized is that in the USA they seem to</v>

50
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>be complacent because they've got laws</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting them,</v>

51
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>but the same laws don't apply in other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

52
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>We may well have major innovations</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening abroad,</v>

53
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>which companies now used to the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

54
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Look at healthcare that already we now</v>
<v Speaker 1>have apple putting a stake in the ground</v>

55
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be the platform for</v>

56
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They basically have to have announced</v>

57
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:56.250
<v Speaker 1>their health platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they want is that all of these new</v>

58
00:02:56.251 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>sensor devices that are becoming common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which monitor your blood pressure,</v>

59
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>which monitor your blood oxygenation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We Monitor your heartbeats which monitor</v>

60
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>your temperature with mighty activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels and soon which will monitor your</v>

61
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.820
<v Speaker 1>blood glucose and monitor your</v>
<v Speaker 1>internals.</v>

62
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.450
<v Speaker 1>They want all of these data being</v>
<v Speaker 1>uploaded to the apple platform.</v>

63
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you think google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google will be left behind?</v>

64
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Microsoft will be left</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind?</v>

65
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Samsung will be left</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind?</v>

66
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is jumping into the act,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but soon when you have all of these</v>

67
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were able to.</v>

68
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>We will be able to transform the</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare industry because we will be</v>

69
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>able to predict when someone is about to</v>
<v Speaker 1>get sick,</v>

70
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>we will have ai based physicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can advise us when we're about to</v>

71
00:03:36.941 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can advise us on what we need to do</v>

72
00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>to get healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When he said the problem that doctors</v>

73
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>have right now is that the data that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>get back from medical tests is so</v>

74
00:03:47.201 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>complicated that they can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can often not understand it,</v>

75
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>especially in fields like cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the reports,</v>

76
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>and I've seen some of these reports is</v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly complex,</v>

77
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>add to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the genome genomics area,</v>

78
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:01.690
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be getting the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 1>human genome sequencing has dropped to a</v>

79
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.523
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars over the last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

80
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 1>15 years at the rate at which we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>

81
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>The cost of sequencing will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically zero.</v>

82
00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.070
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they will all have genomes</v>

83
00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:12.904
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

84
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>You combine that with the medical sensor</v>
<v Speaker 1>data combined with the data we have in</v>

85
00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.330
<v Speaker 1>the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a healthcare revolution</v>

86
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We won't need doctors for day to day</v>

87
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:24.670
<v Speaker 1>medical advice anymore would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>robotic surgeons doing sophisticated</v>

88
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:27.280
<v Speaker 1>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to impact the medical</v>

89
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to now append the entire</v>

90
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There will be no it all in the next five</v>

91
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>to 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't seem to understand this.</v>

92
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at the energy industry.</v>

93
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>We're fighting wars over oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

94
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>five years ago we worried about America</v>
<v Speaker 1>running out of oil.</v>

95
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking about Saudi America</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of fracking.</v>

96
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.660
<v Speaker 1>Fracking is a harmful technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

97
00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.220
<v Speaker 1>it is allowed America to become energy</v>
<v Speaker 1>independent and soon to become an energy</v>

98
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.110
<v Speaker 1>exporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget about fracking.</v>

99
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Solar itself is something we've become</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative about,</v>

100
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>but solar has dropped about 97 point two</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent over the past 35 years in price</v>

101
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 1>at the rate at which solar is advancing</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of this decade,</v>

102
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>which is grid parody in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

103
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Great Parliament is cheaper to produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy at home on your soda cells than</v>

104
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>buying from the grid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Move forward another 10 years.</v>

105
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>It costs you $100 much to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

106
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:21.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>produce your own solar,</v>

107
00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>your own energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then to buy from the grid,</v>

108
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 1>which means that we have these great</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies now in serious trouble.</v>

109
00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 1>This is why you have the utilities</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting solar,</v>

110
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>that they're now started opposing solar</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies.</v>

111
00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.420
<v Speaker 1>They're now doing everything they can to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop the solar industry because on its</v>

112
00:05:37.421 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>own solar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it keeps advancing the way it will</v>

113
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.440
<v Speaker 1>end and there's every indication that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>will,</v>

114
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>it's going to eclipse the fossil fuel</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

115
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>And solar is one of maybe 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that are advancing which</v>

116
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 1>will change the energy industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you have unlimited energy was</v>

117
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have unlimited clean water because we</v>

118
00:05:56.321 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>can simply bond much water as we wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to have unlimited water.</v>

119
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 1>We can now have vertical farms in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>we grow food locally.</v>

120
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>Imagine now having 100 percent organic</v>
<v Speaker 1>food where you don't have to have have</v>

121
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>insecticides and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pumped into it because you haven't</v>

122
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 1>produced in sealed buildings in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

123
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:16.970
<v Speaker 1>in vertical farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine not being able to three d print</v>

124
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.690
<v Speaker 1>meat so we don't have to start animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about upending</v>

125
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:25.691
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and the food production</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry so I can go on and on and on.</v>

126
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.880
<v Speaker 1>Every industry I've looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen major disruption.</v>

127
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 1>Even even a good old communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they look at the impact 80 and t,</v>

128
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:36.620
<v Speaker 1>verizon and sprint will suffer over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next decade or so.</v>

129
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>They've seen the landline business</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappear,</v>

130
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>landlines went to a mobile and then now</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have data.</v>

131
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean when I travel abroad right now to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make long distance calls anymore because</v>

132
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>I just call her a skype.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine when we have wifi everywhere.</v>

133
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Att and t and Google are competing now</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do wire up a regions with super fast</v>

134
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Internet access.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens now when you have open</v>

135
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>networks everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so you can make phone calls over wifi</v>

136
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>networks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about disrupting the</v>

137
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>communications industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go on and on and on,</v>

138
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>but every industry I look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see major disruption happening,</v>

139
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.280
<v Speaker 1>so the world 10 to 15 to 20 years from</v>
<v Speaker 1>now is going to be completely different.</v>

140
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be disrupting industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>after industry after industry.</v>

141
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.540
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of companies who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaders right now may not even exist</v>

142
00:07:23.541 --> 00:07:27.620
<v Speaker 1>because the problem is that not only are</v>
<v Speaker 1>people not aware of it,</v>

143
00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 1>most industry executives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not invested our money that will</v>

144
00:07:31.901 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>be required for them to reinvent</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

145
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:35.360
<v Speaker 1>They dare not put themselves out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

146
00:07:35.361 --> 00:07:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a major disruption as company is</v>

147
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our industry heads are worried about</v>

148
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:45.680
<v Speaker 1>short term performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did not see that this future we're</v>

149
00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:47.660
<v Speaker 1>headed into so they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>disrupted.</v>

150
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:50.660
<v Speaker 1>We will have new industries coming out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere eclipsing these,</v>

151
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>this old line industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrilon,</v>

152
00:07:52.791 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>dollar industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wiping out existing trillion dollar</v>

153
00:07:55.251 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the future we're headed into.</v>

154
00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.610
<v Speaker 1>For better or for worse.</v>
