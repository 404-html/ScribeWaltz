1
00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.513
<v Speaker 1>Mm,</v>

2
00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.710
<v Speaker 2>at a 100 mile run in San Diego and I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>running,</v>

3
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 2>I was running this race as part of a six</v>
<v Speaker 2>person relay team with friends and he</v>

4
00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 2>was running the entire race by himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the run was unsupported so you have</v>

5
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.530
<v Speaker 2>to bring your own supplies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had,</v>

6
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we overdid it a little bit.</v>

7
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 2>We had a tent and we had misuses and</v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

8
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were ready for like in case we</v>
<v Speaker 2>had to stay there a week and he had a</v>

9
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:32.690
<v Speaker 2>folding chair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bottle of water and a bag of crackers.</v>

10
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 2>And I just thought to myself like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is this guy?</v>

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.410
<v Speaker 2>Never seen anything like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And during the race I kept an eye on</v>

12
00:00:39.411 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 2>them and around mile 70 he weighed</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably 260 pounds,</v>

13
00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 2>which is quite large for an ultra</v>
<v Speaker 2>runner.</v>

14
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.510
<v Speaker 2>He had broken all the small bones in</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of his feet and a kidney damage.</v>

15
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.360
<v Speaker 2>And he finished the race.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it was done,</v>

16
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 2>I googled them to fascinating life story</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I decided literally to cold call</v>

17
00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:02.150
<v Speaker 2>them and I flew out and met with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And after sitting with him for a couple</v>

18
00:01:02.151 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 2>of minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized that I could learn so much</v>

19
00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.770
<v Speaker 2>from a guy like this and what makes them</v>
<v Speaker 2>tick and various buckets in my life</v>

20
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 2>would be so much better if a little bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what he had rubbed off on me.</v>

21
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.070
<v Speaker 2>I asked him to come live with my family</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I for a month.</v>

22
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>So at the time that I invited seal to</v>
<v Speaker 2>come live with us,</v>

23
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.340
<v Speaker 2>I had an 18 month old son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was married,</v>

24
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 2>still am two more kids since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I had sold a couple of businesses.</v>

25
00:01:27.321 --> 00:01:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I was in a great place professionally in</v>
<v Speaker 2>my life,</v>

26
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 2>but I was also in a routine and routines</v>
<v Speaker 2>are great but they can also be a Rut.</v>

27
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 2>And I found that I just wasn't getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

28
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 2>I was doing the same thing every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like so many of us wake up,</v>

29
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 2>go to work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come home,</v>

30
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 2>have dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>repeat.</v>

31
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 2>And I just wanted to get off autopilot</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought that he would be a great</v>

32
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 2>way to get in good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also to just mix up my routine and,</v>

33
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 2>and get better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first day that seal came to live</v>

34
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.420
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he asked me to do.</v>

35
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many pull ups can you do?</v>

36
00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 2>And I'm not great at pull ups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did about eight just getting over the</v>

37
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Speaker 2>bar eight and then started to take 30</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds and do it again.</v>

38
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.050
<v Speaker 2>So 30 seconds later I got up on the bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did six struggling and instead.</v>

39
00:02:14.051 --> 00:02:14.990
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one more time.</v>

40
00:02:14.991 --> 00:02:18.920
<v Speaker 2>We waited 30 seconds and I barely got</v>
<v Speaker 2>three or four and I was done.</v>

41
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't move my arms done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

42
00:02:22.731 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not leaving here until you do 100</v>

43
00:02:24.501 --> 00:02:26.840
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I thought there's no what we're</v>

44
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 2>going to be here for quite a long time</v>
<v Speaker 2>because there's no way that I could do</v>

45
00:02:29.451 --> 00:02:33.260
<v Speaker 2>100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I ended up doing it one at a time</v>

46
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 2>and he showed me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>proved me right there that,</v>

47
00:02:36.351 --> 00:02:37.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was so much more.</v>

48
00:02:37.551 --> 00:02:39.920
<v Speaker 2>We're all capable of so much more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think we are.</v>

49
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 2>And it was just a great lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was actually the first thing that we did</v>

50
00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.300
<v Speaker 2>a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a great lesson and we had so</v>

51
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.370
<v Speaker 2>much more than our reserve tank than we</v>
<v Speaker 2>think we do.</v>

52
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that seal said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's in the book and one thing that</v>

53
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:55.970
<v Speaker 2>people have said that really resonated</v>
<v Speaker 2>with them,</v>

54
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.230
<v Speaker 2>he would say that when your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when your mind is telling you you're</v>

55
00:02:59.231 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're really only 40 percent done.</v>

56
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>And he had a motto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't suck,</v>

57
00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:09.010
<v Speaker 2>we don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was his way of every day</v>

58
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.300
<v Speaker 2>forcing us to get uncomfortable to</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out what our baseline was and,</v>

59
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 2>and what are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.910
<v Speaker 2>what our comfort level was and just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 2>turning it upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 40 percent rule,</v>

62
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's give or take a look at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>marathon.</v>

63
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Most people hit the wall at a marathon</v>
<v Speaker 2>at mile,</v>

64
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from 16 to 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

65
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.910
<v Speaker 2>99 percent of the people in this country</v>
<v Speaker 2>that run marathons finish and they all,</v>

66
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>predominantly all of them go through</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

67
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.410
<v Speaker 2>hit the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where does that extra 50 or 60</v>

68
00:03:41.411 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 2>percent or whatever the number is come</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

69
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:44.860
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's their brain saying,</v>

70
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to continue,</v>

71
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 2>but there will saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

72
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 2>let me get to the finish line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we all have that will.</v>

73
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of how do we apply it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to not just the once a year marathon,</v>

74
00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.130
<v Speaker 2>but through our daily lives and make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>apply to a variety of things.</v>
