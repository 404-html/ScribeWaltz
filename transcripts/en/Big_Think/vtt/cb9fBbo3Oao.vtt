1
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2
00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am,</v>

3
00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just say a positional player,</v>

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 1>but active positional player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.833
<v Speaker 1>they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

7
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.080
<v Speaker 1>a purely positional player who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world champion,</v>

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for six years.</v>

9
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.180
<v Speaker 1>I had a active positional style and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I played,</v>

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>I played quite strongly a endings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was my,</v>

12
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>my advantage also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then a different difficult positions</v>

13
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>which is quite seldom in more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess.</v>

14
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.893
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>and I could resist in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a position for other place,</v>

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>probably will resign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

17
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

18
00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:56.784
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 1>interesting ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

22
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.260
<v Speaker 1>how to defend difficult positions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.720
<v Speaker 1>I could save money games so I never gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

24
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I was a stubborn as a chess player and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to defend even very bad</v>

26
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:21.120
<v Speaker 1>positions and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many cases succeeded</v>

27
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.620
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a personality and fighter,</v>

28
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

29
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't give up if I believe,</v>

30
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm correct.</v>

32
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I've broken a.</v>

33
00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.790
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could be overtures boards,</v>

34
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 1>it could be in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a saw.</v>

35
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>I defend my principles and in just in</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

36
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a special,</v>

37
00:01:51.821 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>special,</v>

38
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>how to say a characteristic when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you try to find the best for</v>

40
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever position is because many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

41
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

42
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:08.670
<v Speaker 1>this is bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they,</v>

43
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.140
<v Speaker 1>they lose the will to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never lost will to fight.</v>

44
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>This is a very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is good question because many</v>

45
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 1>people would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

46
00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation,</v>

47
00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they miss chances and then of course it,</v>

48
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.640
<v Speaker 1>it will spoil the rest of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

49
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.643
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

50
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.370
<v Speaker 1>it is concerning concerning not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>special situation during the game,</v>

51
00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:43.371
<v Speaker 1>but also the results of previous game</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the next,</v>

52
00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>for the next game you play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now in my life I,</v>

53
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I tried and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I succeeded in many cases to forget</v>

54
00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.190
<v Speaker 1>every single was in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course you need to make some</v>

55
00:02:56.191 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>analysis and not to repeat mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's extremely important,</v>

56
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept situation.</v>

57
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:07.021
<v Speaker 1>Like it is the real situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not with the salts and the regrets of</v>

58
00:03:08.321 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you missed.</v>

59
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

60
00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.090
<v Speaker 1>to mostly goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have a winning position now</v>

61
00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to defend difficult position</v>
<v Speaker 1>and probably,</v>

62
00:03:16.171 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might lose the game.</v>

63
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>So this shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be venue play when you play</v>

64
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>chess game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So later on might be you and a license,</v>

65
00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.610
<v Speaker 1>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to see then you make some</v>

66
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>conclusions by is a game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is also really important part</v>

67
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:42.001
<v Speaker 1>for a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for just education because a chess,</v>

68
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chess is getting ideas how to accept a,</v>

69
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 1>how to accept a real situation and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

70
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be objective,</v>

71
00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.610
<v Speaker 1>to be objective and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

72
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>to meet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:59.300
<v Speaker 1>unexpected situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

74
00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>to adapt this immediately and to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sink and to solve the problems,</v>

75
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to develop this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think it comes from,</v>

76
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.840
<v Speaker 1>from your childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously your bus.</v>
