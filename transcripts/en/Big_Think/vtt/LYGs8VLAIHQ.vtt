1
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.410
<v Speaker 1>The more comfortable I get as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>performer over years and years and years</v>

2
00:00:09.411 --> 00:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>of practicing and performing over and</v>
<v Speaker 1>over again for lots of different</v>

3
00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more present I am able to be in the</v>

4
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of losing myself in</v>

5
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:24.911
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually find my exact location in a</v>

6
00:00:26.991 --> 00:00:30.410
<v Speaker 1>very</v>
<v Speaker 1>visceral way.</v>

7
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.050
<v Speaker 1>So I become increasingly aware of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in the audience and what</v>

8
00:00:36.051 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who is falling asleep.</v>

9
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.450
<v Speaker 1>I know who is checking their phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know who is picking their nose.</v>

10
00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.860
<v Speaker 1>I know who's wearing a red sweater in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the front row because when I'm nervous,</v>

11
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

12
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 1>When you're in your head and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm performing in,</v>

13
00:00:49.791 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope this goes well at it.</v>

14
00:00:51.131 --> 00:00:51.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

15
00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to be physically</v>
<v Speaker 1>present with all those people because</v>

16
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:01.481
<v Speaker 1>it's too much coming at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when I'm in the zone and I'm excited</v>

17
00:01:02.121 --> 00:01:05.380
<v Speaker 1>and I'm tuned into this performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm able to be very much aware of WHO's</v>

18
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.700
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think is helpful because it</v>

19
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>allows me to be performing specifically</v>
<v Speaker 1>for this room.</v>

20
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>The way that I perform for a classroom</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fifth graders is very different from</v>

21
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 1>the way that I perform at a dive bar or</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that I performed for a stadium</v>

22
00:01:19.791 --> 00:01:22.190
<v Speaker 1>of the rehabs and people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it should be,</v>

23
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you should feel a difference in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance if you're in the audience</v>

24
00:01:25.941 --> 00:01:29.090
<v Speaker 1>for one of those shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think when I'm on stage,</v>

25
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>if I'm having a great show and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>really tuned in,</v>

26
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>you can tell because I'm able to be very</v>
<v Speaker 1>much aware and present with the people</v>

27
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:40.340
<v Speaker 1>in the room and create a show that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant for them.</v>

28
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>I try to look for opportunities to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate that I am in the same room</v>

29
00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>that they're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if I can make a joke about something</v>

30
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.230
<v Speaker 1>that's happening here or if I have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reference to what city we're in or if</v>

31
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>someone's wearing a tee shirt that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize and can associate with</v>

32
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>anything like that is a way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating.</v>

33
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 1>I am in the same space you are and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in something together,</v>

34
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.760
<v Speaker 1>which also allows some part of an</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience's brain to go,</v>

35
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really had to be here.</v>

36
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Which is a nice feeling to have as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience member.</v>

37
00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a way of acknowledging that they've</v>
<v Speaker 1>taken the time to be in this space with</v>

38
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>you and you want them to know that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of that.</v>

39
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Something that I think I will never get</v>
<v Speaker 1>over is the fact that it is a genuine</v>

40
00:02:28.971 --> 00:02:33.971
<v Speaker 1>gift when people are willing to sit in</v>
<v Speaker 1>an audience and give you their time and</v>

41
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>attention and breath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that they could have</v>

42
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:41.930
<v Speaker 1>spent anywhere else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they chose to give it to you here</v>

43
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's something that I'm very</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognizant of when I'm on stage and a big</v>

44
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 1>part of what I want to do when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>onstage is find a way to acknowledge</v>

45
00:02:48.831 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 1>those people that have come and are here</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this space and create an environment</v>

46
00:02:52.791 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>that acknowledges that and also rewards</v>
<v Speaker 1>them for that.</v>

47
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.180
<v Speaker 1>How can we attune ourselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening in this room so that</v>

48
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>later everyone leaves feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

49
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.700
<v Speaker 1>I really had to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really have to be here for that.</v>

50
00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad I was a part of what happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>

51
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.670
<v Speaker 1>I had a teacher in college who used to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that when you're watching a play on</v>

52
00:03:12.671 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>a stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if somebody spills a glass of water,</v>

53
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the most important thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened in that scene because that</v>

54
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>wasn't fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing about water spilling is fake.</v>

55
00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>You see the water and everyone in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>room goes,</v>

56
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.650
<v Speaker 1>that's water and it just spelled and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing you can focus on</v>

57
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>because that's the most authentic piece</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's happening in the room right</v>

58
00:03:33.701 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or if someone,</v>

59
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>if there's an accident and someone gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>

60
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that's the only thing you can focus on</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's the most authentic real</v>

61
00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 1>thing that's happening in the room.</v>

62
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.700
<v Speaker 1>So I think when people are delivering</v>
<v Speaker 1>content and they're focused only on</v>

63
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.800
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their delivery,</v>

64
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:52.570
<v Speaker 1>what they've practiced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they rehearsed,</v>

65
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>what they've done to the mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not aware of the room.</v>

66
00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Oftentimes they're performing in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vacuum and other people can tell people</v>

67
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:02.230
<v Speaker 1>in the audience are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't for me.</v>

68
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 1>This is for themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is in their own brains.</v>

69
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I think the most powerful thing people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can do is to spill the glass of water.</v>

70
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Not Literally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to find a moment that is real,</v>

71
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>to find a moment that is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening here in the room with the</v>

72
00:04:16.391 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>people here to let them know I'm with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you here.</v>

73
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Not In my own vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practicing to the mirror somewhere that</v>

74
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>what's happening here is a real moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can create that by acknowledging</v>

75
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:30.910
<v Speaker 1>something in the room by referencing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that happened earlier that you</v>

76
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:32.600
<v Speaker 1>were all witnessed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

77
00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.890
<v Speaker 1>making a reference to an inside joke</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this group of people all share</v>

78
00:04:35.891 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>based on where you work or where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>live or the weather or what's been</v>

79
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>happening in the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those are ways of genuinely</v>

80
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>making something real here as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping that what you prepared in the</v>

81
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:51.700
<v Speaker 1>past is somehow maybe relevant now.</v>
