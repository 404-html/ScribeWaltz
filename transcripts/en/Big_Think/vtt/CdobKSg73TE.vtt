1
00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I think the locavore movement is</v>
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and it all makes perfect sense</v>

2
00:00:12.801 --> 00:00:17.801
<v Speaker 1>because we went from kind of in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fifties and sixties in America it was</v>

3
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:23.321
<v Speaker 1>all about convenience and anytime you</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooked it was French food and then in</v>

4
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>the seventies and eighties it was this</v>
<v Speaker 1>explosion of world cuisines and we</v>

5
00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:32.171
<v Speaker 1>learned about Mexican and not just</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican but well hawkin and food from</v>

6
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>Veracruz and we learned about Italian</v>
<v Speaker 1>food and Italian food food,</v>

7
00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>but food from Ramon Emilia Romano and</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the glorious.</v>

8
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

9
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.710
<v Speaker 1>there's been this evolution of knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sophistication and it's all kind of</v>

10
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>come back down into where the food from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you're from.</v>

11
00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>And even at the local board term has</v>
<v Speaker 1>only been coined two years ago in San</v>

12
00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.843
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>it makes a lot of sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

14
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>essentially what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a food will have movement that says</v>

15
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>you should really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your diet should really be consisting of</v>

16
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>food that has been harvested or process</v>
<v Speaker 1>from within 100 mile radius of your</v>

17
00:01:10.671 --> 00:01:11.504
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

18
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>And that makes a lot of sense because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sustaining the farmers.</v>

19
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You're eating food that is as nutrient</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich as possible.</v>

20
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.070
<v Speaker 1>You are contributing to the greening of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planets by doing this and you're</v>

21
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:29.540
<v Speaker 1>helping small businesses grow in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

22
00:01:29.541 --> 00:01:34.541
<v Speaker 1>So those are all very important points</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully the food is organic.</v>

23
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>Hopefully it's been harvested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are processed in a really healthy green</v>

24
00:01:39.661 --> 00:01:42.170
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are really thinking globally and</v>

25
00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:45.170
<v Speaker 1>acting locally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it really is kind of the fruition</v>

26
00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.290
<v Speaker 1>of that concept which was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.360
<v Speaker 1>the in the last 10 years so that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>really helping sustain your area and the</v>

28
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>people that live within your radius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to me it makes a lot of sense and</v>

29
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>it's the way that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lived all those years ago and it,</v>

30
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>in terms of health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes the most sense for sure because</v>

31
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.440
<v Speaker 1>what it does is it forces you to eat in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much more healthy manner.</v>
