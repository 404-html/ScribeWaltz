00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Right when I was a kid in grade school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would write really bizarre.</v>

2
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.210
<v Speaker 1>I was always interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3
00:00:16.211 --> 00:00:18.800
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder mysteries and murder and law and,</v>

4
00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sort of the darker impulses of</v>

5
00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>so I would write stories about um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous matrons and,</v>

7
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.134
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serial killers who,</v>

9
00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were re grandmothers and,</v>

10
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:32.713
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 1>would send these stories off to ellery</v>
<v Speaker 1>queen and,</v>

12
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Hitchcock and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>kept getting rejections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I was like 15 and 14,</v>

15
00:00:40.731 --> 00:00:42.590
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really didn't expect anything,</v>

16
00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:44.880
<v Speaker 1>but I kept doing it just for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

17
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 1>and then I sort of gave it up and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured,</v>

18
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can really grow up and become a</v>

19
00:00:49.041 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>writer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that was something people</v>

20
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>did for a living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was sort of a fancy bowl thing.</v>

21
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I had planned that go to law school.</v>

22
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's mostly because I thought that</v>

23
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>would be the easiest thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

24
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 1>I like to argue with people and I like</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and um,</v>

25
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 1>but while I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in college,</v>

26
00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:09.350
<v Speaker 1>I got an internship at a Philadelphia</v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine and,</v>

27
00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:10.184
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

28
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.330
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I had to do besides</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up people's laundry and opera</v>

29
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:17.930
<v Speaker 1>tickets was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in transcribing the interviews,</v>

30
00:01:17.931 --> 00:01:20.900
<v Speaker 1>it was way before anybody had machines</v>
<v Speaker 1>that did that for you.</v>

31
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.750
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple journalists who</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

33
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>who would make me transcribe the</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviews and they would say things</v>

34
00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:27.674
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 1>note how I ask this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

36
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.680
<v Speaker 1>the way I sort of used in and this word</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way they answered this,</v>

37
00:01:33.681 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>mark that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very calculated system of</v>

38
00:01:36.651 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>questioning that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that intrigued me.</v>

39
00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.370
<v Speaker 1>that's when I started wanting to be in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
