1
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I think the question of acceptance of</v>
<v Speaker 1>lgbt folks really does depend on</v>

2
00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>geography in some places on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say when it comes to legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality and cultural acceptance,</v>

4
00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.340
<v Speaker 1>absolutely there's been this revolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>and progress has occurred at a pace that</v>

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>even in our own lifetimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 1>was almost inconceivable in terms of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly things have evolved.</v>

7
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.750
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just today,</v>

8
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:38.710
<v Speaker 1>two point 8 billion people living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries around the globe,</v>

9
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>we're being gay as a crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and in some places like India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress toward equality has actually</v>

11
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>been reversed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in back in 2013,</v>

12
00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.080
<v Speaker 1>India Supreme Court re criminalized</v>
<v Speaker 1>sodomy and,</v>

13
00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.080
<v Speaker 1>and same sex activity which had become</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal.</v>

14
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>So there are examples of countries where</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress has actually been reversed when</v>

15
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 1>we talk about how have things changed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of equality or the movement toward</v>

16
00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:12.481
<v Speaker 1>equality for Lgbt q folks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the biggest and most dramatic</v>

17
00:01:12.881 --> 00:01:17.881
<v Speaker 1>example is marriage equality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which somewhat miraculously I think and</v>

18
00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:23.890
<v Speaker 1>not inevitably did become the law of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

19
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.770
<v Speaker 1>And all 50 states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the Supreme Court in the</v>

20
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:31.771
<v Speaker 1>obergefell decision decision are now</v>
<v Speaker 1>required to recognize same sex marriage,</v>

21
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.150
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's important to remember</v>
<v Speaker 1>that marriage equality does not mean or</v>

22
00:01:39.311 --> 00:01:44.110
<v Speaker 1>is not synonymous with full equality in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of constitutional protections.</v>

23
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

24
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

25
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>it is in fact true that a couple could</v>
<v Speaker 1>get married on a Sunday and then one of</v>

26
00:01:51.551 --> 00:01:56.350
<v Speaker 1>the partners goes to work on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>puts a picture of his husband or her</v>

27
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.400
<v Speaker 1>wife on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the desk and gets fired because in</v>

28
00:01:59.401 --> 00:02:03.880
<v Speaker 1>the majority of us states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is still completely legal for people</v>

29
00:02:03.881 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>to be fired on the basis of sexual</v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation.</v>

30
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.180
<v Speaker 1>And the Civil Rights Act of 1964 doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>cover sexual orientation or gender</v>

31
00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:14.170
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a movement,</v>

32
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among activists and,</v>

33
00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:20.781
<v Speaker 1>and gay rights organizations to expand</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scope of the 1964 civil rights act</v>

34
00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>to go beyond race and gender and color</v>
<v Speaker 1>and national origin,</v>

35
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 1>which are covered a categories.</v>

36
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But at this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual orientation is,</v>

37
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>is not covered by the 1964,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.730
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess the context,</v>

39
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't until 1973 that the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychiatric association came to the</v>

40
00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:50.911
<v Speaker 1>conclusion that homosexuality in general</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a mental illness,</v>

41
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:56.011
<v Speaker 1>and that was the year when the APA voted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take homosexuality out of its</v>

42
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:58.450
<v Speaker 1>diagnostic manual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until that point,</v>

43
00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.270
<v Speaker 1>every gay person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter how well adjusted or healthy</v>

44
00:03:02.271 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>or functioning was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

45
00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>considered mentally ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the background.</v>

46
00:03:08.171 --> 00:03:13.171
<v Speaker 1>And really that wasn't so long ago that</v>
<v Speaker 1>our most progressive doctors were,</v>

47
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>were under the assumption or we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're working on this theory that</v>

48
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>homosexuality was in fact a mental</v>
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>

49
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>So I think conversion therapy is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the contemporary cousin to that,</v>

50
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>to that belief that gay people are sick</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that they can be cured or that they</v>

51
00:03:31.181 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 1>need to be cured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

52
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and certainly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.610
<v Speaker 1>dozens of medical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>established organizations ranging from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ama to youth organizations have</v>

55
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>condemned conversion therapy.</v>

56
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:48.270
<v Speaker 1>But this idea that people who are gay</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be converted into not being gay is</v>

57
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:55.651
<v Speaker 1>indeed still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is that at this point seven</v>

58
00:03:56.351 --> 00:04:00.310
<v Speaker 1>states have outlawed conversion therapy</v>
<v Speaker 1>among miners.</v>

59
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>Meaning that in the other 43 states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still allowed for parents to send</v>

60
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>their children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their minor children.</v>

61
00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm into this kind of therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 1>and to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to um,</v>

63
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.050
<v Speaker 1>acquire that kids under 18 go through</v>
<v Speaker 1>this process.</v>

64
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there haven't been studies of people</v>

65
00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:26.530
<v Speaker 1>who've undergone the therapy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

66
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 1>consistently there's this sense of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a finding that the therapy not only</v>

67
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:38.011
<v Speaker 1>doesn't change people from being gay to</v>
<v Speaker 1>straight but inflicts its own harm and</v>

68
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>trauma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is federal legislation being</v>

69
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:45.550
<v Speaker 1>considered where there would be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>national ban.</v>

70
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which again,</v>

71
00:04:47.921 --> 00:04:52.921
<v Speaker 1>I think is common sense and I hope that</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we see a new generation of young</v>

72
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:59.800
<v Speaker 1>people becoming more open and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepting,</v>

73
00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

74
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>and the sense of allies among teenagers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and young people,</v>

75
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the key to ultimately a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ending conversion therapy.</v>
