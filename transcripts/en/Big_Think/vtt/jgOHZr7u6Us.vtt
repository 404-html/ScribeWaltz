1
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.950
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you ask a related question about</v>

2
00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>there've been wonderful things that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been talking about.</v>

4
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:18.200
<v Speaker 1>Colonizing Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously putting a a,</v>

5
00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>a tesla and space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is playing David Bowie,</v>

6
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.030
<v Speaker 1>which I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a really wonderful person and an</v>

7
00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:26.660
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to a lot of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what are the misconceptions a lot of</v>

8
00:00:26.661 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>people have is that federal space</v>
<v Speaker 1>programs like NASA and commercial space</v>

9
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>programs like space x run by Elon Musk</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in some type of a,</v>

10
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:35.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

11
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.343
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I am a fan of all things space and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the things that has been so fun for</v>

13
00:00:40.191 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>me in the last few years is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaboration between those two</v>

14
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>different realms of space travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

15
00:00:46.521 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

16
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:52.100
<v Speaker 1>a NASA routinely buys space six rockets</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put our payloads and our satellites</v>

17
00:00:52.101 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>up into space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means that as a NASA scientist,</v>

18
00:00:55.041 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten to go to several launches</v>
<v Speaker 1>and landings of these Falcon rockets.</v>

19
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And that's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker 1>used to be that you would go to a launch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a big rocket would go off and</v>

21
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>everybody would cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you get in your cars and you</v>

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>drive home and it was all done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The amazing thing now is seven minutes</v>

23
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody just walks to the other side</v>

24
00:01:13.191 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>of the building and watches the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage of that rocket land.</v>

25
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>And that is something that is mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing your eyes basically.</v>

26
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 1>It does not compute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cannot believe what you were seeing</v>

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.310
<v Speaker 1>because this giant thing comes down from</v>
<v Speaker 1>space faster than you could imagine.</v>

28
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.190
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll several story high building.</v>

29
00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes careening down and just before</v>

30
00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>it gets to the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's stops,</v>

31
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.810
<v Speaker 1>settles down and then gently lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I love is</v>

32
00:01:41.811 --> 00:01:45.560
<v Speaker 1>that you don't even hear the sonic boom</v>
<v Speaker 1>until after you see it land.</v>

33
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>You watched this thing come careening</v>
<v Speaker 1>down than stop land gently and then you</v>

34
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:51.230
<v Speaker 1>hear boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

35
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>because it broke the speed of sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>

36
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.540
<v Speaker 1>And that is something that I am just</v>
<v Speaker 1>really amazed.</v>

37
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I live to be able to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love space x and I love NASA is</v>

38
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what a lot of people don't</v>

39
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:06.920
<v Speaker 1>realize that NASA is one of space x as</v>
<v Speaker 1>major customers.</v>

40
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.040
<v Speaker 1>We actually buy the rockets and we've</v>
<v Speaker 1>even paid for some of the development of</v>

41
00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:13.280
<v Speaker 1>the rockets as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was never a question of one or the</v>

42
00:02:13.281 --> 00:02:13.971
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a,</v>

43
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it was the idea is that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborating.</v>

44
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>The more companies going into space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

45
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.260
<v Speaker 1>the better for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The lower the cost of the rockets and</v>

46
00:02:21.261 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>the more efficient an industry we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully the more people that think</v>

47
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>travel and space exploration or good</v>

48
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:28.124
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

49
00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Then there are the questions about</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether Ilan is going to build a giant</v>

50
00:02:31.761 --> 00:02:35.450
<v Speaker 1>rocket that can take hundreds of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Mars and then this is something that</v>

51
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:36.410
<v Speaker 1>as a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

52
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:40.550
<v Speaker 1>I am naturally a skeptical person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how I was trained right now.</v>

53
00:02:40.551 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>What I see is a really cool idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

54
00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>reminds me of a lot of my favorite</v>
<v Speaker 1>science fiction stories,</v>

55
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's basically just that an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a long way to go before</v>

56
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>we actually see any significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>colonization.</v>

57
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any significant number of people going</v>

58
00:02:56.091 --> 00:03:00.000
<v Speaker 1>to Mars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First we need to get one single to Mars,</v>

59
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a small team of people.</v>

60
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.940
<v Speaker 1>And that is something that has proven</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

61
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not so much a question that we</v>

62
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>can't build rockets to take us there</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even today,</v>

63
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have rockets that might have the</v>

64
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>capability of doing that.</v>

65
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem is how you would keep a crew</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people alive for the journey to Mars</v>

66
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>and then also alive on the surface and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get them back.</v>

67
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>That would be very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because the astronauts would not be</v>

68
00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 1>protected from the radiation of space</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

69
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 1>we really don't know how to keep them</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

70
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of work that can be done,</v>

71
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.970
<v Speaker 1>but when I see people thinking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>space x is almost ready to send people</v>

72
00:03:36.971 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where I have a bit of a wait and</v>

73
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>see attitude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see people on Mars.</v>

74
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I would love to see space x take people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to Mars.</v>

75
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I think the Tesla up there heading out</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the asteroid belt is so cool,</v>

76
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>but there's a long way to go and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not easy.</v>

77
00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 1>I think we're not going to get there</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a single company or a single nation</v>

78
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>even.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that for something as large as a</v>

79
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 1>mission to Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to collaborate on a global</v>

80
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

81
00:04:03.941 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 1>work with the Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work with other emerging space markets,</v>

82
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe work with several different</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

83
00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 1>not just one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a single entity.</v>

84
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.990
<v Speaker 1>It's a planet going out and exploring</v>
<v Speaker 1>something as big as colonizing Mars.</v>

85
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an amazing civilization scale</v>

86
00:04:19.511 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am somewhat skeptical that in my</v>

87
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:25.360
<v Speaker 1>lifetime I will see people walking on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mars.</v>

88
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>I hope we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not holding my breath.</v>

89
00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
