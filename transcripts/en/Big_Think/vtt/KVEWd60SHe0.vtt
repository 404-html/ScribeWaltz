1
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>I think the notion that Barack Obama is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a radical is preposterous.</v>

2
00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Louis Gates Jr who,</v>

3
00:00:17.101 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quoted in my book is saying that the</v>

4
00:00:20.131 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>only radical thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only truly radical thing about</v>

5
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama is that he's African</v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

6
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's true that his</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics are center center left.</v>

7
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>They come out of the tradition of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party in many ways.</v>

8
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>They're continuations of lines taken by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Clinton administration.</v>

9
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at the healthcare bill itself.</v>

10
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>This is a more modest healthcare</v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

11
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Many proposed by others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got what he could get and he</v>

12
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:51.030
<v Speaker 1>succeeded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.650
<v Speaker 1>look at these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So cold.</v>

14
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm radical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>nuclear arms treaty just signed with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>

16
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of criticism on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

17
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama is giving away our</v>

18
00:01:02.971 --> 00:01:04.410
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>

19
00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is stripping us of our capacity to</v>

20
00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 1>project strength in the world and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>protect ourselves.</v>

21
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>And in fact the great leftwinger Ronald</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan was far more radical when it came</v>

22
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 1>to nuclear arms policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Reykjavik in the period then</v>

23
00:01:21.871 --> 00:01:26.871
<v Speaker 1>Gorbachev Reagan period where those two</v>
<v Speaker 1>men were intent on reducing nuclear</v>

24
00:01:27.661 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>stockpiles to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here we've reduced it by a third.</v>

25
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we there the notion that Barack Obama</v>

26
00:01:36.301 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>was somehow came out of a radical</v>
<v Speaker 1>cauldron in,</v>

27
00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chicago and somewhere in his desk</v>

28
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:43.940
<v Speaker 1>drawer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

29
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>in the resolute desk in the Oval Office</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a copy of Mark's and grom.</v>

30
00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:53.511
<v Speaker 1>She and Lennon is just obscene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

31
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.030
<v Speaker 1>And there are just too many elements in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media and in politics trying to</v>

32
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:04.020
<v Speaker 1>stoke these fires for those absurd</v>
<v Speaker 1>notions to disappear.</v>

33
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look,</v>

34
00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I think there is a legitimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative opposition as you'd expect.</v>

35
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Of course that's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be a legitimate</v>

36
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.930
<v Speaker 1>republican opposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be battles.</v>

37
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>What concerns me is not that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What concerns me deeply is the outer</v>

38
00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>edges of it and the nature of the outer</v>
<v Speaker 1>edges of it.</v>

39
00:02:29.391 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And the way it's though the outer edges</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it are provoked by certain</v>

40
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:37.691
<v Speaker 1>politicians and certain parts of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet and television and cable</v>

41
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:42.851
<v Speaker 1>television and all the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the end result of some of that kind</v>

42
00:02:43.311 --> 00:02:48.311
<v Speaker 1>of ugliness can be beyond our reckoning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really beyond our reckoning.</v>

43
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.140
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be too alarmist of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I remember for example,</v>

45
00:02:53.451 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>in Israeli politics during gets awkward</v>
<v Speaker 1>beans time when the far right there</v>

46
00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>stirred up to such a degree that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the political atmosphere in certain</v>

47
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>quarters became quite literally</v>
<v Speaker 1>murderous.</v>

48
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>So I think we need to be very careful</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

49
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lumping everybody together in its,</v>

50
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>even the tea party movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might not agree with any of it,</v>

51
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>but the extremes of it are really</v>
<v Speaker 1>alarming.</v>
