00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 2>no doubt that there has become a growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>concern about the income disparity in</v>

3
00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:18.010
<v Speaker 2>the United States up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ceos are making greater incomes and ever</v>

4
00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 2>before and the gap between what ceos</v>
<v Speaker 2>were making and the lowest paid workers</v>

5
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 2>in those companies are making is</v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing.</v>

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 2>And there's no doubt that after 30 or 40</v>
<v Speaker 2>years of a war on poverty,</v>

7
00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 2>we still have a great deal of poverty in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States and we are the</v>

8
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:34.180
<v Speaker 2>wealthiest country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clearly and other countries in the</v>

9
00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:35.380
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing countries,</v>

10
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:38.380
<v Speaker 2>emerging countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the poverty level is far greater than</v>

11
00:00:38.381 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 2>even here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure that increasing taxes on</v>

12
00:00:41.651 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 2>private equity is going to solve all</v>
<v Speaker 2>these problems.</v>

13
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 2>I do believe though that Congress needs</v>
<v Speaker 2>to look at how to reform the tax code in</v>

14
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 2>ways that does make everything work a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit more fairly.</v>

15
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.370
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now the tax code is 10,000 pages</v>

16
00:00:57.371 --> 00:00:57.790
<v Speaker 2>or more.</v>

17
00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 2>It's virtually incomprehensible at are</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the former head of the irs is,</v>

18
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.370
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

19
00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.203
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 2>a employee and he cannot fill out his</v>
<v Speaker 2>own tax returns.</v>

21
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And I don't doubt of any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a former head of the irs or current head</v>

22
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:14.440
<v Speaker 2>of the irs can fill out their own tax</v>
<v Speaker 2>returns because it's too complicated.</v>

23
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.660
<v Speaker 2>I think we need to simplify the system</v>
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>

24
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 2>And I think with simplification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think would come greater equity.</v>

25
00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things we should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's no doubt that the income</v>

26
00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 2>disparity in our country has increased</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we should do some things to,</v>

27
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 2>to deal with it as soon as we can.</v>
