<v Speaker 1>I feel the obligation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was called the obligation to</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:15.371
<v Speaker 1>be an optimist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that by making this analysis just based</v>

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:20.591

<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

8
00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>change in that.</v>

9
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic,</v>
