1
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>All families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all families have conflict,</v>

2
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>successful families actually illimited</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move on to actually building</v>

3
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.010
<v Speaker 1>positive memories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so how do you do that?</v>

4
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>I took a three day course from the folks</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the Harvard negotiation project</v>

5
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>thinking they work with Israelis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians and general strikes in</v>

6
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.170
<v Speaker 1>emerging markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out what they know to bring</v>

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.910
<v Speaker 1>peace and this changed a lot about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>my wife and I,</v>

8
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.630
<v Speaker 1>we used to have what I call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>7:40 to fight every night the kids would</v>

9
00:00:42.631 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>be down and we would talk about who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>picking up the milk,</v>

10
00:00:45.571 --> 00:00:50.571
<v Speaker 1>who's buying the tickets for vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would always just ended a model</v>

11
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:54.570
<v Speaker 1>with my wife storming out of the room</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what I learned was a number of</v>

12
00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:55.470
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

13
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.320
<v Speaker 1>I changed when we have these</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations.</v>

14
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>Highest stress time and families is</v>
<v Speaker 1>between six and eight at night,</v>

15
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>so 7:42 PM.</v>

16
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>The worst time you can have one of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>fights,</v>

17
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>so we no longer have difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversations during this period.</v>

18
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I changed where we fight.</v>

19
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I would be at my desk surrounded by my</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer equipment,</v>

20
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.870
<v Speaker 1>a pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My wife would be lower,</v>

21
00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.550
<v Speaker 1>she'd be her arms crossed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resentful.</v>

22
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Turns out I was in the power position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now when we have difficult</v>

23
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:24.630
<v Speaker 1>conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we sit at the same level.</v>

24
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>We actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're having a really difficult</v>

25
00:01:27.481 --> 00:01:29.550
<v Speaker 1>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have moved to our bedroom,</v>

26
00:01:29.551 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>to a bench that we have this cushion</v>
<v Speaker 1>because research shows if you're sitting</v>

27
00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.110
<v Speaker 1>on a cushion bench will be more open</v>
<v Speaker 1>alongside each other.</v>

28
00:01:37.111 --> 00:01:39.270
<v Speaker 1>You'll be collaborative across from each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other,</v>

29
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>more confrontational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is there's all these new ideas</v>

30
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:47.010
<v Speaker 1>out there about reducing conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's bring them into families.</v>

31
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Some may be right for your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some may not,</v>

32
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.520
<v Speaker 1>but I'd be surprised if you couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight smarter after reading some of</v>

33
00:01:53.521 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>these tips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

34
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:56.760
<v Speaker 1>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst thing you can say on a fight,</v>

35
00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 1>is it I is that we?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it you or is it your mother?</v>

36
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.690
<v Speaker 1>Your mother and I may not be great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you turned out to be the worst thing</v>

37
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you can say in a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always do this.</v>

38
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>You'd never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speak about yourself.</v>

39
00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Speak about us as a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to stop fighting,</v>

40
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.080
<v Speaker 1>stop saying you.</v>

41
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about things that can go</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong in families.</v>

42
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Even if the adults are fighting smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kids are probably getting into a lot</v>

43
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>of disputes and they seem incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>petty to parents,</v>

44
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is even those petty</v>
<v Speaker 1>discussions and in my house,</v>

45
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>it can be socks in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might be who's staying up later.</v>

46
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.740
<v Speaker 1>It might be who's getting to sit in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>chair?</v>

47
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.340
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I've learned is simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>three step process that can reduce</v>

48
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:46.560
<v Speaker 1>sibling fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>

49
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>separate them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in the middle of the conflict.</v>

50
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Separate them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give everyone a chance to calm down and</v>

51
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 1>reflect a little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only on what the other person did,</v>

52
00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>but on what they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Step two,</v>

53
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>and this is the most important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have kids come up with two or three</v>

54
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>alternatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually the first one is going to be the</v>

55
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>one that they've come up with and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>may stick to that for a few minutes,</v>

56
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.930
<v Speaker 1>but after awhile they'll come up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>two or three alternatives.</v>

57
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>Then you bring the siblings back</v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

58
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>At that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's four or five alternatives on the</v>

59
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 1>table and nine times out of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those alternatives overlaps with</v>

60
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>another and the kids are beginning to</v>
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>

61
00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the key here is to give your kids the</v>

62
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>tools that they need to solve the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems themselves.</v>

63
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>I used to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

64
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>don't be referee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the kids solve the problems,</v>

65
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is you need to teach them</v>
<v Speaker 1>the skills.</v>

66
00:03:35.021 --> 00:03:38.650
<v Speaker 1>You can't just expect them to learn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Teach them the skills so they can solve</v>

67
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.830
<v Speaker 1>the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you're not.</v>
