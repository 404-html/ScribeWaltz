1
00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a lot of flaws in the judicial</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:06.770
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we could probably do with that.</v>

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Elections have judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that creates problems.</v>

5
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that we could do a lot more to</v>

6
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.960
<v Speaker 1>educate the judiciary in terms of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>scientific evidence.</v>

7
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>We have a real problem there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a increasingly scientific evidence</v>

8
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>is becoming important in a whole host of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cases,</v>

9
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>not just criminal cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>and it's important that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.120
<v Speaker 1>we have a certain level of scientific</v>
<v Speaker 1>literacy,</v>

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the judiciary,</v>

13
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>much less among lawyers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I think those are two problems.</v>

15
00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

16
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.960
<v Speaker 1>a psych at all of our politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>money can make a real difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting the process of judicial</v>

18
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've,</v>

19
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.200
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Grisham has written a wonderful</v>

20
00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:58.260
<v Speaker 1>book about this called the appeal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very quick reading,</v>

21
00:00:58.261 --> 00:01:02.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's a very troubling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there've been a number of judicial</v>

22
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:07.821
<v Speaker 1>elections for highest appellate courts</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country where moneyed interests</v>

23
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.780
<v Speaker 1>have been able to basically go after</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain judges.</v>

24
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.640
<v Speaker 1>They're really interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

25
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.230
<v Speaker 1>in their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.200
<v Speaker 1>corporate cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

27
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe some tort reform case,</v>

28
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>but they're able to make some kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruling in a criminal case or something</v>

29
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.341
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

31
00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:28.740
<v Speaker 1>very scary to the electorate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

32
00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

33
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.720
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden outside money comes into</v>
<v Speaker 1>estate in an enormous amount.</v>

34
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.943
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.400
<v Speaker 1>some campaign is run and judges are</v>
<v Speaker 1>defeated.</v>

36
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.830
<v Speaker 1>Happened to a fabulous judge in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin.</v>

37
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>it's happened all across the country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most famous instances,</v>

39
00:01:47.731 --> 00:01:51.900
<v Speaker 1>one that the United States Supreme Court</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked into in West Virginia involving</v>

40
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>the Massey Coal Company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was the coal company where we</v>

41
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:57.420
<v Speaker 1>had that terrible accident in the minds</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>

42
00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.970
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

43
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of that coal company,</v>

44
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm a put an enormous amount of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the judicial election for the West</v>

45
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Chester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>West Virginia Supreme Court.</v>

46
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.300
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the judge who was the</v>

47
00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.040
<v Speaker 1>beneficiary of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

48
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.280
<v Speaker 1>sat on the case and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.640
<v Speaker 1>the United States Supreme Court to</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually ruled in this,</v>

51
00:02:20.641 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>case that,</v>

52
00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had,</v>

53
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an appearance of impropriety.</v>

54
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know when we see it.</v>

55
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

56
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>reversed the decision in that case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

58
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a remanded it for</v>

59
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:35.330
<v Speaker 1>reconsideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a very,</v>

60
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>very extreme example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately I think a lot of that</v>

61
00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 1>is going around the country and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

62
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>I know that a Sandra Day O'connor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

64
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.640
<v Speaker 1>feels very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very strongly about</v>

65
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>judicial elections being a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's probably a lot of different</v>

66
00:02:53.761 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>kinds of merit systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

67
00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>that should be considered across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
