<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 2>organic is not a matter of belief.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organic is codified,</v>

3
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:17.650
<v Speaker 2>regulated and it's definition is</v>
<v Speaker 2>established by the Department of</v>

4
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.300
<v Speaker 2>Agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the United States,</v>

5
00:00:19.301 --> 00:00:24.301
<v Speaker 2>organic means vegetable crops that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced under conditions in which there</v>

6
00:00:25.841 --> 00:00:29.890
<v Speaker 2>is no fertilizers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no artificial pesticides,</v>

7
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 2>and they're not genetically modified</v>
<v Speaker 2>irradiated or fertilized with sewage</v>

8
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.610
<v Speaker 2>sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very clear definition.</v>

9
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
<v Speaker 2>Animals must be fed organic feed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must be allowed access to the</v>

10
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 2>outdoors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.960
<v Speaker 2>and there are some other rules that</v>
<v Speaker 2>define that.</v>

12
00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 2>And in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a company to get a certified organic</v>

13
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 2>seal on their product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they must follow those rules and be</v>

14
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 2>inspected to make sure they follow those</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules.</v>

15
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 2>And almost everybody that I know who was</v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in the organic industry says</v>

16
00:01:01.171 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 2>the rules are followed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's very little cheating.</v>

17
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.520
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that in fact the system is pretty</v>

18
00:01:08.521 --> 00:01:12.540
<v Speaker 2>tight in following the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The big question is whether those rules</v>

19
00:01:12.541 --> 00:01:15.900
<v Speaker 2>make any sense or not and whether</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good enough,</v>

20
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:20.901
<v Speaker 2>strong enough and meaningful enough with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most obvious loophole being the one</v>

21
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:24.240
<v Speaker 2>about animals having access to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors.</v>

22
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>The rule doesn't say they have to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>outdoors.</v>

23
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 2>The rule just says they have to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>access to.</v>

24
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.320
<v Speaker 1>That's a loophole.</v>
