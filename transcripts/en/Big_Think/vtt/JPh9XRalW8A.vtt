<v Speaker 1>A greater return to self discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I a greater return to foresight and a</v>

2
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:10.620
<v Speaker 1>much greater willingness to serve</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>to look for opportunities out of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>American athletes and the affluence they</v>

4
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.840
<v Speaker 1>have joined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've enjoyed to try to serve the poor</v>

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>and needy elsewhere and and also a</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognition that you serve the poor and</v>

6
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:27.951
<v Speaker 1>needy best if you use the old cliche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach them how to fish rather than just</v>

7
00:00:29.011 --> 00:00:34.011
<v Speaker 1>giving them a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great inner energy of capitalism is</v>

8
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:41.691
<v Speaker 1>to make things work and to invent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>create new things that didn't exist</v>

9
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New businesses that didn't exist before</v>

10
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
<v Speaker 1>and that requires a certain vision and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>willingness to take a chance.</v>

11
00:00:48.871 --> 00:00:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And I see lots of that goodness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our new technologies encouraged that</v>

12
00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>don't they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all the things possibility and</v>

13
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.300
<v Speaker 1>with communications these days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just amazing.</v>

14
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>I see my grandchildren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just fascinated by all the new</v>

15
00:01:01.921 --> 00:01:04.290
<v Speaker 1>technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the different media and they seem to</v>

16
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>lip surrounded by them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hardly understand how to make some</v>

17
00:01:07.951 --> 00:01:09.950
<v Speaker 1>of them work and they do it just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
