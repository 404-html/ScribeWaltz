1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 2>the problem with the ICJ is effective at</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things,</v>

3
00:00:10.441 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 2>what it tends to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of the bread and butter would be at</v>

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.610
<v Speaker 2>a territorial dispute about where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>border is and our river between two</v>

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 2>countries and when you kind of need in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that situation is just a neutral</v>

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 2>arbiter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need someone to come in and for</v>

7
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 2>domestic political reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you don't want to give up this</v>

8
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>little island that somebody else's</v>
<v Speaker 2>claiming and the ICJ is very good at</v>

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.900
<v Speaker 2>sort of just drawing a line and making a</v>
<v Speaker 2>decision that seems neutral and</v>

10
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 2>acceptable to both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with the ICJ is when it</v>

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 2>wades into more controversial issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So recently it had a decision about the</v>

12
00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:47.990
<v Speaker 2>wall and in Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

13
00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 2>it had a decision about nuclear weapons</v>
<v Speaker 2>a few years ago,</v>

14
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it tends to have a hard time with</v>

15
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:54.360
<v Speaker 2>those decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

16
00:00:54.361 --> 00:00:56.650
<v Speaker 2>and so for that reason it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 2>it's not as effective as it lacks some</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the enforcement powers we might want.</v>

18
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.360
<v Speaker 2>You might compare the World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 2>Organization's Court,</v>

19
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.190
<v Speaker 2>the Appellate Body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that court is considered to be more</v>

20
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 2>effective in part because it has at its</v>
<v Speaker 2>disposal enforcement measures,</v>

21
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's got a pretty good compliance</v>

22
00:01:18.181 --> 00:01:20.070
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when it hands down a ruling and it</v>

23
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 2>says to even the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're violating the law.</v>

24
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.920
<v Speaker 2>Usually those countries comply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

25
00:01:25.921 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so not all international courts are the</v>

26
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

27
00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 2>and I'd say the ICJ is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

28
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.070
<v Speaker 2>is good at certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything</v>

29
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 2>question because the US does have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>unique role in a world and we are far</v>

30
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:52.231
<v Speaker 2>and away the most powerful military</v>
<v Speaker 2>power and we are very much viewed as a</v>

31
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 2>country that's going to win when there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>something happening in genocide or</v>

32
00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>folding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

33
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 2>we have the capacity to act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't always actually have the</v>

34
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 2>capacity to act and people do look to us</v>
<v Speaker 2>to play that role.</v>

35
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 2>So we do have some unique concerns that</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries don't necessarily have.</v>

36
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 2>That said the ICC is widely accepted</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world and I think it would go</v>

37
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 2>a long way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many of the concerns against the</v>

38
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 2>ICC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that there's going to be a</v>

39
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 2>rogue prosecutor who will go after</v>
<v Speaker 2>American service or that we needed,</v>

40
00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:28.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress passed this law,</v>

41
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.320
<v Speaker 2>The Hague invasion act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if any American ends up in the break</v>

42
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 2>of the ICC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're authorized to go in and,</v>

43
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invade the Netherlands and get them out.</v>

44
00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I think those kinds of fantasies are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are really unfounded.</v>

45
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 2>And so far the ICC has been very</v>
<v Speaker 2>cautious and I think it's again,</v>

46
00:02:45.191 --> 00:02:46.570
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

47
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly symbolic issue for us to join</v>

48
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

49
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't see a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] principle is that if a</v>

50
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:58.390
<v Speaker 2>country tries in good faith,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own soldiers,</v>

51
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 2>the won't step in and we have a well</v>
<v Speaker 2>functioning military justice system.</v>

52
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't imagine the ICC,</v>

53
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>a ruling over Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think symbolically it'd be hugely</v>

54
00:03:09.971 --> 00:03:14.971
<v Speaker 2>important and particularly after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bush administration's last seven plus</v>

55
00:03:15.371 --> 00:03:20.371
<v Speaker 2>years of being seen as rejectionist of</v>
<v Speaker 2>every international initiative,</v>

56
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling out of the ABM treaty.</v>

57
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm on signing the international</v>
<v Speaker 2>criminal courtroom statute.</v>

58
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm denigrating the Kyoto Protocol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've lost so much goodwill.</v>

59
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 2>And remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after World War II,</v>

60
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 2>we were really the architects of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>international system.</v>

61
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>We've lost so much of that that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>these symbolic,</v>

62
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steps like signing the Rome statute</v>

63
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>would go a long way towards restoring</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

64
00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.941
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

65
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.600
<v Speaker 2>our traditional image in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a touch</v>

66
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>at this point.</v>
