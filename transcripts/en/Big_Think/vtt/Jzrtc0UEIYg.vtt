1
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I think the Darra certainly tensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certainly some skepticisms.</v>

2
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>

3
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are some young people who wish the</v>

4
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:18.600
<v Speaker 1>old folks would stop talking about back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the day.</v>

5
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's true of all young people when</v>

6
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 1>they talked to old people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not just a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a true of our community,</v>

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>it's true of all communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that I think is important</v>

9
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>understanding is that there have been a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are generations in our community,</v>

10
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thank God for that.</v>

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's so tragic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lgbt community is that we have a</v>

13
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of whom were lost to the AIDS</v>

14
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so unlike a lot of communities,</v>

15
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I think something that's very specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our community,</v>

16
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:47.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

17
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the stonewall generation that</v>

18
00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the participate in the protests that</v>

19
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:53.260
<v Speaker 1>were part of that early,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.320
<v Speaker 1>uprising of gay liberation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>that are really feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of liberation that came out of that</v>

22
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>movement.</v>

23
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there was a period of time</v>

24
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>where we lost a lot of our brothers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>sisters,</v>

25
00:01:02.611 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>especially our brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

26
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>to the aids to aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there is a pain there and there are</v>

27
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.530
<v Speaker 1>scars there that are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that will never go away,</v>

28
00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>nor should they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this idea that we're all kind of free</v>

29
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>and all this progress has been made and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the young people in this generation</v>

30
00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.240
<v Speaker 1>that are coming up now have no worries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:21.241 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 1>The fact of matter is there are actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>rising std rates and rising HIV</v>

32
00:01:25.381 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>infection rates in certain segments of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this generation.</v>

33
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>A part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly my young men of color,</v>

34
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.100
<v Speaker 1>young men in the African American and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latino communities there arising HIV</v>

35
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>rates among this members of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation.</v>

36
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are all sorts of considerations</v>

37
00:01:40.381 --> 00:01:42.540
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and struggles that this generation has</v>

38
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to work with.</v>

39
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:44.561
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

40
00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the progress that's been made will,</v>

41
00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 1>will yield its own struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

42
00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle to earn the right to marry.</v>

44
00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to struggle to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>your marriage work.</v>

45
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then once we have the right to marry,</v>

46
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>then we're going to actually marry each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other and make it work.</v>

47
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's ever been married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ever tell you that.</v>

49
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest crisis of the,</v>

50
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

51
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.770
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst thing that's happened as a</v>

52
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 1>result of the goodrich decision in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts is that the good rich has</v>

53
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>got divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:15.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

55
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.630
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

56
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.870
<v Speaker 1>I feel badly for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the end of the day,</v>

57
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.871
<v Speaker 1>like that court ruling was named after a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lesbian couple that were heralded as</v>

58
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>heroines of our movement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they should have been,</v>

59
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.720
<v Speaker 1>they were very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important,</v>

60
00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 1>but they're now divorced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:02:29.791 --> 00:02:32.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's its own struggle is to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out how to make families,</v>

62
00:02:32.791 --> 00:02:35.730
<v Speaker 1>how to make our families work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to marry each other and love each</v>

63
00:02:35.731 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>other and stay true to each other.</v>

64
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a human struggle,</v>

65
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a human struggle that transcends</v>

66
00:02:41.101 --> 00:02:43.100
<v Speaker 1>all histories in all communities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

67
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's one that this generation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have to struggle with in a way</v>

68
00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:49.350
<v Speaker 1>that other generations have never had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't have the right to.</v>

69
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
<v Speaker 1>But these reits also will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll bring out their own struggles.</v>

70
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see this all the time.</v>

71
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.701
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

72
00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:57.271
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

73
00:02:57.271 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>so I think we all need to be more alert</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the differences that we,</v>

74
00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience and,</v>

75
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.311
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

76
00:03:04.311 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and give witness to based on where we</v>

77
00:03:06.731 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>are in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think we also have to understand</v>

78
00:03:08.861 --> 00:03:09.290
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>we all have struggles and as a result,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are all struggling people.</v>

80
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that should be able to elicit a certain</v>

81
00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>kind of empathy that can sustain us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

82
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:22.570
<v Speaker 1>more strongly and more deeply than it</v>
<v Speaker 1>than it currently does.</v>
