1
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.820
<v Speaker 1>It really depends who you are and sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what you've done.</v>

2
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3
00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.660
<v Speaker 1>what did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A perfection is the enemy of the good or</v>

4
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:21.150
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people will put the</v>

5
00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>stuff off because they want to do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>right thing.</v>

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think logically the way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>approach your own personal,</v>

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in terms of the environment is</v>

8
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:35.240
<v Speaker 1>to take some time to a carbon</v>
<v Speaker 1>calculator,</v>

9
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.580
<v Speaker 1>figuring out where you have the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact,</v>

10
00:00:37.581 --> 00:00:39.800
<v Speaker 1>focus on those things first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

11
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the challenge with that is that people</v>

12
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:47.261
<v Speaker 1>may put that off and put that off</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a big thing.</v>

13
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.070
<v Speaker 1>They just want to do it right and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be sure.</v>

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try to counsel people just,</v>

15
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.080
<v Speaker 1>just get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick something.</v>

16
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pick something that matters to you and</v>

17
00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:00.170
<v Speaker 1>that just feels right and just start and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that gets you on the path.</v>

18
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

19
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.930
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be more strategic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.750
<v Speaker 1>by all means get up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get on one of those carbon calculators,</v>

21
00:01:05.751 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>figure out where you can have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact and sort of do that.</v>

22
00:01:08.211 --> 00:01:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.720
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've met,</v>

24
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.990
<v Speaker 1>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in terms of general concepts,</v>

25
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very simple one,</v>

26
00:01:17.271 --> 00:01:22.160
<v Speaker 1>just small is sexy and it just apply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It applies to,</v>

27
00:01:22.161 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I say in Jasper applies to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we just,</v>

28
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 1>we have this perception that we need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of things or,</v>

29
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or volume or what have you in order to</v>

30
00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 1>be happy and we've just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whether it's architecture,</v>

31
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>you know that the houses have gone from</v>
<v Speaker 1>some close to a thousand square feet and</v>

32
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:44.800
<v Speaker 1>like 50 years ago to close to two and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>half,</v>

33
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 1>literally two and a half times as big</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the fat average family size has</v>

34
00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:49.100
<v Speaker 1>shrunk.</v>

35
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like we are a lot happier now</v>

36
00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>than we were in the 50s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can live a great life and,</v>

37
00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

38
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.200
<v Speaker 1>in a much smaller home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

39
00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.230
<v Speaker 1>and by doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the space is much smaller,</v>

40
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:05.810
<v Speaker 1>you save on heating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you save on cooling,</v>

41
00:02:05.811 --> 00:02:09.200
<v Speaker 1>you see save on lighting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you save on furnishing.</v>

42
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And it just makes for an overall simpler</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

43
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:15.200
<v Speaker 1>So I think focused on small smells</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

44
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And that can be cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be architecture,</v>

45
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:20.940
<v Speaker 1>that can be the size of your wardrobe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can be the,</v>

46
00:02:20.941 --> 00:02:22.490
<v Speaker 1>your number of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.940
<v Speaker 1>we can John's via plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think just,</v>

48
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.990
<v Speaker 1>just focus on that.</v>

49
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I think if we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we were very vocal with both our</v>

50
00:02:39.121 --> 00:02:39.954
<v Speaker 2>dollars</v>

51
00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 1>in terms of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what products and services we're willing</v>

52
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>to support and what not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.810
<v Speaker 1>and in terms of the political process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that in itself can have a</v>

54
00:02:51.881 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>tremendous impact because it also</v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts the people around you.</v>

55
00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 1>So it sort of covers the consumer and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personal aspect it sends a message</v>

56
00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.960
<v Speaker 1>to and sends a message to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to government.</v>

58
00:03:03.041 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 1>So I think if we were a lot more vocal</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot less concerned about what</v>

59
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:08.584
<v Speaker 1>other people</v>

60
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 2>thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that.</v>
