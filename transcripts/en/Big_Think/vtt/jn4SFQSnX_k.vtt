<v Speaker 1>someone who's very enthusiastic about</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

<v Speaker 1>criticize,</v>

24
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>I think dishes for what they are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

25
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're really criticizing it,</v>

26
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.650
<v Speaker 1>you should have perspective and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should have a historical perspective.</v>

27
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>You should have a taste per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

28
00:01:32.871 --> 00:01:34.460
<v Speaker 1>a perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:34.461 --> 00:01:37.250
<v Speaker 1>before you really can talk about a ramen</v>
<v Speaker 1>shop,</v>

30
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.790
<v Speaker 1>you probably should go to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

31
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

00:01:42.531 --> 00:01:43.720
<v Speaker 1>just coming on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.310
<v Speaker 1>are criticizing it because if you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>it or not,</v>

34
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if,</v>

35
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing goes with Haute French</v>

36
00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:55.090
<v Speaker 1>cuisine or a traditional Italian dish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

37
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like one,</v>

39
00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>the wind gates could talk about wine</v>
<v Speaker 1>till they're blue in the face,</v>

41
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:04.130
<v Speaker 1>but my dad just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's good,</v>

42
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He likes it,</v>

43
00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>he likes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

44
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a funny situation,</v>

45
00:02:10.461 --> 00:02:14.390
<v Speaker 1>but because there's the enthusiasm and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's the criticism.</v>

46
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>But critics have agendas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

47
00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter if you're a music</v>
<v Speaker 1>critic or a movie critic or a restaurant</v>

48
00:02:21.381 --> 00:02:23.580
<v Speaker 1>critic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an agenda you might like,</v>

49
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't like Italian food or you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think Italian food can only reach so</v>

50
00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:29.390
<v Speaker 1>high on the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

51
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excitement meter,</v>

52
00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:36.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you only really want fine</v>

53
00:02:36.171 --> 00:02:39.080
<v Speaker 1>dining restaurants and you don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>casual restaurants or there's always</v>

54
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 1>some kind of agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's where the personality of of</v>

55
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:44.661 --> 00:02:46.520
<v Speaker 1>when the writing comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

57
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

58
00:02:48.501 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>very famous food writer who will go</v>
<v Speaker 1>unnamed,</v>

59
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 1>said that a restaurant reviewers only</v>
<v Speaker 1>review for other restaurant critics.</v>

60
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm a little bit like restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>designer is only designed for the</v>

61
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>restaurant designers and movie critics</v>
<v Speaker 1>only.</v>

62
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.900
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

63
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>some people love what I do and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people hate it.</v>

64
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's always going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm always going to be the situation.</v>
