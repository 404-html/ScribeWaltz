1
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm Danny Meyer and I'm the CEO of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union Square hospitality group in New</v>

2
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>York City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the key has been to start every</v>

3
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:24.630
<v Speaker 1>restaurant with a sharp point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we go into each restaurant knowing</v>

4
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>what it is we're trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like writing a story but,</v>

5
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>but then here's where it's different</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a story.</v>

6
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a highly interactive experience and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the people who come to the restaurant</v>

7
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.790
<v Speaker 1>may like part of your original point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>

8
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:42.820
<v Speaker 1>but they may want you to do things a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit differently and so then it</v>

9
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:47.821
<v Speaker 1>really becomes an ongoing dialogue where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're listening to how the people who</v>

10
00:00:49.331 --> 00:00:53.020
<v Speaker 1>like your restaurant would like it even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more if only you shifted a little bit</v>

11
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>and so you're having a dialogue with</v>
<v Speaker 1>your guests.</v>

12
00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.310
<v Speaker 1>You're having a dialogue with your</v>
<v Speaker 1>staff.</v>

13
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it's really important to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>the staff is engaged as possible because</v>

14
00:01:04.151 --> 00:01:07.450
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant itself as an inanimate</v>

15
00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>object and it's the human beings who</v>
<v Speaker 1>work there that are the reason that</v>

16
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>people like you either want to come back</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not and there's a fine line,</v>

17
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm knocking on wood right now,</v>

18
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:25.051
<v Speaker 1>but in 24 years I've never had the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of closing the restaurant and</v>

19
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.963
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

20
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 1>the real fine line is that you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give people enough of the</v>

21
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>things they returned for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you've got to give people enough new</v>

22
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>things so they'll come back as well and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take away all the reasons that</v>

23
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.900
<v Speaker 1>they came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came back,</v>

24
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>they may not want to return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't change things they may</v>

25
00:01:47.981 --> 00:01:48.760
<v Speaker 1>not want to return.</v>

26
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.930
<v Speaker 1>So there's the art.</v>

27
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.440
<v Speaker 1>What any of the new media is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually very old,</v>

28
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.610
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's human nature to want to</v>

29
00:02:04.611 --> 00:02:09.611
<v Speaker 1>recommend things to people you like and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to want to denigrate things to people</v>

30
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Speaker 1>you liked that you didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

31
00:02:14.151 --> 00:02:16.880
<v Speaker 1>that's always been human nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to call it word of mouth,</v>

32
00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.220
<v Speaker 1>now it's word of the elk or word of</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter or whatever,</v>

33
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>and so it's really not a new thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that that anyone who has any</v>

34
00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>kind of a business who's not paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to what the world or what</v>

35
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>their customers are saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is making a mistake.</v>

36
00:02:34.911 --> 00:02:39.911
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's equally important that if you're a</v>

37
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:41.024
<v Speaker 1>radio,</v>

38
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.650
<v Speaker 1>you want to have antenna that are sharp</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to pick up the stuff that's out</v>

39
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:50.770
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>

40
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.440
<v Speaker 1>if your antenna are so sensitive that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pick up everything,</v>

41
00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>you're going to pick up static as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may not be particularly useful.</v>

42
00:02:58.791 --> 00:03:03.791
<v Speaker 1>So such a critical thing to learn to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tune in the constructive stuff and tune</v>

43
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:10.441
<v Speaker 1>out the stuff that's just hurtful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The restaurant will be 11 years old this</v>

44
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.210
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

45
00:03:16.211 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the secret of any restaurant is</v>

46
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>you've just got to stick at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to stick to the things that</v>

47
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 1>you believe in and you've got to listen</v>
<v Speaker 1>really carefully.</v>

48
00:03:26.021 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>In the case of 11 Madison Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we listened very,</v>

49
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:33.670
<v Speaker 1>very carefully and we realized that our</v>
<v Speaker 1>early point of view wasn't necessarily</v>

50
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:38.671
<v Speaker 1>on the money rather than people using it</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we first opened it as a Brasserie,</v>

51
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:44.881
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much what I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>envisioned it as they said in instead of</v>

52
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>saying this is the best brasserie food</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've ever had in my life,</v>

53
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 1>which it would have been if they wanted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use it as a brasserie.</v>

54
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>They said this food doesn't seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>stacking up against this gorgeous decor,</v>

55
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.900
<v Speaker 1>and so in order to make 11 Madison Park</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a restaurant that could fulfill its</v>

56
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>greatest potential,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had to not only listen to our guests,</v>

57
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>but we had to listen to the architecture</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the architecture,</v>

58
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>the bones of that building are not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change.</v>

59
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:19.051
<v Speaker 1>It's a gorgeous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful space with no light streaming</v>

60
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I feel like we finally gave the</v>

61
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant it deserved.</v>

62
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I moved to New York because I couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of my system.</v>

63
00:04:31.781 --> 00:04:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm a midwesterner and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really thought that I'd end up maybe</v>

64
00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like St Louis might not be quite</v>

65
00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:42.820
<v Speaker 1>big enough for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'd gone to school in Connecticut at</v>

66
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:47.821
<v Speaker 1>Trinity College and I spent a lot of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>weekends down in the city just eating</v>

67
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.840
<v Speaker 1>the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally.</v>

68
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I went to the horse races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go to Broadway shows that go to</v>

69
00:04:53.861 --> 00:04:58.861
<v Speaker 1>watch jazz restaurants obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just like looking at people.</v>

70
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:04.711
<v Speaker 1>I liked the jolt of energy that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I got when I drove off the FDR</v>

71
00:05:04.781 --> 00:05:09.310
<v Speaker 1>drive into the city for the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I presume is still there,</v>

72
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>but now that it's part of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel it quite to the same</v>

73
00:05:12.221 --> 00:05:17.221
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I could literally feel a jolt and I</v>

74
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:18.311
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:23.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm curious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like to look at how any block on the</v>

76
00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 1>street can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Literally from day to day.</v>

77
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Storefront can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can look up and see,</v>

78
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>windows up above that have changed the</v>

79
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:37.651
<v Speaker 1>kind of human beings that are seemingly</v>
<v Speaker 1>from every corner of the earth who have</v>

80
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:41.860
<v Speaker 1>something to say and something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>express are here.</v>

81
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I first came to New York,</v>

82
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I would probably be here</v>
<v Speaker 1>for more than a year,</v>

83
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.960
<v Speaker 1>but a one year has now turned into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of a century and I'm still here.</v>

84
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I grew up in St Louis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Missouri and I basically have,</v>

85
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two incredibly fond memories of being a</v>

86
00:06:05.271 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>teenager there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as I could get the keys to my</v>

87
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>parent's car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One was going to Ted drewes frozen</v>

88
00:06:11.151 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>custard and one was going to stay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can shake where back in those days they</v>

89
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 1>had a curbside service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

90
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have after a party you go to</v>

91
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:25.460
<v Speaker 1>steak and shake or after going to you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rock concert and go to steak and</v>

92
00:06:25.461 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was uh,</v>

93
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it dawned on me when we had an</v>

94
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:33.830
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to create a reason for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to use this beautiful park,</v>

95
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 1>Madison Square Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>morning,</v>

96
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>noon and night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that makes a park safer when people</v>

97
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.340
<v Speaker 1>are using it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in New York where we don't have a,</v>

98
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>an automobile culture necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still have reasons that human beings</v>

99
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:49.250
<v Speaker 1>want to get together.</v>

100
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so whereas these burger and shake</v>

101
00:06:52.101 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:06:54.321 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 1>from the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties,</v>

103
00:06:56.271 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>even the 19 seventies really grew up in</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas where people use their cars and</v>

104
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>they would hang out in the parking lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We said,</v>

105
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't a parking lot be a park?</v>

106
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it came to be and tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you what we envisioned or we dreamed of</v>

107
00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.440
<v Speaker 1>what it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never imagined that people would</v>

108
00:07:15.441 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>fall in love to the degree that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have</v>

109
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>shack burger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll,</v>

110
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>I'll eat almost anything on the menu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a very long menu.</v>

111
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very happy getting a Chicago dog.</v>

112
00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>I love the bird dog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the,</v>

113
00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:34.130
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken bratwurst.</v>

114
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm in total love with the shroom burger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a,</v>

115
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 1>my favorite custard of all which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I just asked people to make for</v>

116
00:07:44.811 --> 00:07:46.700
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it's on the menu is the,</v>

117
00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just getting vanilla custard with coffee</v>

118
00:07:49.881 --> 00:07:50.714
<v Speaker 1>in it.</v>

119
00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:57.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no one that I look to now for</v>
<v Speaker 1>any one thing,</v>

120
00:07:57.531 --> 00:08:01.790
<v Speaker 1>but there are definitely people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sadly,</v>

121
00:08:01.791 --> 00:08:06.140
<v Speaker 1>many of them are no longer living that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about when I get to a crossroads.</v>

122
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I think about my dad who entirely gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>me my love for food and wine and no</v>

123
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>giving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing people a good time.</v>

124
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.550
<v Speaker 1>He had been in the travel business and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even had a couple of restaurants before</v>

125
00:08:19.551 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>he died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of my maternal grandfather who</v>

126
00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.200
<v Speaker 1>really helped to show me that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>reasonable enough to invest in your</v>

127
00:08:30.171 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>community because it's the right thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do,</v>

128
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:33.680
<v Speaker 1>but also that it's good business to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

129
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.780
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from a professional restaurant</v>

130
00:08:38.781 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 1>standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of another person who passed</v>

131
00:08:41.361 --> 00:08:45.470
<v Speaker 1>away a few years ago from Paris named</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Claude free,</v>

132
00:08:45.471 --> 00:08:48.620
<v Speaker 1>not who ran a fantastic restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Thai avant.</v>

133
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And he really showed me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that having a really,</v>

134
00:08:54.351 --> 00:08:59.351
<v Speaker 1>really refined restaurant did not need</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be exclusive from having a good sense</v>

135
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 1>of humor that you could have fun taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>service seriously.</v>

136
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably think about my 21st</v>

137
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:16.671
<v Speaker 1>birthday at a Trattoria in Rome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was a simple meal,</v>

138
00:09:18.571 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>but it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The auntie pasta was perfect.</v>

139
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:26.751
<v Speaker 1>The Spaghetti Alla Carbonara was right</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the money liters and liters of cheap</v>

140
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 1>red wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was just fine.</v>

141
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.830
<v Speaker 1>Vitiello Allah Bolin was just perfect</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

142
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.610
<v Speaker 1>A great meal has as much to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>people I'm with</v>

143
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 1>and the comfort that I feel in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>setting.</v>

144
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 1>The food has to be absolutely delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that sometimes people put</v>

145
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>too much emphasis on always having to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find the best.</v>

146
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>If I hadn't answered that particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>meal in Rome,</v>

147
00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 1>the other place I was thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be just getting a great pizza.</v>

148
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could have a sausage and mushroom</v>

149
00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>pizza at one of a handful of places in</v>
<v Speaker 1>new haven,</v>

150
00:10:05.041 --> 00:10:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and be just as happy as a clam.</v>

151
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.193
<v Speaker 1>No Pun intended.</v>

152
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's your job to look</v>
<v Speaker 1>smart when you go to a restaurant.</v>

153
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I think you should be with the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're with.</v>

154
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>If you're a solo diner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also good than be with yourself.</v>

155
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think a restaurant that forces you</v>

156
00:10:30.271 --> 00:10:35.271
<v Speaker 1>to look a certain way or act a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>way for their benefit is automatically</v>

157
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 1>making a mistake because they're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>letting you be you and they're not.</v>

158
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 1>They're not on your side really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So actually one of the first things that</v>

159
00:10:47.341 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>I would cage when I go to any restaurant</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to.</v>

160
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:54.600
<v Speaker 1>I feel at home here because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>law that says I have to go to this</v>

161
00:10:54.601 --> 00:10:56.580
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no law that says I have to spend</v>

162
00:10:56.581 --> 00:10:59.870
<v Speaker 1>my hard earned money at this restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

163
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.090
<v Speaker 1>if I've heard great things about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurant from a friend,</v>

164
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>that's helpful because if it's a friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>than they presumably know me and they're</v>

165
00:11:07.861 --> 00:11:11.010
<v Speaker 1>going to know that this kind of place is</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna make me feel good or not.</v>

166
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:15.390
<v Speaker 1>But my rule number one is you're there</v>
<v Speaker 1>for yourself.</v>

167
00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:17.490
<v Speaker 1>You're not there for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go to a restaurant,</v>

168
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't really pay too much attention to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the notion of what knight I'm ordering.</v>

169
00:11:25.891 --> 00:11:30.891
<v Speaker 1>Something I would make one distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>if New York City or anywhere has been in</v>

170
00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 1>the midst of a two or three week</v>
<v Speaker 1>heatwave in the middle of summer,</v>

171
00:11:36.930 --> 00:11:38.880
<v Speaker 1>probably not a great time to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>oysters,</v>

172
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>which just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that they're going to be bad for you</v>

173
00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:45.360
<v Speaker 1>necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just won't taste good and at</v>

174
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:49.050
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day you're buying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you go out to a restaurant,</v>

175
00:11:49.051 --> 00:11:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you're buying an opportunity to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>time off to restore yourself.</v>

176
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>That's what the word restaurant comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

177
00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.210
<v Speaker 1>but you're also buying pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't be buying pleasure.</v>

178
00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that good restaurants</v>

179
00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.980
<v Speaker 1>today should totally be able to keep</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh fish fresh in their refrigeration</v>

180
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:14.551
<v Speaker 1>system regardless of whether the</v>
<v Speaker 1>delivery came in today or yesterday or</v>

181
00:12:14.891 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the day before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact of the matter is very few</v>

182
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.760
<v Speaker 1>pieces of fish that any of us eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're swimming yesterday anyway.</v>

183
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:28.660
<v Speaker 1>We would all like to believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of the big fishing boats that</v>

184
00:12:28.661 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>go out sometimes are out for a week</v>
<v Speaker 1>before the fish comes back.</v>

185
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like anything else in life,</v>

186
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.850
<v Speaker 1>every coin has two sides to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

187
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.920
<v Speaker 1>I think that the good thing about more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more food on television is that</v>

188
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:51.840
<v Speaker 1>we're now in a country where</v>
<v Speaker 1>good ingredients and,</v>

189
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:58.780
<v Speaker 1>and good cooking and good recipes are</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a foreign concept to people.</v>

190
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:02.290
<v Speaker 1>People are much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more aware of the role that food</v>

191
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:06.630
<v Speaker 1>can play at the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that young people watch the</v>

192
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.010
<v Speaker 1>food network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last time I checked it's rated g,</v>

193
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.630
<v Speaker 1>most of the stories have a happy ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

194
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:17.620
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that the to the degree that</v>

195
00:13:17.621 --> 00:13:22.621
<v Speaker 1>Julia child was able to make an impact</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a whole generation of people when she</v>

196
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.860
<v Speaker 1>was the only game in town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the food network is,</v>

197
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.750
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having an even bigger impact on even</v>

198
00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.410
<v Speaker 1>more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that from a standpoint of</v>

199
00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:36.190
<v Speaker 1>being a restaurant tour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing because more and more</v>

200
00:13:36.191 --> 00:13:39.790
<v Speaker 1>people are interested in and follow</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in the food scene.</v>

201
00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:45.330
<v Speaker 1>The other side of the coin is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant business is not a sitcom</v>

202
00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:51.190
<v Speaker 1>and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reality TV show.</v>

203
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:55.900
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real dated day,</v>

204
00:13:56.170 --> 00:14:01.170
<v Speaker 1>persistent journey about delivering</v>
<v Speaker 1>pleasure for other people and it's a</v>

205
00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:04.930
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very humble pursuit and I think that</v>

206
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.100
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the part of the,</v>

207
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:12.180
<v Speaker 1>of the TV aspect of food that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that may be less helpful is that what</v>

208
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:18.580
<v Speaker 1>plays well on TV is sometimes brashness</v>
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to humility.</v>

209
00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Serving other people is a humble act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the belief that if I do something</v>

210
00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:28.180
<v Speaker 1>for you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna make me feel better.</v>

211
00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that's not what's portrayed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>TV.</v>

212
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:36.430
<v Speaker 1>It's cursing and tattoos and brashness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is fine,</v>

213
00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:41.590
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really what the pleasure</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the table is all about.</v>

214
00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:45.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

215
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll see some changes and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think we always have.</v>

216
00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:54.331
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's amazing about</v>
<v Speaker 1>my industry is that there's,</v>

217
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.130
<v Speaker 1>there's just this incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

218
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.470
<v Speaker 1>sense that there's always going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow and you know,</v>

219
00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:05.180
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've now been in business long enough to</v>

220
00:15:05.181 --> 00:15:10.181
<v Speaker 1>have seen for pretty serious recessions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately so far to have survived</v>

221
00:15:10.461 --> 00:15:11.980
<v Speaker 1>them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

222
00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>it's like a mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nasty wind that blows a heck of a lot of</v>

223
00:15:15.951 --> 00:15:20.300
<v Speaker 1>the leaves off the trees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I find amazing about my colleagues,</v>

224
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.560
<v Speaker 1>there's this never say die</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial spirit and behind every</v>

225
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:27.310
<v Speaker 1>leaf that falls off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new bud that,</v>

226
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.800
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>

227
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.500
<v Speaker 1>blooms and blossoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's fascinating is to see what each</v>

228
00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.500
<v Speaker 1>recession generates in terms of the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>generation of,</v>

229
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.750
<v Speaker 1>of restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

230
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.760
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget all the way back in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1991,</v>

231
00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>1992 when there was a recession</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected with the Gulf War.</v>

232
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.930
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was saying back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the end of fine dining,</v>

233
00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:55.010
<v Speaker 1>which was totally not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a period during which people</v>

234
00:15:55.011 --> 00:16:00.011
<v Speaker 1>were eating more casually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we have long since passed the point</v>

235
00:16:00.441 --> 00:16:05.441
<v Speaker 1>as a country where people are not going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go backwards in terms of the quality</v>

236
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 1>of what they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to say,</v>

237
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:09.980
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a recession now.</v>

238
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to eat food that doesn't taste</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

239
00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:15.560
<v Speaker 1>What they might say is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

240
00:16:15.561 --> 00:16:18.740
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to spend as much money or I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have as much time,</v>

241
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.280
<v Speaker 1>or I don't want to pay extra for all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trappings of cushy chairs and beautiful</v>

242
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:28.430
<v Speaker 1>art on the walls and that type of thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>does come and go,</v>

243
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

244
00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.750
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant that will be opening this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>

245
00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:35.570
<v Speaker 1>which will be called Maialino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

246
00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:40.760
<v Speaker 1>based on my love for Rome is without</v>
<v Speaker 1>question a recession baby,</v>

247
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.930
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be a restaurant that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would hope that people could</v>

248
00:16:44.931 --> 00:16:49.550
<v Speaker 1>frequent even in a recession that won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it out of business,</v>

249
00:16:50.330 --> 00:16:52.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during a good economy.</v>

250
00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.940
<v Speaker 1>But what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I also find fascinating blue smoke,</v>

251
00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>which is our barbecue restaurant that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has thrived throughout this whole</v>

252
00:16:59.661 --> 00:17:04.130
<v Speaker 1>recession,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was born just a handful of months after</v>

253
00:17:04.131 --> 00:17:06.200
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was born in a recession.</v>

254
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the restaurants that the</v>

255
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:15.230
<v Speaker 1>buds to blossoms that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that come to life during a recession or</v>

256
00:17:15.231 --> 00:17:17.300
<v Speaker 1>some of the most long lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result of that,</v>

257
00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Trattoria in Rome.</v>

258
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:24.140
<v Speaker 1>There are thousands of them and nobody</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes there to find cutting edge.</v>

259
00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:27.140
<v Speaker 1>Nobody goes there only for special</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasions.</v>

260
00:17:27.770 --> 00:17:31.160
<v Speaker 1>What distinguishes one Trattoria from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next is the one that you go to the</v>

261
00:17:31.161 --> 00:17:33.860
<v Speaker 1>most frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there are restaurants that are</v>

262
00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:38.750
<v Speaker 1>created really for the purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing people to be with people and to</v>

263
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.870
<v Speaker 1>break bread without a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trappings,</v>

264
00:17:41.930 --> 00:17:46.930
<v Speaker 1>without paying extra money for the fancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>plates and the expensive furnishings in</v>

265
00:17:48.561 --> 00:17:49.394
<v Speaker 1>the restaurant.</v>

266
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:54.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's really more about the soul of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of eating well than it is of the refined</v>

267
00:17:55.861 --> 00:17:58.230
<v Speaker 1>restaurant experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that the refined</v>

268
00:17:58.231 --> 00:18:03.231
<v Speaker 1>restaurant experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever thrives as much in a deep</v>

269
00:18:04.171 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 1>recession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I also believe that there's always</v>

270
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:09.080
<v Speaker 1>going to be a place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

271
00:18:09.530 --> 00:18:11.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a restaurant that is,</v>

272
00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:17.330
<v Speaker 1>that just gives you that extra sense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you took a trip somewhere.</v>

273
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 1>We have a restaurant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 Madison Park that just got four stars</v>

274
00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:25.470
<v Speaker 1>from the New York Times and by all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by all rights,</v>

275
00:18:26.010 --> 00:18:29.340
<v Speaker 1>it should not be doing well in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>recession and it's doing better now than</v>

276
00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:34.341
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the things that keep me up</v>

277
00:18:35.911 --> 00:18:40.911
<v Speaker 1>at night are the responsibility that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>feel towards the people who signed up to</v>

278
00:18:43.141 --> 00:18:45.030
<v Speaker 1>work with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

279
00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:50.090
<v Speaker 1>as as we grow as an organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

280
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:56.350
<v Speaker 1>It's really growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many human beings are producing our</v>

281
00:18:56.531 --> 00:19:00.220
<v Speaker 1>restaurants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's if you go to union square cafe or</v>

282
00:19:00.221 --> 00:19:03.520
<v Speaker 1>Tabula or shake shack or the modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight</v>

283
00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.440
<v Speaker 1>and you have any comment experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope it'll be a great one,</v>

284
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.960
<v Speaker 1>but that experience will be a direct</v>
<v Speaker 1>result of the performance of the human</v>

285
00:19:13.961 --> 00:19:18.961
<v Speaker 1>beings who work there and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>performance will be a direct result of</v>

286
00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:24.780
<v Speaker 1>how happy they are working there and how</v>
<v Speaker 1>productive they feel and how jazzed they</v>

287
00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:28.540
<v Speaker 1>feel in terms of the colleagues that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work with.</v>

288
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.953
<v Speaker 2>How</v>

289
00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how well we've helped them learn and</v>

290
00:19:34.921 --> 00:19:39.921
<v Speaker 1>prepare for their job and when we let</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own employees down in any way,</v>

291
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:42.450
<v Speaker 1>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That keeps me up at night because I know</v>

292
00:19:42.451 --> 00:19:46.020
<v Speaker 1>that that's going to immediately</v>
<v Speaker 1>translate to our employees letting down.</v>

293
00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
