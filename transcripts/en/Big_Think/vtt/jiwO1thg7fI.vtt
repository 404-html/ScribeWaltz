1
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Religion plays a very significant role</v>
<v Speaker 1>because</v>

2
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>what is most important to me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion is I think it is the only</v>

3
00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:22.731
<v Speaker 1>secure basis for ethical and moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior and I think that as religion</v>

4
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:26.730
<v Speaker 1>decay is ethics and morality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the k dramatically,</v>

5
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>and I think that often happens in</v>
<v Speaker 1>history with material prosperity in,</v>

6
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.200
<v Speaker 1>with lack of danger of generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking.</v>

7
00:00:37.201 --> 00:00:42.201
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's happening again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I look to not too doctrinaire</v>

8
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:45.504
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

9
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I'm not religious in a doctrinaire</v>
<v Speaker 1>fashion.</v>

10
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the protestantism in the Christian</v>

11
00:00:53.071 --> 00:00:58.071
<v Speaker 1>church gave us that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I read the Bible and the religious</v>

12
00:00:58.321 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>classics and I think of what they mean</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me and what I think they should mean</v>

13
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:07.761
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it plays a huge role in my life in</v>

14
00:01:08.221 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>that regard.</v>
