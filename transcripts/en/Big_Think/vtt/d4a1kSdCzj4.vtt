00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:01.643
<v Speaker 1>Mm.</v>

2
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>So I've been asked choosing an</v>
<v Speaker 1>amendment,</v>

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think is important and valuable.</v>

4
00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the first amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's not only because it's the first</v>

5
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>amendment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's what it says and it says,</v>

6
00:00:17.091 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 1>Congress shall make no law respecting an</v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of religion or prohibiting</v>

7
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:26.321
<v Speaker 1>the free exercise thereof or abridging</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of speech or of the press or</v>

8
00:00:26.451 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the right of the people peaceably to</v>
<v Speaker 1>assemble and to petition the government</v>

9
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.790
<v Speaker 1>for a redress of grievances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think from the constitution,</v>

10
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.090
<v Speaker 1>this sets up the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution about what it means to be</v>

11
00:00:38.091 --> 00:00:42.950
<v Speaker 1>an American citizen and the value of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual liberties because it sets us</v>

12
00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 1>apart as individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the right to speech,</v>

13
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.700
<v Speaker 1>we have the right to association,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the right to religion,</v>

14
00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>we can think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can act,</v>

15
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.980
<v Speaker 1>we can associate freely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as a scholar of international</v>

16
00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you poll people around the world</v>

17
00:00:57.861 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and they ask us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it that you think is most</v>

18
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:05.840
<v Speaker 1>important about the United States that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think sets the United States apart?</v>

19
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.650
<v Speaker 1>More often than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people point to the first amendment.</v>

20
00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And to the freedom of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of assembly,</v>

21
00:01:12.441 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the freedom of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>as first and foremost what makes the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States special,</v>

23
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>that we privilege individuals as</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens and our constitution protects</v>

24
00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>that we need to keep that in mind as</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens.</v>

25
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>And I have to tell you around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people acknowledge that and respect that</v>

26
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>about the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.680
<v Speaker 1>I really have a hard time with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I so,</v>

28
00:01:36.681 --> 00:01:40.460
<v Speaker 1>so this idea of freedom of assembly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech,</v>

29
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.270
<v Speaker 1>regardless of the nature of that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are exceptions to that</v>

30
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>about whether it propagates violence or</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially promulgates violence.</v>

31
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I tend to come down on the liberal</v>

32
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:55.571
<v Speaker 1>side that people should have freedom of</v>
<v Speaker 1>speech and that as you know,</v>

33
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>defender of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>the first amendment of the constitution</v>
<v Speaker 1>that then you need to redouble your</v>

35
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>efforts to make sure that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you fear that this is going to lead</v>

36
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:07.880
<v Speaker 1>to violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conflict that you redouble your</v>

37
00:02:07.881 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>efforts and have police and you make</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrests and you said you've overstepped</v>

38
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>your boundaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I tend to be somebody,</v>

39
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.830
<v Speaker 1>let them assemble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let them have their freedom of speech</v>

40
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and redouble your efforts and take</v>
<v Speaker 1>measures to ensure that that can happen.</v>
