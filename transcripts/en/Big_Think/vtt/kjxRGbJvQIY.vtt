1
00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>Cool experience of African Americans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>

2
00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to start with the experience of</v>

3
00:00:16.981 --> 00:00:21.981
<v Speaker 1>slavery and the vestiges of slavery in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of the trump,</v>

4
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.890
<v Speaker 1>the trauma associated with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that,</v>

5
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 1>blacks continue to experience a trauma</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

7
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in certain ways,</v>

8
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>and certainly with respect to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>those who live in urban communities that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

10
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a infested with drugs or that</v>

11
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>are particularly violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are traumatic situations that they</v>

12
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:51.261
<v Speaker 1>experience on a daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly as we've seen and in recent</v>

13
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interactions with the police can be,</v>

14
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly traumatic.</v>

15
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.890
<v Speaker 1>So when you talk about mental illness</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the black community,</v>

16
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.891
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to began with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience of trauma and how trauma</v>

17
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>continues to abound and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

18
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>and their experiences and their in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily lives.</v>

19
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>I think that what happens for a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>individuals is that they suffer in</v>

20
00:01:20.041 --> 00:01:22.140
<v Speaker 1>silence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>with respect to having a mental illness.</v>

22
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>And so what I mean by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the greater society,</v>

23
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>there are certainly a lot of stigma</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with mental illness.</v>

24
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of antithetical to the</v>

25
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>American ethic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is to,</v>

26
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be strong and courageous to pull</v>

27
00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:47.250
<v Speaker 1>yourself up by the bootstrap to weather</v>
<v Speaker 1>the storm,</v>

28
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>etc. I think the second part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.320
<v Speaker 1>point is what's happening at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>community level or the society level.</v>

30
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And I think what happens is that within</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black community,</v>

31
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.380
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that again,</v>

32
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that ethic about what it means to be</v>

33
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>strong and courageous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 1>is particularly pronounced because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>of trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.680
<v Speaker 1>combat those forces like discrimination</v>
<v Speaker 1>or racism.</v>

37
00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.750
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

38
00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:22.080
<v Speaker 1>it just adds to the burden of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

39
00:02:22.081 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>sort of what it means to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then the person who is struggling</v>

40
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:29.410
<v Speaker 1>with the mental illnesses perhaps not</v>
<v Speaker 1>embraced or you know,</v>

41
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>warmly accepted because of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles.</v>

42
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>

43
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.590
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

44
00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:35.281
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a,</v>

45
00:02:35.281 --> 00:02:38.880
<v Speaker 1>as a young person growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to hear about the person who was</v>

46
00:02:38.881 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>quote unquote sitting down south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to wonder what that meant.</v>

47
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.110
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't until I got older that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>became more knowledgeable of the fact</v>

48
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>that a purse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that person was struggling with a mental</v>

49
00:02:52.141 --> 00:02:55.380
<v Speaker 1>illness or perhaps substance abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a historical perspective,</v>

50
00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of emphasis and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black community,</v>

51
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>particularly in back families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

52
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:06.280
<v Speaker 1>on keeping your problems close to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>vest and the home,</v>

53
00:03:06.281 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>you don't share what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 1>outsiders.</v>

54
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:14.371
<v Speaker 1>No one can treat you as best as your</v>
<v Speaker 1>family can.</v>

55
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>You bring all your burdens and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems to your family.</v>

56
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you do take it any to any entity</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of your family,</v>

57
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it's the black church.</v>

58
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.150
<v Speaker 1>The church is really important in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>black community and make no mistake</v>

59
00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:33.850
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

60
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.540
<v Speaker 1>a source of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

61
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of salvation and uh,</v>

62
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.410
<v Speaker 1>and the healing and there's a whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>collective support,</v>

63
00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

64
00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get from your fellow church goers</v>

65
00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.240
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think also what has historically</v>

66
00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:52.520
<v Speaker 1>happened is died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the church has been defined as the place</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sort of relieve your symptoms or to</v>

68
00:04:00.741 --> 00:04:03.830
<v Speaker 1>address your burdens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it stops there.</v>

69
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.680
<v Speaker 1>And what I think needs to happen is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

70
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think pastors and lay ministers can be</v>

71
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:12.320
<v Speaker 1>more trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

72
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:16.310
<v Speaker 1>and the signs and presentations of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mental illness.</v>

73
00:04:16.311 --> 00:04:19.220
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the church could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of a triage unit,</v>

74
00:04:19.221 --> 00:04:22.880
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that it identifies those who have</v>

75
00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:27.860
<v Speaker 1>needs and it's that sort of first step</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the sort of entree into care.</v>

76
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>But it shouldn't stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that culturally competent care</v>

77
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>is critical to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If patients perceive that providers are</v>

78
00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>inauthentic and do not care about their</v>
<v Speaker 1>unique circumstances,</v>

79
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>then they're likely to be turned off at</v>
<v Speaker 1>our baseline.</v>

80
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:54.011
<v Speaker 1>Providers should understand there the</v>
<v Speaker 1>history of their neighborhoods,</v>

81
00:04:54.261 --> 00:04:58.340
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the history of the experience of,</v>

82
00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of African Americans and Latinos,</v>

83
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such that they can put the clinical</v>

84
00:05:05.631 --> 00:05:10.631
<v Speaker 1>presentation into context and understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>what unique factors,</v>

85
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in play with respect to the clinical</v>

86
00:05:15.471 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 1>presentation and how that person is</v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking to,</v>

87
00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>survive and live in the world as an</v>

88
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:27.491
<v Speaker 1>African American or Latino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think that it's the onus is on</v>

89
00:05:27.861 --> 00:05:32.861
<v Speaker 1>the provider to understand that context</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to understand what it means,</v>

90
00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.670
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for that person to live in that context.</v>
