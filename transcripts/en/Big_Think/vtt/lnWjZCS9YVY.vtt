00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Is Peter White and I teach in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics department at Columbia</v>

2
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or my title is senior lecturer.</v>

3
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing I'd say is that when</v>

4
00:00:17.271 --> 00:00:19.610
<v Speaker 1>people set talk about string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually talking about a very</v>

5
00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>complex set of ideas that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of people,</v>

6
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very large amount people have worked on</v>

7
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 1>and done a lot of different things with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

8
00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the probably what it's best known for</v>

9
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.780
<v Speaker 1>and what got people all excited about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the physics community is,</v>

10
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of like the conjecture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of at the most fundamental level</v>

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.950
<v Speaker 1>you can understand matter in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe in,</v>

12
00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>in terms not of point particles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

13
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.100
<v Speaker 1>which is the way our best theories</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently you kind of understand things.</v>

14
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>But in terms of kind of vibrating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you like vibrating kind of loops of</v>

15
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>some elementary objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're at your elementary object</v>

16
00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>instead of being a point like thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you should think of more as</v>

17
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:59.990
<v Speaker 1>being a one dimensional loop or a kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of string string,</v>

18
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:01.160
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of moving around.</v>

19
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.550
<v Speaker 1>So it has a lot more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.830
<v Speaker 1>it can do a lot more complicated things</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a point.</v>

21
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.940
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of loop of elementary</v>
<v Speaker 1>matter,</v>

22
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

23
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>it gives you a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different kind of class of,</v>

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>of theories and then the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

25
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.110
<v Speaker 1>we've been so successful with before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

26
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.000
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cafe.</v>

27
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>So during the 60s that this idea was</v>
<v Speaker 1>initially developed and initially people</v>

28
00:01:26.751 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>tried to do one thing with these class</v>
<v Speaker 1>of theories,</v>

29
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>something which didn't work out that</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

30
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.450
<v Speaker 1>And then starting in the late seventies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and eighties,</v>

31
00:01:35.451 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>people then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

32
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>came up with the conjecture that maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really could unify all of physics</v>

33
00:01:40.761 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 1>and solve some of the open problems in</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics by replacing our standard</v>

34
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>theories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we call the standard model with</v>

35
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>some kind of string theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's so,</v>

36
00:01:50.571 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>so since this idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became very popular in 1984 and so</v>

37
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:55.460
<v Speaker 1>it's been now 25 years.</v>

38
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>People have been working very hard on</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

39
00:01:56.871 --> 00:01:57.704
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

40
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.690
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think just the initial thing,</v>

41
00:01:59.691 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>I've got people very excited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least I would claim,</v>

42
00:02:02.381 --> 00:02:03.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hasn't worked out and really</v>

43
00:02:03.891 --> 00:02:06.020
<v Speaker 1>can't work out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of been,</v>

44
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.610
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of the reason controversy</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been an argument over this issue of,</v>

45
00:02:10.611 --> 00:02:11.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether this,</v>

46
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a speculative idea about whether you</v>

47
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 1>can use the strings to develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a unified theory about whether</v>

48
00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>that really has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

49
00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:22.010
<v Speaker 1>is that an idea that's failed or is</v>
<v Speaker 1>there still some hope for it?</v>

50
00:02:22.011 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>what's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the controversial part of it?</v>

52
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main thing to understand about the</v>

53
00:02:33.061 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>current state of physics is that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense kind of a victim of our</v>

54
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>own success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have an incredibly successful theory</v>

55
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>called the standard model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

56
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

57
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.730
<v Speaker 1>it really explains everything that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can observe about,</v>

58
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of a fairly small number of</v>

59
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>elementary particles and some basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>forces between them.</v>

60
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a quite beautiful theory ended.</v>

61
00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really just kind of absurdly</v>

62
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>successful every experiment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anybody knows how to do that in</v>

63
00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:01.140
<v Speaker 1>principle can be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

64
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this theory has something to say about</v>

65
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.351
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It works.</v>

66
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.480
<v Speaker 1>It works out perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.890
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to whatever experimental,</v>

68
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in whenever you need,</v>

69
00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:14.200
<v Speaker 1>how you can do an experiment to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>precision.</v>

70
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>And it comes out exactly as predicted by</v>
<v Speaker 1>this model.</v>

71
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 1>So we have kind of a semi unified</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

72
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.100
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this quite nice,</v>

73
00:03:21.101 --> 00:03:23.650
<v Speaker 1>beautiful structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which explains everything we can see.</v>

74
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.210
<v Speaker 1>But it still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still leaves open.</v>

75
00:03:26.211 --> 00:03:31.000
<v Speaker 1>So several questions and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the questions are just to kind</v>

76
00:03:31.001 --> 00:03:32.020
<v Speaker 1>of why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>we have all these different particles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have different masses.</v>

78
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>Why do they all have different masses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't understand why the electron has</v>

79
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>a certain mass quirks of other masses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

80
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 1>so they're just kind of things which the</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory just doesn't address.</v>

81
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't answer these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they're questions that,</v>

82
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>which has physicists we think there</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be answers to.</v>

83
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.590
<v Speaker 1>But then there's also one kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>remaining forest,</v>

84
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>which isn't part of the standard model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the four,</v>

85
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>which is the gravitational force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

86
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gravitational force is much,</v>

87
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:03.840
<v Speaker 1>much weaker than these other forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

88
00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:05.410
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a somewhat different nature.</v>

89
00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with it is that we don't,</v>

90
00:04:08.351 --> 00:04:11.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>w w the,</v>

91
00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:11.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

92
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.380
<v Speaker 1>these other forces that we have</v>
<v Speaker 1>something which is a quantum theory.</v>

93
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>It really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

94
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>it's quantum mechanics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really works down to the microscopic</v>

95
00:04:19.601 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in terms of this very fundamental</v>

96
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>idea about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about reality called quantum mechanics,</v>

97
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the theory of gravity that we still use</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Einstein's theory of general</v>

98
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:31.180
<v Speaker 1>relativity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's what we call a classical</v>

99
00:04:31.181 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a quantum mechanical theory.</v>

100
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.593
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

101
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.820
<v Speaker 1>you can make an estimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that you can make an</v>

102
00:04:36.821 --> 00:04:40.210
<v Speaker 1>estimate within this theory of how big</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanical effects would be.</v>

103
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And that estimate tells you that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so absurdly small.</v>

104
00:04:43.361 --> 00:04:46.720
<v Speaker 1>You can never hope to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's kind of a problem with</v>

105
00:04:46.721 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>principal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had this theory,</v>

106
00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:50.200
<v Speaker 1>which is not a proper quantum mechanical</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

107
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>And we know that there's things which it</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't quite properly explained,</v>

108
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.090
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

109
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.010
<v Speaker 1>they're far too small for us to study</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and to,</v>

110
00:04:58.011 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

111
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>to try to see them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we would anyways.</v>

112
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not completely happy with this</v>

113
00:05:03.431 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a,</v>

114
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.580
<v Speaker 1>a force which doesn't quite fit with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>others and uh,</v>

115
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.600
<v Speaker 1>which for logical reasons that we would</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to unify it with these others and</v>

116
00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.900
<v Speaker 1>think and understand it as a quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanical theory and,</v>

117
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:16.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've never quite been successful and</v>

118
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.080
<v Speaker 1>able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

119
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>and this is what strict string theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

120
00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>It was kind of a promise of a way of how</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

121
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.070
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

122
00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why people got so excited.</v>

123
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Kinda,</v>

124
00:05:31.221 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a famous phrase among</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists.</v>

125
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It goes back to a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a well known theorist called</v>

126
00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Wolfgang Pauli and the in the 50s</v>
<v Speaker 1>stories that towards the end of his</v>

127
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:39.454
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

128
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was well known for being a very kind</v>

129
00:05:43.541 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>of hyper critical of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

130
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.000
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

131
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 1>of things that were going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And we'll get up the middle of a seminar</v>

132
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>and started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:50.920
<v Speaker 1>it's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely wrong.</v>

134
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And late in his life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone asked him about some work that</v>

135
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:57.130
<v Speaker 1>was some of some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some speculative idea of someone and</v>

136
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 1>heavily he shook his head and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

137
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>that one's not even wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

138
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>and so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

139
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

140
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a well known phrase among</v>

141
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:08.050
<v Speaker 1>physicists and it kind of carries I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think two,</v>

142
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>two meanings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

143
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>w w one one of them is just kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>more somewhat of a term of abuse.</v>

144
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so bad.</v>

145
00:06:16.401 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not even wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

146
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>but there's a more interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's also more kind of technical</v>

147
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>meaning that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very often used,</v>

148
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>you have respect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have expected of idea.</v>

149
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.000
<v Speaker 1>And if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's not a very good idea or it turns</v>

150
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>out you actually can't even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up not being able to do very</v>

151
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>much with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you end up not being able to,</v>

152
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to predict anything with it or to,</v>

153
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it's just not useful.</v>

154
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>So there's also a notion of not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even wrong in the sense that it's</v>

155
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:49.460
<v Speaker 1>not an idea which can be fully developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or it can turn into something which is</v>

156
00:06:49.461 --> 00:06:51.960
<v Speaker 1>powerful enough to actually predict</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and be wrong.</v>

157
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 1>So this one problem is string theory is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's kind of a I theory,</v>

158
00:06:58.281 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>which they could explain what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems are,</v>

159
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 1>but the problems are such that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever even pin it down and say this is</v>

160
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it predicts and let's go</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and test it.</v>

161
00:07:06.531 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's not even capable of being wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being wrong or being falsified are being</v>

162
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>shown to be wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the more relevant meaning</v>

163
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:14.864
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

164
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's string theory is actually a</v>

165
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 1>very complicated stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

166
00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:24.461
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

167
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you start out with this hypothesis</v>

168
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.780
<v Speaker 1>that maybe you're are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our fundamental objects are not points,</v>

169
00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>but are these strings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of different things you</v>

170
00:07:32.001 --> 00:07:33.310
<v Speaker 1>can try and do that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

171
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a whole different class of</v>

172
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 1>theories you can play with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I think a lot of,</v>

173
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>if you look at what most people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still doing string theory doing,</v>

174
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>they're actually not directly trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

175
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.450
<v Speaker 1>to develop as unified theory anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're off kind of doing other things</v>

176
00:07:50.451 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>with string theory there that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>these days are trying to apply it to um,</v>

177
00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:57.920
<v Speaker 1>to problems and nuclear physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're applying it to problems and,</v>

178
00:07:57.921 --> 00:07:59.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in solid state physics,</v>

179
00:07:59.421 --> 00:08:01.790
<v Speaker 1>understanding superconductors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

180
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.520
<v Speaker 1>the people who still are interested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

181
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:04.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

182
00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are often kind of,</v>

183
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>even if they will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may or may not explicitly admit</v>

184
00:08:10.851 --> 00:08:13.040
<v Speaker 1>that they've kind of given up on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>unified theory idea,</v>

185
00:08:13.041 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're often doing other things.</v>

186
00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.920
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very active,</v>

187
00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.100
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuit of string theory in,</v>

188
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with other applications that don't have</v>

189
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 1>any to do with unification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also turned out to be very</v>

190
00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:25.100
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in mathematics,</v>

191
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>there's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I'm most</v>

192
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:30.770
<v Speaker 1>interested in is the intersection</v>
<v Speaker 1>between mathematics and physics and um,</v>

193
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:34.970
<v Speaker 1>the way the two fields kind of affect</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other and ideas from physics lead</v>

194
00:08:34.971 --> 00:08:36.410
<v Speaker 1>to very interesting things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics,</v>

195
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.470
<v Speaker 1>ideas and mathematics get used and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us new physics.</v>

196
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>And string theory has been very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fruitful in terms of raising</v>

197
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:45.020
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm happy to have led to very</v>

198
00:08:45.021 --> 00:08:47.870
<v Speaker 1>interesting mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a very active field of</v>

199
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:51.930
<v Speaker 1>research given between math and physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>in string theory,</v>

200
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:52.221
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>

201
00:08:52.221 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>but it just doesn't seem to be relevant</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this question of unification.</v>

202
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly shouldn't.</v>

203
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.330
<v Speaker 1>My critical criticism of string theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not that,</v>

204
00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:04.081
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

205
00:09:04.081 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>if you guys would just realize that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>should be doing such and such,</v>

206
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would solve a lot of problems.</v>

207
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

208
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that I have some my own</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>

209
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 1>which I'm very excited by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which at which I'm pursuing,</v>

210
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:19.290
<v Speaker 1>which are also new ideas about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use mathematics to do things in physics,</v>

211
00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 1>which don't have anything to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>string theory.</v>

212
00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:21.901
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

213
00:09:21.901 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of at least lead me to see</v>

214
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.000
<v Speaker 1>you there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

215
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things we don't understand</v>

216
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 1>which are closer to are the standard</v>
<v Speaker 1>model which we,</v>

217
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.730
<v Speaker 1>which we do know works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of kind of mathematical</v>

218
00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.780
<v Speaker 1>mathematical structure behind the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

219
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.720
<v Speaker 1>the standard model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is still kind of mysterious and</v>

220
00:09:39.721 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 1>which is not well understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think pursuing that is more likely</v>

221
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 1>to get us somewhere then the districts</v>
<v Speaker 1>or unification idea,</v>

222
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>just because you're starting from</v>
<v Speaker 1>something which,</v>

223
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:50.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a theory which you know is right.</v>

224
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>And trying to further develop your</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of that theory is maybe a</v>

225
00:09:54.061 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>more fruitful thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm trying to,</v>

226
00:09:56.881 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just kinda throw out,</v>

227
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.820
<v Speaker 1>throw the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw all that out and start a fresh</v>

228
00:09:59.821 --> 00:10:02.330
<v Speaker 1>with something more speculative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

229
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it gets one thing to talk about</v>

230
00:10:05.401 --> 00:10:05.911
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the,</v>

231
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:06.631
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

232
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:09.770
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in Geneva even that,</v>

233
00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:10.531
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this month,</v>

234
00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:11.331
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the,</v>

235
00:10:11.331 --> 00:10:12.240
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the,</v>

236
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.210
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the problem with the field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I've said,</v>

237
00:10:15.211 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>is this business of being a victim of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our own success,</v>

238
00:10:17.221 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 1>not having any experimental results of</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree with the theory,</v>

239
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:22.640
<v Speaker 1>which makes it very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to figure out how to,</v>

240
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:27.800
<v Speaker 1>how do you improve a theory if you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>got no kind of clues as to what,</v>

241
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:29.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

242
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:30.931
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

243
00:10:30.931 --> 00:10:32.850
<v Speaker 1>what might possibly be wrong that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be,</v>

244
00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:33.810
<v Speaker 1>needs to be changed.</v>

245
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this accelerator called the LHC okay.</v>

246
00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>At cern in Geneva.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been in development for quite a</v>

247
00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>few years now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's been a long process getting it</v>

248
00:10:43.831 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 1>working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just over the past month,</v>

249
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they've finally got it to inject beams</v>
<v Speaker 1>into this accelerator and start</v>

250
00:10:50.041 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 1>colliding these beams and start doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new physics.</v>

251
00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.430
<v Speaker 1>And over the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll start raising the energy of this</v>

252
00:10:56.431 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>accelerator to the point where we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

253
00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll be in in a new energy regime</v>

254
00:11:01.201 --> 00:11:02.910
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which allows us to,</v>

255
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:03.744
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

256
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.260
<v Speaker 1>to get experimental data about what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening at higher energy,</v>

257
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.080
<v Speaker 1>which also coat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which corresponds to what's happening at</v>

258
00:11:10.081 --> 00:11:13.800
<v Speaker 1>shorter and shorter distances to um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see what's happening in shortage.</v>

259
00:11:13.801 --> 00:11:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Shorter distances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In some sense you need to use shorter</v>

260
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 1>and shorter wavelength or higher and</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher energy probes.</v>

261
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.483
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

262
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.460
<v Speaker 1>this new accelerator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>pr finally promises some data in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>new energy range beyond what we've been</v>

264
00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:28.440
<v Speaker 1>able to see so far.</v>

265
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are reasons to believe that this</v>

266
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:33.480
<v Speaker 1>new energy range is one where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

267
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 1>that we can actually start to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>answers to some of these questions</v>

268
00:11:36.181 --> 00:11:37.380
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially about mass,</v>

269
00:11:37.381 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>about why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did different particles have</v>

270
00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:41.260
<v Speaker 1>different masses?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

271
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.091
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

272
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:47.280
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the state of the standard model is</v>

273
00:11:47.281 --> 00:11:49.830
<v Speaker 1>that it's as quite beautiful theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you,</v>

274
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:52.530
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the whole thing work,</v>

275
00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.060
<v Speaker 1>you need a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need,</v>

276
00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:58.430
<v Speaker 1>you need to make sure that a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of physical phenomenon.</v>

277
00:11:58.431 --> 00:12:01.990
<v Speaker 1>It has to happen basically in one way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying it is that the theory has certain</v>

278
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:03.420
<v Speaker 1>symmetry is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

279
00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.170
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

280
00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.660
<v Speaker 1>the lowest tenant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lowest energy theory,</v>

281
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 1>the lowest energy state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vacuum of the theory has to have</v>

282
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 1>nontrivial properties under one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cemeteries.</v>

283
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.870
<v Speaker 1>It can't normally you say vacuum state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of completely and</v>

284
00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:20.020
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you rotate it around,</v>

285
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:21.370
<v Speaker 1>move it around the vacuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature can't,</v>

286
00:12:21.371 --> 00:12:22.090
<v Speaker 1>nothing can happen.</v>

287
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.950
<v Speaker 1>It's just a vacuum state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

288
00:12:23.951 --> 00:12:27.190
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the vacuum actually has to have</v>

289
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:30.820
<v Speaker 1>interesting properties under these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mathematical symmetry transformations</v>

290
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 1>and the so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

291
00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 1>so we know that that has to be true in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to make the theory work.</v>

292
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 1>And there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many ways you can imagine,</v>

293
00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:41.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making that happen.</v>

294
00:12:41.711 --> 00:12:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one way is called the higgs,</v>

295
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 1>the higgs mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the higgs mechanism involves a</v>

296
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 1>postulating the existence of some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new fields and new kind of matter,</v>

297
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:54.550
<v Speaker 1>which is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this higgs part,</v>

298
00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:55.780
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this higgs field.</v>

299
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:57.003
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

300
00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then giving this,</v>

301
00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.880
<v Speaker 1>that he did the dynamics for the making</v>
<v Speaker 1>the properties of the higgs field such</v>

302
00:13:03.881 --> 00:13:04.840
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

303
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 1>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the vacuum state,</v>

304
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:08.770
<v Speaker 1>the higgs field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have this done trivial property.</v>

305
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.280
<v Speaker 1>So you can do that in some sentence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The higgs field is kind of the simplest</v>

306
00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>way of getting what you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you do it,</v>

307
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 1>you also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

308
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

309
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:23.141
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

310
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you end up losing the ability to predict</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of things.</v>

311
00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause then if some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's the question of why,</v>

312
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.781
<v Speaker 1>why did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does the party,</v>

313
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:32.080
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a certain mass just becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

314
00:13:32.081 --> 00:13:35.350
<v Speaker 1>because that's how strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's how strongly it interacts with the</v>

315
00:13:35.351 --> 00:13:36.970
<v Speaker 1>higgs field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

316
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.390
<v Speaker 1>it's a simplest way of making something</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

317
00:13:40.391 --> 00:13:41.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to happen,</v>

318
00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.813
<v Speaker 1>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

319
00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

320
00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.050
<v Speaker 1>it's a way which has a lot of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really like it,</v>

321
00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:50.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not a very satisfactory way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it because it kind of of</v>

322
00:13:50.471 --> 00:13:52.420
<v Speaker 1>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then it leaves open a whole range of</v>

323
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:54.820
<v Speaker 1>questions and questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you would hope to have answers to,</v>

324
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:57.940
<v Speaker 1>but you just from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't answer it that way.</v>

325
00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.690
<v Speaker 1>So one thing which we hope to learn from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the LHC is,</v>

326
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.860
<v Speaker 1>is this higgs mechanism or does this</v>
<v Speaker 1>higgs field really there?</v>

327
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.223
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

328
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.640
<v Speaker 1>in which case that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll,</v>

329
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:12.250
<v Speaker 1>that'll be actually somewhat of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappointment because it'll mean that,</v>

330
00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this theory kind of continues to work</v>

331
00:14:14.441 --> 00:14:15.790
<v Speaker 1>and we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

332
00:14:15.791 --> 00:14:19.050
<v Speaker 1>we still don't know how to answer some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these questions or I think that the</v>

333
00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:22.330
<v Speaker 1>much more exciting possibility is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be that there's some,</v>

334
00:14:22.331 --> 00:14:25.270
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something else causing this phenomenon</v>

335
00:14:25.271 --> 00:14:28.120
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the vacuum behaving this way.</v>

336
00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

337
00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's something else would be a,</v>

338
00:14:30.971 --> 00:14:31.551
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give us,</v>

339
00:14:31.551 --> 00:14:33.220
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would be,</v>

340
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.050
<v Speaker 1>it would be something which would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>more interesting and we'll,</v>

341
00:14:35.051 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 1>and we'll allow answers to these</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

342
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.120
<v Speaker 1>So instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this whole,</v>

343
00:14:40.121 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this name of the Higgs field and finding</v>

344
00:14:41.681 --> 00:14:43.150
<v Speaker 1>the higgs particle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a,</v>

345
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.090
<v Speaker 1>it's an over simplified way of saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

346
00:14:46.091 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we're really hoping,</v>

347
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:50.230
<v Speaker 1>which is we're really hoping to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand what is causing the vacuum to</v>

348
00:14:50.231 --> 00:14:51.770
<v Speaker 1>behave this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

349
00:14:51.771 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

350
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.420
<v Speaker 1>and we have good reason there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

351
00:14:54.421 --> 00:14:57.650
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of a number in the theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of says how big this</v>

352
00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.320
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon going on in the vacuum is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

353
00:15:00.321 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what the size of it is.</v>

354
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 1>And the size is exactly the size that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

355
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this accelerator should finally be able</v>

356
00:15:06.681 --> 00:15:07.780
<v Speaker 1>to probe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's,</v>

357
00:15:07.781 --> 00:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it's not,</v>

358
00:15:09.171 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very good reason to believe</v>

359
00:15:10.881 --> 00:15:13.790
<v Speaker 1>that this is the right machine to kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of start answering some of these</v>

360
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:14.624
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>

361
00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.000
<v Speaker 1>The real problem is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ways that we knew that there are</v>

362
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.980
<v Speaker 1>various ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have studied a lot of</v>

363
00:15:24.981 --> 00:15:27.260
<v Speaker 1>other alternatives to the Higgs field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm,</v>

364
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.560
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that they're all fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated and none of them,</v>

365
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:34.300
<v Speaker 1>they all have as bad or even worst</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is in that the higgs field,</v>

366
00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.480
<v Speaker 1>they've all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so none of them are convincing.</v>

367
00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 1>We don't have the convincing alternative</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

368
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't either.</v>

369
00:15:40.041 --> 00:15:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the one about all I can say about</v>

370
00:15:43.611 --> 00:15:46.620
<v Speaker 1>that is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there I,</v>

371
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:47.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm very interested in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

372
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.140
<v Speaker 1>in some of the kind of mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the theory that we don't</v>

373
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:54.050
<v Speaker 1>understand and some of the kind of deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematical structure that we don't</v>

374
00:15:54.051 --> 00:15:55.580
<v Speaker 1>understand in our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these theories.</v>

375
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 1>And part of what we don't understand it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in these theories actually is,</v>

376
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is related to this problem of,</v>

377
00:16:02.571 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 1>of the vacuum of this behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the vacuum.</v>

378
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in my ideal world it would turn</v>

379
00:16:10.971 --> 00:16:13.160
<v Speaker 1>out that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

380
00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:15.380
<v Speaker 1>there's something there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something still to be learned</v>

381
00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>about the mathematical structure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these theories,</v>

382
00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.400
<v Speaker 1>which would in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

383
00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:20.930
<v Speaker 1>explain this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this higgs,</v>

384
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.390
<v Speaker 1>this higgs phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is problem with the vacuum.</v>

385
00:16:23.391 --> 00:16:24.440
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I,</v>

386
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:28.090
<v Speaker 1>I wish I knew how to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly don't have a UN has a</v>

387
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.580
<v Speaker 1>very big reasons to believe are there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting thing to look at.</v>

388
00:16:31.581 --> 00:16:32.031
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

389
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I certainly don't have an answer to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think I get,</v>

390
00:16:36.321 --> 00:16:38.060
<v Speaker 1>if I had to assign probabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who had what,</v>

391
00:16:38.061 --> 00:16:41.130
<v Speaker 1>I would a guess is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd say there's about a 50% chance the</v>

392
00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:46.131
<v Speaker 1>lhc will actually see an actual higgs</v>
<v Speaker 1>particle and there will be a,</v>

393
00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.270
<v Speaker 1>there is some kind of higgs field and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is going to be kind of</v>

394
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:53.780
<v Speaker 1>depressing for us because it means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

395
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:55.370
<v Speaker 1>whenever there is this field there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

396
00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:57.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's working like this and the answer</v>

397
00:16:57.861 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would like answers to our,</v>

398
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:05.480
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to go even higher energies or</v>
<v Speaker 1>a smaller distances to understand them.</v>

399
00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's,</v>

400
00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:08.620
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a 50% probability we'll</v>

401
00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:11.720
<v Speaker 1>find that we won't see a higgs particle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least not a higgs particle,</v>

402
00:17:11.721 --> 00:17:12.970
<v Speaker 1>the kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

403
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.030
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you see in the simplest model and,</v>

404
00:17:16.031 --> 00:17:17.840
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that will actually give us clues as</v>

405
00:17:17.841 --> 00:17:20.220
<v Speaker 1>to what's really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that will be much more exciting.</v>

406
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know which is going to</v>

407
00:17:22.431 --> 00:17:23.264
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

408
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:29.840
<v Speaker 1>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's no reason that you,</v>

409
00:17:29.841 --> 00:17:32.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general problem that with particle</v>

410
00:17:32.361 --> 00:17:35.130
<v Speaker 1>physics is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions we're asking are at,</v>

411
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're having such high energy scales</v>

412
00:17:37.731 --> 00:17:42.590
<v Speaker 1>are such short distances that it's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to see how to do anything</v>

413
00:17:42.591 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 1>very practical with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

414
00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>anything like these partners we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>

415
00:17:47.361 --> 00:17:49.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have often have have lifetimes which</v>

416
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:50.394
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

417
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.710
<v Speaker 1>10 to the minus 20 seconds or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're,</v>

418
00:17:52.711 --> 00:17:53.011
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

419
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 1>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you produce a higgs particle,</v>

420
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:59.490
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be so short lived it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's incredibly difficult to even see</v>

421
00:17:59.491 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 1>any evidence of the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not something you'd be able to go</v>

422
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:05.250
<v Speaker 1>out and use these higgs particles to</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry around and do something with it.</v>

423
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.683
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

424
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:07.970
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know what you're going</v>

425
00:18:07.971 --> 00:18:08.340
<v Speaker 1>to find it.</v>

426
00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.470
<v Speaker 1>If you do find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you find something,</v>

427
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I guess I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could say it this way,</v>

428
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 1>if you do just find this higgs particle</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just this higgs field,</v>

429
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:19.710
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to debate to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>really practical with that.</v>

430
00:18:19.711 --> 00:18:21.390
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you find something completely new</v>

431
00:18:21.391 --> 00:18:23.090
<v Speaker 1>understanding of this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then who,</v>

432
00:18:23.091 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can conject clay come up with</v>

433
00:18:25.621 --> 00:18:27.810
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of models.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can come up with models in which</v>

434
00:18:28.410 --> 00:18:31.620
<v Speaker 1>there's kind of new heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>long lived particles which you could</v>

435
00:18:31.621 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 1>then imagine doing things with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

436
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:38.580
<v Speaker 1>I think it is probably a pretty good bet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that within the near future,</v>

437
00:18:38.581 --> 00:18:40.290
<v Speaker 1>this is not really a big way of</v>
<v Speaker 1>practical.</v>

438
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.550
<v Speaker 1>This is really a matter of I'm just</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to understand the world better</v>

439
00:18:43.551 --> 00:18:44.180
<v Speaker 1>and not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

440
00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.480
<v Speaker 1>not as many as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not in a way,</v>

441
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.620
<v Speaker 1>but not in a way that's particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be useful for her for doing</v>

442
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:51.750
<v Speaker 1>anything too practical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to affect people anytime</v>

443
00:18:51.751 --> 00:18:52.584
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

444
00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean some of that is because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the alternatives to this is this</v>

445
00:19:04.831 --> 00:19:08.920
<v Speaker 1>higgs mechanism is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people started studying.</v>

446
00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.850
<v Speaker 1>It sets out some models in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

447
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.710
<v Speaker 1>to go back a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean one thing about string theory and</v>

448
00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:16.980
<v Speaker 1>string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make string theory work,</v>

449
00:19:16.981 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 1>you have to have extra dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have more than a three space</v>

450
00:19:20.101 --> 00:19:23.220
<v Speaker 1>and one time dimensions and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that's kind of an in some sense,</v>

451
00:19:23.221 --> 00:19:28.221
<v Speaker 1>the main problem with it with string</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory that you have to it,</v>

452
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to have at least five extra</v>
<v Speaker 1>dimensions.</v>

453
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:32.731
<v Speaker 1>I start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

454
00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:34.650
<v Speaker 1>six extra dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

455
00:19:34.651 --> 00:19:36.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

456
00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the predictions of the theory and being</v>

457
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:41.490
<v Speaker 1>able to use it for anything depending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,</v>

458
00:19:41.491 --> 00:19:44.490
<v Speaker 1>at least six extra dimensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's no one has ever,</v>

459
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.070
<v Speaker 1>initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hope was that there was a fairly</v>

460
00:19:47.071 --> 00:19:49.920
<v Speaker 1>small number of consistent ways of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with these extra dimensions and</v>

461
00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:50.754
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

462
00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:52.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make this a predictive theory,</v>

463
00:19:52.741 --> 00:19:54.300
<v Speaker 1>but it has turned out they're just too</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

464
00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:58.170
<v Speaker 1>You can do and you can kind of get</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything you want by having these extra</v>

465
00:19:58.171 --> 00:20:00.980
<v Speaker 1>dimensions to different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so one,</v>

466
00:20:00.981 --> 00:20:05.550
<v Speaker 1>one thing as part of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that people studied was models</v>

467
00:20:05.551 --> 00:20:09.610
<v Speaker 1>in which these extra dimensions are</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually of the executive,</v>

468
00:20:09.611 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 1>the right size that the Lhd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should start seeing evidence of</v>

469
00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:17.640
<v Speaker 1>these extra dimensions and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing black holes because it,</v>

470
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>because of these extra dimensions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that say,</v>

471
00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just never really been a reason</v>

472
00:20:21.931 --> 00:20:24.090
<v Speaker 1>to believe that these extra dimensions</v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

473
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.330
<v Speaker 1>we'd see no evidence of them at our best</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerators now.</v>

474
00:20:27.331 --> 00:20:31.740
<v Speaker 1>And we'd go up by a factor of seven and</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy and all of a sudden all these</v>

475
00:20:31.741 --> 00:20:33.210
<v Speaker 1>extra benches would appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

476
00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.520
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's absolutely no reason for that to</v>

477
00:20:35.521 --> 00:20:37.320
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to happen.</v>

478
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:39.330
<v Speaker 1>It's you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can make specked it a model in which</v>

479
00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 1>it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>

480
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.090
<v Speaker 1>then anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's,</v>

481
00:20:42.091 --> 00:20:45.480
<v Speaker 1>there's really kind of no Ma no good</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation for these models and for them</v>

482
00:20:45.481 --> 00:20:47.530
<v Speaker 1>to happen and no evidence for them.</v>

483
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 1>And then even if they were to exist when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did happen,</v>

484
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.410
<v Speaker 1>any such black holes would kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately,</v>

485
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:56.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be kind of completely unstable and</v>

486
00:20:56.361 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just immediately decay into</v>

487
00:20:57.641 --> 00:20:58.810
<v Speaker 1>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you wouldn't,</v>

488
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:02.290
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to produce a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dangerous black hole that way,</v>

489
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:03.101
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

490
00:21:03.101 --> 00:21:04.150
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the first kind of,</v>

491
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:05.800
<v Speaker 1>I think what caused all this trouble is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

492
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.040
<v Speaker 1>people kind of wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

493
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to promote these extra dimensional</v>

494
00:21:10.751 --> 00:21:13.060
<v Speaker 1>models even though there was no good</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation for them.</v>

495
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:15.160
<v Speaker 1>And so they promoted them by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

496
00:21:15.161 --> 00:21:16.510
<v Speaker 1>in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

497
00:21:16.511 --> 00:21:18.790
<v Speaker 1>since we don't know what happens at</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher energies,</v>

498
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:20.440
<v Speaker 1>the Lhc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe evidence,</v>

499
00:21:20.441 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 1>these extra mentions will show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no good reason for that.</v>

500
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:25.180
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once people started promoting the</v>

501
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:26.590
<v Speaker 1>idea of these extra dimensions of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>job,</v>

502
00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:27.850
<v Speaker 1>then people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

503
00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.890
<v Speaker 1>if they show up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then maybe there'll be black holes.</v>

504
00:21:29.891 --> 00:21:33.420
<v Speaker 1>And it was kind of a speculation on top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of speculation on how to speculation.</v>

505
00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.950
<v Speaker 1>But it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all suffered.</v>

506
00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.340
<v Speaker 1>There's has been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no reason to believe that any such</v>

507
00:21:39.341 --> 00:21:40.060
<v Speaker 1>thing could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could,</v>

508
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:40.990
<v Speaker 1>could possibly be true.</v>

509
00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.940
<v Speaker 1>The thing that most fascinates me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole subject is,</v>

510
00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:51.860
<v Speaker 1>is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

511
00:21:51.861 --> 00:21:53.230
<v Speaker 1>that promise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it quickly gets very technical.</v>

512
00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:53.631
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there,</v>

513
00:21:53.631 --> 00:21:55.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some,</v>

514
00:21:55.841 --> 00:21:57.240
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an area of mathematics which is</v>

515
00:21:57.241 --> 00:22:00.850
<v Speaker 1>known as representation theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And from when,</v>

516
00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.430
<v Speaker 1>when I thinking and it's thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is in terms of what are,</v>

517
00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:05.410
<v Speaker 1>what physicists were often called</v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetries.</v>

518
00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.880
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for instance,</v>

519
00:22:06.881 --> 00:22:10.090
<v Speaker 1>one of the basic facts about the laws of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature is that they're,</v>

520
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

521
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.410
<v Speaker 1>they're symmetric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laws of nature are the same at,</v>

522
00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:16.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you move,</v>

523
00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:19.000
<v Speaker 1>if you move in any direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you moving time back and forth?</v>

524
00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.870
<v Speaker 1>The Laws of physics don't change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you rotate things around in three</v>

525
00:22:22.871 --> 00:22:24.790
<v Speaker 1>dimensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the laws of physics don't change.</v>

526
00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:26.460
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

527
00:22:26.461 --> 00:22:30.410
<v Speaker 1>the so called symmetries and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these,</v>

528
00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.320
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cemeteries have very important,</v>

529
00:22:32.321 --> 00:22:34.600
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>physical implications.</v>

530
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.670
<v Speaker 1>So friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the laws of physics don't</v>

531
00:22:36.671 --> 00:22:40.960
<v Speaker 1>change as if you change your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you move in time,</v>

532
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.470
<v Speaker 1>has physical implication that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's this thing called energy</v>

533
00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 1>and energy is conserved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And same thing that and the fact that</v>

534
00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:51.610
<v Speaker 1>laws of physics don't change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you move back and forth in different</v>

535
00:22:51.611 --> 00:22:54.400
<v Speaker 1>directions in space implies that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

536
00:22:54.401 --> 00:22:57.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called momentum and momentum</v>

537
00:22:57.011 --> 00:22:59.340
<v Speaker 1>is conserved and doesn't change and as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you move,</v>

538
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.830
<v Speaker 1>as you evolve in time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

539
00:23:01.831 --> 00:23:04.240
<v Speaker 1>so these very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fundamental facts about physics are</v>

540
00:23:04.241 --> 00:23:07.060
<v Speaker 1>kind of deeply grounded in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetries of,</v>

541
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:11.470
<v Speaker 1>of nature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so to a mathematician,</v>

542
00:23:11.471 --> 00:23:11.831
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

543
00:23:11.831 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 1>this question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

544
00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.500
<v Speaker 1>is a question about what we call about</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups and representations of these</v>

545
00:23:17.501 --> 00:23:20.470
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you go into any math department</v>

546
00:23:20.471 --> 00:23:22.620
<v Speaker 1>and look at what they're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that you know that a lot,</v>

547
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.920
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people and different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics are studying different</v>

548
00:23:26.921 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 1>structures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are all so called groups.</v>

549
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.660
<v Speaker 1>And they're often when studying what are</v>
<v Speaker 1>called representations of these groups.</v>

550
00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So even people setting num number theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of abstract things about,</v>

551
00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.670
<v Speaker 1>about prime numbers or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're also studying groups and certain</v>

552
00:23:39.671 --> 00:23:40.930
<v Speaker 1>representations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these groups.</v>

553
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:45.200
<v Speaker 1>So there's kind of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the extent that mathematics has a</v>

554
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:48.740
<v Speaker 1>kind of a unifying theme and a unifying</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle which shows up in different</v>

555
00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:51.580
<v Speaker 1>areas of mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about this row,</v>

556
00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.380
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these representations and representation</v>

557
00:23:54.381 --> 00:23:58.960
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the thing that most strike when the</v>

558
00:23:58.961 --> 00:24:00.950
<v Speaker 1>most of the things that most strikes me</v>
<v Speaker 1>out physics and was fascinating to me</v>

559
00:24:00.951 --> 00:24:03.110
<v Speaker 1>about it is that if you look at quantum</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanics,</v>

560
00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.860
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics initially it looks</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a very odd structure.</v>

561
00:24:06.861 --> 00:24:09.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that we can,</v>

562
00:24:09.331 --> 00:24:12.440
<v Speaker 1>we have any kind of intuitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding of it doesn't look like,</v>

563
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:14.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

564
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:17.900
<v Speaker 1>like what the way we're used to thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about physics based on everyday</v>

565
00:24:17.901 --> 00:24:18.734
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

566
00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.710
<v Speaker 1>But if you look at the mathematical</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and the basic structures of</v>

567
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:24.740
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're exactly the structures that show</v>

568
00:24:24.741 --> 00:24:27.620
<v Speaker 1>up in this theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this theory of representations.</v>

569
00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:32.630
<v Speaker 1>So there's a kind of a deep</v>
<v Speaker 1>relation between math and physics,</v>

570
00:24:32.631 --> 00:24:36.950
<v Speaker 1>which is surrounding this whole notion</v>
<v Speaker 1>of symmetries and representations of</v>

571
00:24:36.951 --> 00:24:38.410
<v Speaker 1>symmetries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

572
00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:39.830
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's one thing that's always</v>

573
00:24:39.831 --> 00:24:42.980
<v Speaker 1>fascinated me and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and my own research,</v>

574
00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:47.540
<v Speaker 1>my own interest is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in kind of developing t taking a lot</v>

575
00:24:47.541 --> 00:24:49.520
<v Speaker 1>that's been learned in mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot that's been learned in</v>

576
00:24:49.521 --> 00:24:53.510
<v Speaker 1>mathematics over the years about how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about representations and how to</v>

577
00:24:53.511 --> 00:24:55.460
<v Speaker 1>construct them and how to work with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

578
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Some of it has made its way into physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>had been using in physics and,</v>

579
00:24:58.931 --> 00:25:02.810
<v Speaker 1>and was using a physics since the early</v>
<v Speaker 1>days of quantum mechanics.</v>

580
00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:04.003
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

581
00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.410
<v Speaker 1>so for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great kind of to the extent</v>

582
00:25:06.411 --> 00:25:07.660
<v Speaker 1>there is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

583
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.590
<v Speaker 1>a kind of hero of this book I wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>

584
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:12.560
<v Speaker 1>It's a mathematician and called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herrmann vial who was a special,</v>

585
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:16.580
<v Speaker 1>who kind of was one of the first people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand how quantum mechanics work</v>

586
00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:19.400
<v Speaker 1>and to understand the relation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

587
00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:20.721
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

588
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:21.091
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

589
00:25:21.091 --> 00:25:21.741
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there,</v>

590
00:25:21.741 --> 00:25:25.400
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot to be learned and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that way and raised specifically the so</v>

591
00:25:25.401 --> 00:25:28.340
<v Speaker 1>called standard model has this group of</v>
<v Speaker 1>symmetries which is called the gauge</v>

592
00:25:28.341 --> 00:25:33.341
<v Speaker 1>symmetry and it's an influential group</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the standard kind of physics</v>

593
00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.500
<v Speaker 1>conjecture or understanding of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations that this group is that</v>

594
00:25:39.501 --> 00:25:41.900
<v Speaker 1>there is that that should not be an</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting question.</v>

595
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:44.600
<v Speaker 1>There should only be a trivial</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation of this group.</v>

596
00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.810
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my conjecture is that there's,</v>

597
00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.600
<v Speaker 1>there's actually a much more interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>question there.</v>

598
00:25:50.601 --> 00:25:51.410
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

599
00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.950
<v Speaker 1>and pursuing that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pursuing this question of how do you</v>

600
00:25:54.951 --> 00:25:58.280
<v Speaker 1>deal with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the gauge symmetry of this theory</v>

601
00:25:58.281 --> 00:26:01.940
<v Speaker 1>and in terms of using ideas from</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation theory that are,</v>

602
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are more well known in mathematics</v>

603
00:26:04.671 --> 00:26:05.900
<v Speaker 1>that haven't been used in physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

604
00:26:05.901 --> 00:26:09.740
<v Speaker 1>that you can actually get somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's maybe a bit too technical,</v>

605
00:26:09.741 --> 00:26:12.380
<v Speaker 1>but that's about as good as I can do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>

606
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:17.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's hard to say and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

607
00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll get improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

608
00:26:22.550 --> 00:26:27.550
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of the problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with elegant is actually an interesting</v>

609
00:26:28.071 --> 00:26:29.500
<v Speaker 1>a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just say what,</v>

610
00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:31.100
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does elegance and what does it,</v>

611
00:26:31.101 --> 00:26:32.500
<v Speaker 1>what is beauty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so one,</v>

612
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.950
<v Speaker 1>the one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing that's come up even within</v>

613
00:26:33.951 --> 00:26:34.311
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

614
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:35.460
<v Speaker 1>the string theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

615
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.310
<v Speaker 1>issue is this question are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

616
00:26:37.311 --> 00:26:39.680
<v Speaker 1>is this a beautiful idea or a beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory?</v>

617
00:26:39.681 --> 00:26:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my colleague Brian Greene as,</v>

618
00:26:41.961 --> 00:26:42.930
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>irritant,</v>

619
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:44.340
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very good book about this called the</v>

620
00:26:44.341 --> 00:26:46.110
<v Speaker 1>elegant universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>

621
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

622
00:26:48.211 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

623
00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 1>and within,</v>
<v Speaker 1>within,</v>

624
00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.820
<v Speaker 1>within physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is our,</v>

625
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:53.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

626
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:57.630
<v Speaker 1>we're often raise struck by some of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these basic ideas are,</v>

627
00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we would like to our race striking</v>

628
00:27:02.131 --> 00:27:04.660
<v Speaker 1>and that we like to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way which we like to describe as</v>

629
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.030
<v Speaker 1>being elegant are beautiful.</v>

630
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.223
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

631
00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:09.210
<v Speaker 1>the problem with w with those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that terminology,</v>

632
00:27:09.211 --> 00:27:12.210
<v Speaker 1>especially with the terminology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>beauty is that beauty means a lot of</v>

633
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:15.000
<v Speaker 1>different things to a lot of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and a lot of different ways in</v>

634
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:19.410
<v Speaker 1>which things can be beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this really has very specific</v>

635
00:27:19.411 --> 00:27:22.260
<v Speaker 1>meaning and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which is more along the lines of</v>

636
00:27:22.261 --> 00:27:25.410
<v Speaker 1>elegance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that we say that an idea as</v>

637
00:27:25.411 --> 00:27:28.110
<v Speaker 1>beautiful or elegant in mathematics or</v>
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>

638
00:27:28.111 --> 00:27:29.790
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

639
00:27:29.791 --> 00:27:34.590
<v Speaker 1>a very simple principle and raised</v>
<v Speaker 1>simple idea or a simple set of ideas,</v>

640
00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:37.260
<v Speaker 1>it turns out to be very powerful and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

641
00:27:37.290 --> 00:27:40.500
<v Speaker 1>leads to all sorts of unexpected</v>
<v Speaker 1>structure and unexpected predictions.</v>

642
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:41.783
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

643
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.550
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I find is,</v>

644
00:27:45.551 --> 00:27:45.900
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

645
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.140
<v Speaker 1>is the most beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most elegant thing about this whole</v>

646
00:27:49.141 --> 00:27:51.450
<v Speaker 1>subject is a little bit what I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to explain earlier.</v>

647
00:27:51.451 --> 00:27:52.650
<v Speaker 1>If for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea,</v>

648
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe just to say this idea that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

649
00:27:55.370 --> 00:28:00.000
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the laws of physics are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same as you as you move in time</v>

650
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.320
<v Speaker 1>means that has very unexpected and</v>
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>

651
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:06.150
<v Speaker 1>It means that there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this thing called energy and</v>

652
00:28:06.151 --> 00:28:09.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can associate a number of cold</v>

653
00:28:09.211 --> 00:28:12.660
<v Speaker 1>energy to us to institute a physical</v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and it's not going to change it</v>

654
00:28:12.661 --> 00:28:13.494
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you,</v>

655
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:15.390
<v Speaker 1>as time evolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>

656
00:28:15.391 --> 00:28:16.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that,</v>

657
00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:19.260
<v Speaker 1>that's actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

658
00:28:19.330 --> 00:28:19.880
<v Speaker 1>so in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

659
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.450
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in classical physics,</v>

660
00:28:21.451 --> 00:28:22.580
<v Speaker 1>that's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

661
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.600
<v Speaker 1>that's a theorem called an annoyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

662
00:28:24.601 --> 00:28:25.434
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

663
00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:26.363
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

664
00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.920
<v Speaker 1>method one called [inaudible] there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

665
00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:29.991
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

666
00:28:29.991 --> 00:28:32.100
<v Speaker 1>so there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of a slight non</v>

667
00:28:32.101 --> 00:28:33.710
<v Speaker 1>trivial theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amanda,</v>

668
00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.000
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly a,</v>

669
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:37.130
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful theorem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

670
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.110
<v Speaker 1>what fascinates me more is that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>quantum mechanics,</v>

671
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:43.290
<v Speaker 1>northern scenario isn't even a theorem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just kind of,</v>

672
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:46.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just implicit in the definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just the,</v>

673
00:28:46.411 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way you set things up,</v>

674
00:28:48.121 --> 00:28:50.780
<v Speaker 1>it just is automatically true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

675
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:54.470
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

676
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a theorem and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and approve in classical physics and</v>

677
00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:58.340
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

678
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

679
00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.880
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about quantum</v>

680
00:28:59.881 --> 00:29:03.840
<v Speaker 1>mechanics and you think about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it's just kind of automatically</v>

681
00:29:03.841 --> 00:29:05.370
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not even a theorem anymore.</v>

682
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:06.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just beautiful.</v>

683
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

684
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of thing that human beings do</v>

685
00:29:14.471 --> 00:29:18.820
<v Speaker 1>and there's certain politics to it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain economic politics and Polish</v>

686
00:29:18.821 --> 00:29:19.654
<v Speaker 1>with field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

687
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:20.583
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

688
00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:24.720
<v Speaker 1>mathematics is actually a relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthy field these days.</v>

689
00:29:24.721 --> 00:29:25.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are,</v>

690
00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.053
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

691
00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:28.541
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

692
00:29:28.541 --> 00:29:29.430
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are making,</v>

693
00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:31.010
<v Speaker 1>making good progress and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different work,</v>

694
00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:34.450
<v Speaker 1>different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also so,</v>

695
00:29:34.451 --> 00:29:35.250
<v Speaker 1>so anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

696
00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've kind of lived part of my</v>

697
00:29:36.451 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>professional life and mathematics and</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the physics.</v>

698
00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:40.523
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

699
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:43.540
<v Speaker 1>and one thing to say about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mathematics is,</v>

700
00:29:43.541 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a kid can have its problems,</v>

701
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:46.571
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

702
00:29:46.571 --> 00:29:46.981
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

703
00:29:46.981 --> 00:29:51.981
<v Speaker 1>it's actually hasn't seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

704
00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.550
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't seen a lot of the problems of</v>
<v Speaker 1>other sciences and politically,</v>

705
00:29:54.551 --> 00:29:56.170
<v Speaker 1>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly also the</v>

706
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.490
<v Speaker 1>wonderful thing about mathematics is</v>
<v Speaker 1>since so much of it is what people are</v>

707
00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.810
<v Speaker 1>doing is completely useless.</v>

708
00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.670
<v Speaker 1>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm nobody kind of in the outside world</v>

709
00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 1>we're like cares very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't really have,</v>

710
00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't have kind of a right and left</v>
<v Speaker 1>and people getting in,</v>

711
00:30:10.331 --> 00:30:12.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of ideology coming in because there</v>

712
00:30:12.131 --> 00:30:14.920
<v Speaker 1>isn't any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't actually connect up to</v>

713
00:30:14.921 --> 00:30:18.700
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things that people who were</v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about ideologically worry about.</v>

714
00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:21.160
<v Speaker 1>So most of mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it doesn't,</v>

715
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:24.730
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't tell you anything one way or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another about global warming or about,</v>

716
00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health care or about any other number of</v>

717
00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:29.410
<v Speaker 1>things you might care about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

718
00:30:29.411 --> 00:30:33.690
<v Speaker 1>so it's a mathematics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is immune to a lot of exterior pot,</v>

719
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.470
<v Speaker 1>real world politics because of that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the academic politics or it's there.</v>

720
00:30:38.471 --> 00:30:39.304
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

721
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:41.770
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually less than a lot of</v>

722
00:30:41.771 --> 00:30:42.430
<v Speaker 1>fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

723
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:45.520
<v Speaker 1>one of my colleagues likes to say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>mathematics is the,</v>

724
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:50.980
<v Speaker 1>he thinks that about the only subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he knows of it in academia or in</v>

725
00:30:50.981 --> 00:30:53.830
<v Speaker 1>the real world where if two people</v>
<v Speaker 1>disagree about something,</v>

726
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:56.410
<v Speaker 1>if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if people are studying some mathematical</v>

727
00:30:56.411 --> 00:30:57.580
<v Speaker 1>object,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's what you're supposed to be</v>

728
00:30:57.581 --> 00:31:00.970
<v Speaker 1>a proof and they disagree about whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>this proof works or not.</v>

729
00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:02.620
<v Speaker 1>They will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

730
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.730
<v Speaker 1>go into a room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and talk about it and fairly</v>

731
00:31:06.731 --> 00:31:09.010
<v Speaker 1>quickly or at the end of the day one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them will admit they're wrong.</v>

732
00:31:09.610 --> 00:31:10.540
<v Speaker 1>And then he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

733
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:11.820
<v Speaker 1>that the problem a lot of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

734
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 1>this is just doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas mathematics,</v>

735
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:16.090
<v Speaker 1>this is just happens all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the people,</v>

736
00:31:16.091 --> 00:31:19.540
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is this notion of logic and proof</v>

737
00:31:19.541 --> 00:31:22.600
<v Speaker 1>and rigor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we can all allows us to kind of</v>

738
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 1>all stay on one track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physics is,</v>

739
00:31:25.781 --> 00:31:26.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the other thing I'd say that</v>

740
00:31:26.951 --> 00:31:27.521
<v Speaker 1>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

741
00:31:27.521 --> 00:31:30.280
<v Speaker 1>physics is a very complicated subject</v>
<v Speaker 1>with many,</v>

742
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:32.590
<v Speaker 1>many different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A string theory and particle physics or</v>

743
00:31:32.591 --> 00:31:36.160
<v Speaker 1>only a small part of a physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when I talk about physics and I</v>

744
00:31:36.161 --> 00:31:38.320
<v Speaker 1>talked about them and the problems of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those subjects,</v>

745
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:41.260
<v Speaker 1>it's really a problem is of a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>small,</v>

746
00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you know in one discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in one subfield of physics and a lot of</v>

747
00:31:45.851 --> 00:31:48.010
<v Speaker 1>physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are kind of happily going on and</v>

748
00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.190
<v Speaker 1>doing their science and quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully and it has nothing to do</v>

749
00:31:51.191 --> 00:31:54.130
<v Speaker 1>with it and they get very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very annoyed when I hear people going on</v>

750
00:31:54.131 --> 00:31:57.550
<v Speaker 1>about the problems of string theory and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if that's some big problem for</v>

751
00:31:57.551 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 1>physics because it's not their problem.</v>

752
00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.040
<v Speaker 1>String theory in particle physics</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffers.</v>

753
00:32:03.041 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot from the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from this business of being from its own</v>

754
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:08.080
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from not having any,</v>

755
00:32:08.081 --> 00:32:12.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not nobody kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of has it.</v>

756
00:32:12.341 --> 00:32:16.000
<v Speaker 1>Has it been able to come up with any</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good ideas to make positive</v>

757
00:32:16.001 --> 00:32:21.001
<v Speaker 1>progress just because there's been no</v>
<v Speaker 1>experimental evidence to give you a clue</v>

758
00:32:21.491 --> 00:32:24.460
<v Speaker 1>as to which direction to go and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject is,</v>

759
00:32:24.461 --> 00:32:27.770
<v Speaker 1>I think traditionally been very</v>
<v Speaker 1>connected often in,</v>

760
00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.000
<v Speaker 1>in at least from mathematicians point of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view and very faddish way that</v>

761
00:32:31.001 --> 00:32:33.520
<v Speaker 1>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the smart people in the subject.</v>

762
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:35.260
<v Speaker 1>The idea was it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would all kind of jump at the same</v>

763
00:32:35.261 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>problem and I'll try and work in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same problem very often because the,</v>

764
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:42.710
<v Speaker 1>the subject was driven by experiment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

765
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.100
<v Speaker 1>somebody would go out and turn on a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerator like the LSD at higher</v>

766
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:49.280
<v Speaker 1>energy and this is certainly going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen next year if the LHC is see</v>

767
00:32:49.281 --> 00:32:52.010
<v Speaker 1>something unexpected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the whole field is going to</v>

768
00:32:52.011 --> 00:32:54.230
<v Speaker 1>be trying to explain that one thing.</v>

769
00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.970
<v Speaker 1>And so you have a very kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little bit of kind of faddish</v>

770
00:32:58.971 --> 00:33:02.120
<v Speaker 1>sociology that everybody is trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

771
00:33:02.121 --> 00:33:05.360
<v Speaker 1>do the same thing at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or as in other fields like mathematics,</v>

772
00:33:05.361 --> 00:33:08.930
<v Speaker 1>people kind of spread out and develop</v>
<v Speaker 1>expert their expertise and work on</v>

773
00:33:08.931 --> 00:33:13.931
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So part of the problem of the politics</v>

774
00:33:14.091 --> 00:33:19.091
<v Speaker 1>of particle theory and has been that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have people used to the idea that well</v>

775
00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:20.601
<v Speaker 1>you should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

776
00:33:20.601 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 1>look around and see what these smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are working on and I should work</v>

777
00:33:23.391 --> 00:33:25.700
<v Speaker 1>in the same thing as them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you've got,</v>

778
00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.520
<v Speaker 1>you have all these people kind of trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>

779
00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:33.500
<v Speaker 1>And so string theory then got identified</v>
<v Speaker 1>back in 84 as being the hot topic.</v>

780
00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.720
<v Speaker 1>And for a lot of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partly,</v>

781
00:33:35.721 --> 00:33:36.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

782
00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.270
<v Speaker 1>probably cause it was an intriguing</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea,</v>

783
00:33:38.271 --> 00:33:39.790
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but partly also because one of the,</v>

784
00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one of the great geniuses of our</v>

785
00:33:42.261 --> 00:33:44.520
<v Speaker 1>subject that Edward Whitton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a</v>

786
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.350
<v Speaker 1>fantastic genius,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has done these amazing things and you</v>

787
00:33:48.351 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got very interested in it and he</v>

788
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:54.410
<v Speaker 1>started promoting the idea that this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very promising idea.</v>

789
00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And so everyone kind of jumped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped on it.</v>

790
00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:58.843
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

791
00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:00.480
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

792
00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:02.780
<v Speaker 1>and my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my initial reaction at that time,</v>

793
00:34:02.781 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 1>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just getting out of graduate</v>

794
00:34:04.161 --> 00:34:06.520
<v Speaker 1>school at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

795
00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.190
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

796
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.690
<v Speaker 1>partly the way I work and the way I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think I,</v>

797
00:34:09.691 --> 00:34:11.600
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't so interested.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of trying to do it at the same</v>

798
00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:14.540
<v Speaker 1>thing as everybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would prefer to work on something a</v>

799
00:34:14.541 --> 00:34:16.610
<v Speaker 1>bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And partly also,</v>

800
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:19.150
<v Speaker 1>it didn't seem to me that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

801
00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:20.870
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that this was obviously a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

802
00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:22.550
<v Speaker 1>It might be a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might not,</v>

803
00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were obvious problems with it</v>

804
00:34:23.901 --> 00:34:27.810
<v Speaker 1>from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

805
00:34:27.811 --> 00:34:31.340
<v Speaker 1>so starting in [inaudible] 84,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody started working on this and I</v>

806
00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.930
<v Speaker 1>think my reaction to it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

807
00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great that they're doing this and</v>

808
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.380
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen is what normally</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in the subject is that after six</v>

809
00:34:39.381 --> 00:34:42.860
<v Speaker 1>months or a year or two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people will see whether it's a good idea</v>

810
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:44.880
<v Speaker 1>or not and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

811
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:46.260
<v Speaker 1>and if it's not a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll,</v>

812
00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:46.970
<v Speaker 1>they'll move on.</v>

813
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:51.650
<v Speaker 1>And the really peculiar thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>happened here was that,</v>

814
00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:53.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 years later,</v>

815
00:34:53.181 --> 00:34:55.090
<v Speaker 1>this is still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

816
00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot of people doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

817
00:34:56.901 --> 00:34:57.171
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

818
00:34:57.171 --> 00:34:57.441
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

819
00:34:57.441 --> 00:35:01.270
<v Speaker 1>it really kind of caught fire and even</v>
<v Speaker 1>without succeeding it,</v>

820
00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:04.010
<v Speaker 1>it's still kind of developed into this</v>
<v Speaker 1>hole,</v>

821
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.260
<v Speaker 1>into this huge subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

822
00:35:06.261 --> 00:35:08.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it kind of in some sense kind of</v>

823
00:35:08.271 --> 00:35:11.270
<v Speaker 1>achieves some kind of critical mass and</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more people were working on it</v>

824
00:35:11.271 --> 00:35:15.050
<v Speaker 1>and they're working on it for so long</v>
<v Speaker 1>that people ended up kind of devoting</v>

825
00:35:15.051 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 1>their careers to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very,</v>

826
00:35:17.061 --> 00:35:18.950
<v Speaker 1>very difficult and a very complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>

827
00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

828
00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:24.050
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires quite a lot of time just to</v>

829
00:35:24.051 --> 00:35:26.060
<v Speaker 1>even get to the point of understanding</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>

830
00:35:26.061 --> 00:35:30.440
<v Speaker 1>So you had lots of want more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>people working on this for investing</v>

831
00:35:30.441 --> 00:35:34.130
<v Speaker 1>more and more of their time and their</v>
<v Speaker 1>careers and their lives and it,</v>

832
00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it really got to the</v>

833
00:35:36.741 --> 00:35:40.650
<v Speaker 1>unfortunate that people were kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unwilling to kind of admit that this</v>

834
00:35:40.651 --> 00:35:44.880
<v Speaker 1>wasn't working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's a natural human reaction to an</v>

835
00:35:44.881 --> 00:35:46.860
<v Speaker 1>idea of your fond of that you put a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it to,</v>

836
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:50.250
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard to get to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get you to admit often wellmade this</v>

837
00:35:50.251 --> 00:35:51.570
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

838
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:53.700
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was kind of happening very much</v>

839
00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 1>in spades in this story I think has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard to get people to kind of admit</v>

840
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:58.890
<v Speaker 1>that this is something that hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out.</v>

841
00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:08.630
<v Speaker 1>There's actually kind of two that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of two things.</v>

842
00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:10.620
<v Speaker 1>What does the blog else I wrote wrote</v>
<v Speaker 1>this book.</v>

843
00:36:10.621 --> 00:36:11.910
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

844
00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:13.460
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

845
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:13.820
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

846
00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:17.310
<v Speaker 1>for many years I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't very happy with what was going</v>

847
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:18.930
<v Speaker 1>on there and I was kind of observing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kay,</v>

848
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 1>this is becoming more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>problematic.</v>

849
00:36:20.971 --> 00:36:23.530
<v Speaker 1>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

850
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.430
<v Speaker 1>not only are our people kind of not</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitting that this isn't working out,</v>

851
00:36:26.431 --> 00:36:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

852
00:36:27.331 --> 00:36:29.430
<v Speaker 1>there's this whole that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

853
00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.950
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of kind of public</v>
<v Speaker 1>promotion of the subject and,</v>

854
00:36:31.951 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very difficult,</v>

855
00:36:33.541 --> 00:36:35.460
<v Speaker 1>complicated ethnography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't or don't</v>

856
00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:37.500
<v Speaker 1>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>

857
00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:40.620
<v Speaker 1>this is really not a healthy situation</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that someone should kind of,</v>

858
00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:44.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and kind of clearly explained to larger</v>

859
00:36:44.551 --> 00:36:45.730
<v Speaker 1>community of physicists and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

860
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.050
<v Speaker 1>and also at the non physicists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

861
00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:48.660
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what the situation is</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

862
00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.493
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

863
00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:52.020
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote an article about this and then I</v>

864
00:36:52.021 --> 00:36:54.390
<v Speaker 1>finally wrote this book and it took,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it took,</v>

865
00:36:54.930 --> 00:36:56.160
<v Speaker 1>it took a while to get the book</v>
<v Speaker 1>publishers.</v>

866
00:36:56.161 --> 00:36:58.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a long and interesting story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

867
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.680
<v Speaker 1>but then while after,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it's after,</v>

868
00:37:01.681 --> 00:37:04.130
<v Speaker 1>after the book was written,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also started a,</v>

869
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.150
<v Speaker 1>started to see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple of other physicists</v>

870
00:37:06.151 --> 00:37:07.590
<v Speaker 1>would started blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

871
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:10.140
<v Speaker 1>well this is an interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting thing to try to do.</v>

872
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And I can both talk about his issues</v>
<v Speaker 1>related to string theory and things,</v>

873
00:37:14.401 --> 00:37:18.070
<v Speaker 1>which I was trying to get out through</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book but also kind of follow it and</v>

874
00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:21.900
<v Speaker 1>on a day to day basis and also just kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of write about whatever I'm interested</v>

875
00:37:21.901 --> 00:37:22.920
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the um,</v>

876
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:24.591
<v Speaker 1>the blog,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

877
00:37:24.591 --> 00:37:28.040
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't worry a lot about who</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the,</v>

878
00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:29.220
<v Speaker 1>about the audience for it.</v>

879
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:32.100
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of written things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I realize it's very much,</v>

880
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:36.090
<v Speaker 1>it's really just kind of whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever I would like to read.</v>

881
00:37:36.091 --> 00:37:37.800
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of writing whenever I would</v>

882
00:37:37.801 --> 00:37:40.350
<v Speaker 1>like to read stuff to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's somebody out there exactly</v>

883
00:37:40.351 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 1>like me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they much find is really fascinating and</v>

884
00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:45.270
<v Speaker 1>if there's something quite different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find it not at all interesting.</v>

885
00:37:45.550 --> 00:37:47.190
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of that it's um,</v>

886
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.040
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of things in the blog are</v>
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>

887
00:37:50.041 --> 00:37:50.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

888
00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:53.160
<v Speaker 1>if I learned something or something new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting going on and even in pure</v>

889
00:37:53.161 --> 00:37:56.340
<v Speaker 1>mathematics I'll be writing about that</v>
<v Speaker 1>or pretty much anything going on in</v>

890
00:37:56.341 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 1>between mathematics and physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're writing about that,</v>

891
00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.100
<v Speaker 1>writing a lot about the LHC and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also just about whatever is going on</v>

892
00:38:05.251 --> 00:38:07.230
<v Speaker 1>in this controversy over string theory</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had done,</v>

893
00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:11.820
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that more kind of keeps</v>

894
00:38:11.821 --> 00:38:14.340
<v Speaker 1>happening without this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my book came out and there was at the</v>

895
00:38:14.341 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 1>same time there's a book by another</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicist,</v>

896
00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:18.510
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a similar point of view to mind and</v>

897
00:38:18.511 --> 00:38:21.440
<v Speaker 1>all came to that came out with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes a lot of controversies with</v>

898
00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:25.020
<v Speaker 1>a lot of reviews and a lot of argument</v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in these blogs.</v>

899
00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.840
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people refer to this as the</v>
<v Speaker 1>string wars.</v>

900
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:29.460
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this very,</v>

901
00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:35.140
<v Speaker 1>for for a year or two there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a kind of a right,</v>

902
00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're interested,</v>

903
00:38:36.221 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an interesting warfare in terms</v>

904
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:41.590
<v Speaker 1>of blog postings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And comments going on on my site and</v>

905
00:38:41.591 --> 00:38:44.200
<v Speaker 1>grey as others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was all sort of with,</v>

906
00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.820
<v Speaker 1>that would lead to all sorts of strange</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

907
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I mean I,</v>

908
00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.380
<v Speaker 1>it depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I often learn interesting things from</v>

909
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.521
<v Speaker 1>comment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

910
00:38:55.521 --> 00:38:57.320
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now that the blog is fairly well</v>

911
00:38:57.321 --> 00:38:59.880
<v Speaker 1>known,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people will write in comments and</v>

912
00:38:59.881 --> 00:39:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I've logged off and telling me about</v>
<v Speaker 1>something I hadn't heard about her new</v>

913
00:39:02.661 --> 00:39:04.910
<v Speaker 1>button you don't know about and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's very interesting order.</v>

914
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.770
<v Speaker 1>They'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll often send it to me privately by</v>

915
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:08.600
<v Speaker 1>email saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

916
00:39:08.601 --> 00:39:11.040
<v Speaker 1>you might be interested in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I get a lot of that.</v>

917
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lot that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

918
00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:16.700
<v Speaker 1>or what interesting thing I thought I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>using about the whole string theory</v>

919
00:39:16.701 --> 00:39:18.980
<v Speaker 1>thing discussion was that it say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

920
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:24.560
<v Speaker 1>it really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredibly complex and difficult</v>

921
00:39:24.561 --> 00:39:29.120
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so it's really hard to over</v>

922
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:33.470
<v Speaker 1>emphasize how it's a subject that really</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody understands very well.</v>

923
00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:36.070
<v Speaker 1>And even the people who are the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>experts at it are.</v>

924
00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:40.580
<v Speaker 1>And it's amazing experience of having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation with some Nobel prize</v>

925
00:39:40.581 --> 00:39:42.440
<v Speaker 1>winners who people are thought of as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

926
00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.140
<v Speaker 1>the brightest people in this field and</v>
<v Speaker 1>asking them what they think of the</v>

927
00:39:45.141 --> 00:39:46.980
<v Speaker 1>string theory and they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

928
00:39:46.990 --> 00:39:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't really understand what's going</v>

929
00:39:48.651 --> 00:39:49.880
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to comment on it.</v>

930
00:39:49.881 --> 00:39:52.100
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm baffled by it.</v>

931
00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.330
<v Speaker 1>So one interesting thing about the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these discussions and the blog</v>

932
00:39:56.331 --> 00:40:01.331
<v Speaker 1>was I found one way to have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out exactly what's going on in,</v>

933
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.850
<v Speaker 1>in string theory and whether,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

934
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:08.720
<v Speaker 1>if something is really a problem or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>not is to just put up my understanding</v>

935
00:40:08.721 --> 00:40:09.830
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

936
00:40:09.831 --> 00:40:11.690
<v Speaker 1>in a blog posting or in a comment or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

937
00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And then fairly quickly you would find</v>
<v Speaker 1>that either,</v>

938
00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either I was wrong and there,</v>

939
00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:19.490
<v Speaker 1>there was some reason that this actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>made sense even though I thought it</v>

940
00:40:19.491 --> 00:40:20.810
<v Speaker 1>didn't and this would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

941
00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.310
<v Speaker 1>I would quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often abusive Leebee explained to me</v>

942
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:25.790
<v Speaker 1>what an idiot I was and why this was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

943
00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:27.020
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the answer,</v>

944
00:40:27.021 --> 00:40:31.370
<v Speaker 1>what you really should have known or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then I found out that,</v>

945
00:40:31.371 --> 00:40:32.360
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned something.</v>

946
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

947
00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.770
<v Speaker 1>or often I would found out that if I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing,</v>

948
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.970
<v Speaker 1>if there really was a problem here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer I would get would often be</v>

949
00:40:37.971 --> 00:40:39.320
<v Speaker 1>just this abuse of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

950
00:40:39.321 --> 00:40:41.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a complete jerk and you're a</v>

951
00:40:41.211 --> 00:40:42.050
<v Speaker 1>moron and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

952
00:40:42.051 --> 00:40:43.950
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

953
00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.740
<v Speaker 1>no scientific answer to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

954
00:40:45.741 --> 00:40:47.120
<v Speaker 1>to the scientific question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

955
00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:48.650
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was one that was actually an</v>

956
00:40:48.651 --> 00:40:51.740
<v Speaker 1>interesting way to kind of see exactly</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the state of research and the</v>

957
00:40:51.741 --> 00:40:56.741
<v Speaker 1>subject was by kind of probing it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to an egg and getting that kind</v>

958
00:40:57.051 --> 00:41:00.770
<v Speaker 1>of response from some of the more</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile people in the subject.</v>

959
00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.213
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

960
00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:09.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

961
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.580
<v Speaker 1>it's mostly a positive thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

962
00:41:11.581 --> 00:41:13.890
<v Speaker 1>one thing to say about the w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main problems with,</v>

963
00:41:13.891 --> 00:41:15.440
<v Speaker 1>with the blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most annoying thing about the</v>

964
00:41:15.441 --> 00:41:17.030
<v Speaker 1>logs is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if,</v>

965
00:41:17.031 --> 00:41:17.560
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a,</v>

966
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.090
<v Speaker 1>if a lot of people are reading it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really in a situation where</v>

967
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.610
<v Speaker 1>there's a small number of people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>really understand this and know what's</v>

968
00:41:23.611 --> 00:41:26.130
<v Speaker 1>going on and have something really</v>
<v Speaker 1>sensible to say about it.</v>

969
00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:30.510
<v Speaker 1>There's a very large number of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have some kind of interest in it and</v>

970
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have the time and energy to sit there</v>

971
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.920
<v Speaker 1>and write uninformed things on your blog</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

972
00:41:36.110 --> 00:41:38.840
<v Speaker 1>and kind of just so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I actually did,</v>

973
00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:42.650
<v Speaker 1>I think I'd like some logs actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>delete a lot of the comments submitted</v>

974
00:41:42.651 --> 00:41:45.500
<v Speaker 1>to my blog and try to keep the noise</v>
<v Speaker 1>level down.</v>

975
00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:46.390
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

976
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.121
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

977
00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:49.010
<v Speaker 1>so that's the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the most discouraging thing</v>

978
00:41:49.011 --> 00:41:52.970
<v Speaker 1>about the whole experience is just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people out there who kind</v>

979
00:41:52.971 --> 00:41:55.070
<v Speaker 1>of want to go on about this and argue</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this but don't know what they're</v>

980
00:41:55.071 --> 00:41:59.990
<v Speaker 1>talking about and want to kind of fill</v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet and all information sources</v>

981
00:41:59.991 --> 00:42:03.050
<v Speaker 1>they get their hands on with kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>uninformed nonsense.</v>

982
00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.850
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

983
00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

984
00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just the kind of discussion of the</v>

985
00:42:09.141 --> 00:42:12.320
<v Speaker 1>other subject and have its problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I think went on in these blogs and</v>

986
00:42:12.321 --> 00:42:13.490
<v Speaker 1>which are in which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

987
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:16.520
<v Speaker 1>if you're interested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can now have an going to go and see</v>

988
00:42:16.521 --> 00:42:18.290
<v Speaker 1>and read.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's really any other</v>

989
00:42:18.291 --> 00:42:19.070
<v Speaker 1>form of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

990
00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.250
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing format for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's really no other way that,</v>

991
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that discussion could,</v>

992
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:26.270
<v Speaker 1>it could be held in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

993
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

994
00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:27.831
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

995
00:42:27.831 --> 00:42:29.240
<v Speaker 1>and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Internet just provides us</v>

996
00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 1>amazing access to the information of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort,</v>

997
00:42:33.711 --> 00:42:36.050
<v Speaker 1>which is just totally unlike anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had before.</v>

998
00:42:36.051 --> 00:42:41.000
<v Speaker 1>You can just google some term and</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately have access to all sorts of</v>

999
00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:44.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often high level discussions of the</v>

1000
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.060
<v Speaker 1>subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

1001
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I think the one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's actually made some of the um,</v>

1002
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:57.710
<v Speaker 1>faddishness of particle theory actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit worse in the sense that one thing</v>

1003
00:42:58.401 --> 00:43:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that used to kind of slow down and fads</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just the,</v>

1004
00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:03.320
<v Speaker 1>how long it took to communicate them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1005
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.861
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1006
00:43:03.861 --> 00:43:07.760
<v Speaker 1>the certain prominent people might have</v>
<v Speaker 1>started working on some idea at</v>

1007
00:43:07.761 --> 00:43:11.300
<v Speaker 1>Princeton or Harvard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would take a while for that news</v>

1008
00:43:11.301 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 1>of that and understanding of what these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were doing to filter out to the</v>

1009
00:43:14.511 --> 00:43:17.420
<v Speaker 1>rest of the community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if people want it to kind of jump on</v>

1010
00:43:17.421 --> 00:43:19.940
<v Speaker 1>it and pursue it in a faddish way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would take them while to even find</v>

1011
00:43:19.941 --> 00:43:23.140
<v Speaker 1>out about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas now everybody's kind of,</v>

1012
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.990
<v Speaker 1>every night there's a new set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>preprints coming out in the pre print</v>

1013
00:43:26.991 --> 00:43:29.220
<v Speaker 1>server and people logging in and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at these.</v>

1014
00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And the minute that somebody has some</v>
<v Speaker 1>new thing,</v>

1015
00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:34.760
<v Speaker 1>which is becoming a kind of faddish</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to work on,</v>

1016
00:43:34.761 --> 00:43:39.200
<v Speaker 1>everybody throughout the world has it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same time when their desktop</v>

1017
00:43:39.201 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 1>and can start thinking about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on it.</v>

1018
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:44.390
<v Speaker 1>And so it kind of makes that even more</v>
<v Speaker 1>so than it used to be.</v>

1019
00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:50.580
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
