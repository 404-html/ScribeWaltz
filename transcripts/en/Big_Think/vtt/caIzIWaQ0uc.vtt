00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>You have a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2
00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:16.291
<v Speaker 1>of success stories in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Africa in the last 15 to 20 years.</v>

3
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.250
<v Speaker 1>A country like Ghana has a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial growth rates.</v>

4
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some countries in,</v>

5
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.451
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

6
00:00:23.451 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>in cells in Africa who are also doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite well in Asia.</v>

7
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>I was in Bangladesh for a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago and that's the country facing</v>

8
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>enormous challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.290
<v Speaker 1>but there's 150 million people living in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country,</v>

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.970
<v Speaker 1>something twice the size of Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the appropriate level</v>

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>of state and the United States is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

12
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.650
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small piece of land and,</v>

13
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:47.221
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:47.221 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>they've been growing against all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>odds and surviving.</v>

15
00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>There's still huge poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still making some progress.</v>

16
00:00:53.731 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as are some other cases in,</v>

17
00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>particularly in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places like Cambodia who have came out</v>

18
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>of a dreadful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a internal conflict 30,</v>

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>30 odd years ago and have made a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>

20
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So I think the foundation stones have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be good governance.</v>

21
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.690
<v Speaker 1>I think countries have to invest in</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

22
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

23
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set and get,</v>

24
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.130
<v Speaker 1>find some way of partnership between</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments and civil society and</v>

25
00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 1>governments I think have to be willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give the space to civil society to</v>

26
00:01:27.781 --> 00:01:32.781
<v Speaker 1>enable them to make the cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>contribution and enable at over time</v>

27
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:37.890
<v Speaker 1>institutional development for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental and nongovernmental level</v>

28
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.220
<v Speaker 1>to develop an,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.780
<v Speaker 1>and that is ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what needs to be done in,</v>

30
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.614
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

31
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a country.</v>

32
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>And obviously good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well grounded policy policy is</v>

33
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:51.691
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>policy that we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.300
<v Speaker 1>we'll put attend if in a country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

36
00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has a big proportion of its economy</v>

37
00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>dealing in agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be a,</v>

38
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>do focus on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think the food crisis earlier this</v>

40
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 1>year brought it home to people that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 20 to 30 years,</v>

41
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:18.630
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and rural development as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector has largely been neglected.</v>

42
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>And there is a daunting at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>

43
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>on leaders both at national and</v>
<v Speaker 1>international level,</v>

44
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.940
<v Speaker 1>that that has to change.</v>
