1
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.600
<v Speaker 1>If there is a single force as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>biologist,</v>

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.880
<v Speaker 1>I would have to begin with the force of</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly,</v>

4
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe in evolution.</v>

5
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the theory of natural selection.</v>

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:23.430
<v Speaker 1>I think it's had an enormous impact on</v>
<v Speaker 1>who we are as a species and where we are</v>

7
00:00:23.431 --> 00:00:25.340
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I believe in the power of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think particularly if you look at the</v>

9
00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:38.331
<v Speaker 1>history of human endeavor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could write that history based on</v>

10
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of technological advances we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know from the bronze age on the first</v>

11
00:00:46.261 --> 00:00:49.590
<v Speaker 1>time someone picked up a stick and</v>
<v Speaker 1>realized it could be a tool,</v>

12
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to what is happening today in,</v>

13
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.500
<v Speaker 1>with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

14
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>I think that has been a tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

15
00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has affected the way we have</v>

17
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>developed as a species.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I think the other would be the move away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from subsistence to creating excess,</v>

19
00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>which is another way of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>the ability to move from living hand to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth to find the leak creating wealth</v>

21
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>than what wealth allowed individuals to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

22
00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both in terms of creating a greater</v>

23
00:01:30.571 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>comfort in the way we live.</v>

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>But I think also in allowing us to</v>
<v Speaker 1>leisure time that allows us as humans to</v>

25
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:40.680
<v Speaker 1>create art,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

26
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I think the great force in higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>education in the United States has been</v>

27
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is really been several things actually,</v>

28
00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:56.090
<v Speaker 1>now that I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first I think was the commitment</v>

29
00:01:56.091 --> 00:02:01.091
<v Speaker 1>really from the very beginning of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country to free public education.</v>

30
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I think was a revolutionary idea in</v>

31
00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>some respects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it is one that has served</v>

32
00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>the country very well until relatively</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent times.</v>

33
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 1>And I think if I have one concern about</v>
<v Speaker 1>how that is now playing out today in</v>

34
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>2007,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I worry about the enormous difference in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of the very best and the</v>

36
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>very worst of our public schools in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

37
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap between what happens in</v>

38
00:02:33.741 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Princeton high school and what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the high schools in Trenton,</v>

39
00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 1>which are just 20 miles away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are night and day.</v>

40
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.620
<v Speaker 1>And I worry about the degree to which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are striving for free public education</v>

41
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>has really been diminished in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

42
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the same thing could be true</v>

43
00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:01.070
<v Speaker 1>about great state universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

44
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>they were created a so that at every</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual capable of doing work at the</v>

45
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>university level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have an opportunity to go to</v>

46
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>college.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

47
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 1>as those state colleges and universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>are being financially squeezed by their</v>

48
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>state legislatures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have only one choice and that is to</v>

49
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 1>raise tuition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as they've raised tuition,</v>

50
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 1>those state colleges and universities</v>
<v Speaker 1>become less and less accessible to those</v>

51
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>who are in the bottom of the income</v>
<v Speaker 1>bracket.</v>
