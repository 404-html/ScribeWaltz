1
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>I was born in Russia and came over when</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was very little.</v>

2
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I was six and a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I grew up outside of Boston.</v>

3
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>My parents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first they lived in Brighton,</v>

4
00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.740
<v Speaker 1>which is where the Russians start out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they gradually moved west.</v>

5
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>They moved to Brookline and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to Newton and that's where they</v>

6
00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now some people,</v>

7
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:34.490
<v Speaker 1>they move out to Lincoln and conquered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.390
<v Speaker 1>where they're not very many Russians at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

9
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 1>But in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.800
<v Speaker 1>in Newton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are a few Russians.</v>

11
00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.860
<v Speaker 1>So I'm partly from Moscow and I'm partly</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Newton.</v>

12
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

13
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>those things have shaped me and complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>and confusing ways.</v>

14
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>If my parents were from a particular</v>
<v Speaker 1>millia in,</v>

15
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.940
<v Speaker 1>in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a particular intellectual,</v>

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.650
<v Speaker 1>social millia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom was a literary critic and,</v>

17
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.820
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they came to Newton,</v>

18
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they sort of managed to</v>

19
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.040
<v Speaker 1>reconstruct that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

20
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>with the other Russians that were there.</v>

21
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was cut off.</v>

22
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It was a world that they were cut off</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the American world that surrounded</v>

23
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.980
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was sort of island of a Russian,</v>

24
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>a computer programmers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals,</v>

25
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a prosperous American suburb.</v>

26
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and for me that was,</v>

27
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was confusing because I very much</v>

28
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be an American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to,</v>

29
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fit in with the rest of the kids.</v>

30
00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:52.300
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

31
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to engage with American life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

32
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to sit at home with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>parents and the Russian books and</v>

33
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.300
<v Speaker 1>drinking tea all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.690
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

35
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I knew I could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sensed,</v>

36
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>even though I didn't acknowledge until a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit later,</v>

37
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 1>my parents were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very rich world.</v>

39
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I didn't really understand it very</v>

40
00:02:17.621 --> 00:02:21.820
<v Speaker 1>well until I started going back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia when I was in my early twenties,</v>

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seeing the world that they'd come</v>

42
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>from and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and understanding what their place in</v>

43
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 1>that world had been.</v>

44
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.520
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's been</v>

45
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>something that I have been sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>working and thinking about,</v>

46
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>

47
00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:38.590
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

48
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>and this book is really the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that I've actually,</v>

49
00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really started getting added.</v>

50
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.870
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the book is,</v>

51
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.660
<v Speaker 1>it's not about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not about Russian immigrants by any</v>

52
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:50.494
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

53
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

54
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.050
<v Speaker 1>the problem of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of being a person who,</v>

55
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.400
<v Speaker 1>who has a lot of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

56
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes a culture that's filled with</v>

57
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:01.840
<v Speaker 1>ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>and is confronted with an American</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that is not particularly</v>

59
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>interested in ideas at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my parents growing up,</v>

60
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>there was just no context for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

61
00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>they were these strange people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

62
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>living on woodcliff road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in our little house.</v>

64
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when I was going to Moscow in</v>

65
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the 90s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a whole world of people just</v>

66
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>like my parents.</v>

67
00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

68
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just put them into a context that I</v>

69
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:37.831
<v Speaker 1>could understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me with regard to this stuff,</v>

70
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 1>a very important experience was toward</v>
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

71
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toward the end of my senior year when I</v>

72
00:03:46.841 --> 00:03:48.430
<v Speaker 1>was working on my thesis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

73
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a major,</v>

74
00:03:51.881 --> 00:03:55.090
<v Speaker 1>my major was Russia and America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I ended up writing on a ts Elliot,</v>

75
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.210
<v Speaker 1>who is neither really even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even very American.</v>

76
00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had spent a lot of time in England,</v>

77
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the,</v>

78
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the groups of people that,</v>

79
00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:10.240
<v Speaker 1>that Elliot meant the most to in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>states where these people are on the</v>

80
00:04:10.241 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>partisan review.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

81
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.031
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

82
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:14.950
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't really known about these people</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

83
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

84
00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't really part of the college</v>

85
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:21.250
<v Speaker 1>curriculum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

86
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

87
00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>and I discovered these people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically were first generation</v>

88
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.440
<v Speaker 1>immigrants from Russia.</v>

89
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a Philip Rov,</v>

90
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:34.560
<v Speaker 1>the editor of the partisan review was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually Ivan Greenberg.</v>

91
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.170
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

92
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>he was born in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came over when he was little,</v>

93
00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saul bellow as born in Petersburg.</v>

94
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

95
00:04:43.451 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>and his parents left when he was still a</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby.</v>

96
00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.800
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so these people who are all been</v>

97
00:04:50.801 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>born around 1920,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

98
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>so they were the age of my grandparents</v>
<v Speaker 1>had actually had very similar</v>

99
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:59.680
<v Speaker 1>experiences to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

100
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>in a way where they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>their parents were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

102
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.610
<v Speaker 1>were foreigners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't speak English very well.</v>

103
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet they very much wanted to be part</v>

104
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>of a American intellectual life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So discovering those people and feeling</v>

105
00:05:14.201 --> 00:05:14.861
<v Speaker 1>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

106
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.220
<v Speaker 1>I had a very similar experience to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and that they were,</v>

107
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a much more experience that was much</v>

108
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 1>more like mine than,</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that of my contemporaries that of</v>

109
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:27.760
<v Speaker 1>my American Jewish contemporaries.</v>

110
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a very,</v>

111
00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>important experience for me.</v>

112
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.590
<v Speaker 1>And that has allowed me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

113
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I think develop a way of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of writing about Russia and thinking</v>

114
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>about Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this place that I had</v>

115
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.920
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that had been very important to me</v>

116
00:05:44.921 --> 00:05:48.540
<v Speaker 1>and certainly to my reading development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

117
00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>or writing about it in America because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what these people had done.</v>

118
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>And they were all still very interested</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Russia and the Soviet Union.</v>

119
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were,</v>

120
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.280
<v Speaker 1>they were using these things to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand American life.</v>

121
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.451
