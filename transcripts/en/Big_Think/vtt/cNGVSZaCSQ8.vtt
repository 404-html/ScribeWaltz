1
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess the most commendable thing he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>done is,</v>

2
00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not decide the bomb he ran or something.</v>

3
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.010
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm things he hasn't done that</v>

4
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:22.810
<v Speaker 1>it's commendable that he hasn't done</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

5
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:23.644
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>he can point to very little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least by my standards,</v>

7
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>just commendable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>he's retracted some of the more extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>Bush positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

10
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:38.260
<v Speaker 1>say on Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.550
<v Speaker 1>Bush imposed condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the normal conditions are totally</v>

12
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>outlandish and ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is why everyone except Israel</v>

13
00:00:46.961 --> 00:00:51.190
<v Speaker 1>votes against them at the UN and why the</v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of Americans subject to them.</v>

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>But the Bush went way beyond the and</v>
<v Speaker 1>post even harsher conditions and uh,</v>

15
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama with through some of those,</v>

16
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

17
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear issues,</v>

18
00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>he has indicated that the u s should</v>
<v Speaker 1>return to the main stream of</v>

19
00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>international affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assign.</v>

20
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.950
<v Speaker 1>They consider again the Comprehensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>Test Ban Treaty move towards reducing</v>

21
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>That's a step forward from bushes</v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

23
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's a step towards the center and</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the international main stream</v>

24
00:01:28.541 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 1>and also towards the American public</v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion.</v>

25
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a number of other cases like</v>

26
00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:36.430
<v Speaker 1>that where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bush administration,</v>

27
00:01:36.431 --> 00:01:39.460
<v Speaker 1>especially its first term was quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme,</v>

28
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 1>which is why a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s standing in the world fell to</v>

29
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>historic lows.</v>

30
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Nothing much because I never expected</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

31
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I th I was a little surprised by the</v>

32
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>fact that he re-instituted uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

33
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

34
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 1>judicial practices that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were kind of</v>

36
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.710
<v Speaker 1>unconscionable that Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.230
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

38
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 1>made use of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

39
00:02:15.421 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>he wants preventative detention</v>
<v Speaker 1>permanently.</v>

40
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>he's been waffling about torture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

42
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 1>refusing to grant a normal criminal</v>
<v Speaker 1>trials to people that they have no</v>

43
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>evidence against a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they claim to have none.</v>

44
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that have been a little</v>

45
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:40.080
<v Speaker 1>surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he had to be that extreme.</v>

46
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:40.914
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

47
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his,</v>

48
00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of actually deviation</v>

49
00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>from any reasonable legal stuff.</v>
