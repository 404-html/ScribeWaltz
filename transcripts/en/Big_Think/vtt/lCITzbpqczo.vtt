00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't call it open.</v>

2
00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I close friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4
00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>she's been really helpful to me and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have so much respect for her.</v>

5
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had the opportunity to spend time</v>

6
00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:24.521
<v Speaker 1>with her a few times and I think she's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most amazing individuals in</v>

7
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:26.780
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Truly.</v>

8
00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's done so much good for the world</v>

9
00:00:28.911 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>and she's been so successful and she</v>
<v Speaker 1>represents herself and,</v>

10
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:34.820
<v Speaker 1>and frankly she represents black people</v>
<v Speaker 1>really well,</v>

11
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:35.683
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

12
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's someone that we are really proud</v>

13
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:43.121
<v Speaker 1>of and I'm proud to be associated with</v>
<v Speaker 1>our.</v>

14
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud that she loved my music enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>to recommend it to my,</v>

15
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>to her fans and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means something.</v>

16
00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think she's a great example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who has been very careful with</v>

17
00:00:57.921 --> 00:01:02.921
<v Speaker 1>our brand and</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a name that actually means something</v>

18
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>that when she associates herself with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

19
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>it carries weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how many people can say that it's</v>

20
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

21
00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm proud that she's a decided that my</v>

22
00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>music is something that she really loves</v>
<v Speaker 1>her and that she finds worth</v>

23
00:01:20.771 --> 00:01:21.604
<v Speaker 1>recommending.</v>

24
00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:30.080
<v Speaker 1>He has influence on global culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to South Africa and Oprah there,</v>

25
00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>I go to Europe and people have seen me</v>
<v Speaker 1>on oprah.</v>

26
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:37.030
<v Speaker 1>There.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go to my good friend.</v>

27
00:01:37.031 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>His mother is from Pakistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A CC's me on TV.</v>

28
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>They're uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:47.410
<v Speaker 1>through Oprah and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's influential everywhere,</v>

30
00:01:47.411 --> 00:01:50.140
<v Speaker 1>but clearly she has influence here in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states.</v>

31
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

32
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to state the obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but her book club obviously makes a huge</v>

33
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A specific artists when they go on and</v>

34
00:01:58.331 --> 00:01:59.164
<v Speaker 1>perform their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

35
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.110
<v Speaker 1>their record sales go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mine go up when I go on their show,</v>

36
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means something to be one of her</v>

37
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:09.160
<v Speaker 1>favorite things or something that she</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to promote to the people.</v>

38
00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>It really does make a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that comes from her being known for</v>

39
00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:17.590
<v Speaker 1>good taste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>known for integrity and known for being</v>

40
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.650
<v Speaker 1>cautious about how</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think actually because of so</v>

41
00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>different</v>
<v Speaker 1>forms of media.</v>

43
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 1>So many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

44
00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disparate ways that people get</v>

45
00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:41.530
<v Speaker 1>information nowadays that the influence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of one person would actually be kind of</v>

46
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.540
<v Speaker 1>diffused in a certain way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for some reason a oprah has</v>

47
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:50.920
<v Speaker 1>maintained that power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even as people are watching less TV and</v>

48
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

49
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.230
<v Speaker 1>paying attention to the Internet more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even as people are getting their</v>

50
00:02:56.231 --> 00:03:00.540
<v Speaker 1>entertainment and all kinds of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still listen to what says and a</v>

51
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.580
<v Speaker 1>part of it may have to do with her</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience and maybe they're,</v>

52
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>her audience is still kind of a majority</v>
<v Speaker 1>women that stay home during the day.</v>

53
00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And so for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

54
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the TV's on and Oprah's on,</v>

55
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>she's gonna have some influence on them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and why not?</v>

56
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>I think she uses her influence for good.</v>
