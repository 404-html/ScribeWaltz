00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.060
<v Speaker 1>I once was</v>

2
00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 2>doing an article when I was working at</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fortune magazine.</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did an article about,</v>

4
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

5
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:20.380
<v Speaker 2>I actually did two articles about power</v>
<v Speaker 2>and corporations and I got very</v>

6
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 2>interested in psychological testing and</v>
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>

7
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

8
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.760
<v Speaker 2>and because there was a fad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

9
00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven or eight years ago,</v>

10
00:00:29.291 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 2>there was a fad for giving psychological</v>
<v Speaker 2>tests to people before they got promoted</v>

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 2>when Myers Briggs tests,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also other kinds of tests.</v>

12
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 2>I also was intrigued because back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>1950s,</v>

13
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a fad for aptitude tests and</v>

14
00:00:43.691 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 2>in fact it was concerned with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>aptitude test fads that cut will you</v>

15
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 2>make white to start writing the book</v>
<v Speaker 2>that became the organization man or the</v>

16
00:00:50.471 --> 00:00:52.630
<v Speaker 2>articles for fortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It became an organization man.</v>

17
00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 2>And included in that book is a chapter</v>
<v Speaker 2>on how to cheat on aptitude tests,</v>

18
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to take them on,</v>

19
00:00:59.201 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 2>how to cheat on it.</v>

20
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So I got interested in the personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>tests and I went to a psychologist</v>

21
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 2>friend and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you teach me how to cheat on</v>

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 2>psychology tests?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

23
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:09.514
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

24
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.570
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not allowed,</v>

25
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>professional standards.</v>

26
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:12.730
<v Speaker 2>It would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

27
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 2>but I'll give you one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you the battery that I give,</v>

28
00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cause she does executive coaching and so</v>

29
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:21.550
<v Speaker 2>on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she gave me this battery of tests and</v>

30
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:24.340
<v Speaker 2>gave me the feedback and out of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course I tried to teeth,</v>

31
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.450
<v Speaker 2>but out of it I got some interesting</v>
<v Speaker 2>feedback in which she said that,</v>

32
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 2>that she was intrigued by the way my</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind worked because she found that,</v>

33
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.340
<v Speaker 2>that my mind worked in a way that not</v>
<v Speaker 2>too many other people in her experience</v>

34
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 2>experience did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it made all kinds of connections to</v>

35
00:01:45.521 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 2>things in strange ways.</v>

36
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.441
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

37
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:52.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I leap from a to Z to m to l a to p and</v>

38
00:01:53.411 --> 00:01:56.020
<v Speaker 2>I pull in things from a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a whole lot of,</v>

39
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a whole lot of sources and sort of dance</v>

40
00:01:59.741 --> 00:02:04.741
<v Speaker 2>around topics until I get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I get passionate about an idea,</v>

41
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I swarm it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

42
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.190
<v Speaker 2>I overdo it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

43
00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.650
<v Speaker 2>I kill it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

44
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go all over it until I think I</v>

45
00:02:13.841 --> 00:02:15.220
<v Speaker 2>understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

46
00:02:15.221 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 2>or until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or until I'm bored and I go somewhere</v>

47
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's that kind of,</v>

48
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 2>there's not an orderly process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fairly physical process.</v>

49
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

50
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I squirm a lot around in my chair when</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm excited by an idea or you start</v>

51
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:33.070
<v Speaker 2>talking to people like I wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to run it by them.</v>

52
00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

53
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.950
<v Speaker 2>it's a kind of a noisy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

54
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 2>a noisy process of seeing connections</v>
<v Speaker 2>and getting excited.</v>

55
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.870
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
