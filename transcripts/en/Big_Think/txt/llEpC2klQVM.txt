And uh, in 19, uh, in 2005, we expanded the school and move to a new location. And so today we're serving a 1100 students in kindergarten through twelfth grade and these are inner city kids. I started teaching back in 1995 and did that for five years in the urban core of Kansas City. And then another fellow, and I have also a former CEO got together and decided to start our own school. And this was at the time when charter schools were starting to take the country by storm. And uh, uh, so we, uh, did some planning and sure enough we were able to give birth to a school.
