Speaker 1:          00:04          Everything really kind of depends on the budget. If Congress passes adequate appropriations for the war, uh, for the new fiscal year beginning in October, regardless of how angry they are, regardless of how much verbiage shows up and the congressional record or in the statute, uh, and Petraeus has given a reasonably free hand for another year, I think the chance of exiting with some degree of stability might be fairly good. If that doesn't happen, uh, if the forces in the field are crippled by appropriations cuts, um, um, that could be very bad from the point of view of either being able to prevail over a okayed in Iraq or, uh, um, being able to leave any kind of a stable situation behind.
