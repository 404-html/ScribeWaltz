Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:11          when I was in the Congress, I would have dinner every night because I didn't have a family and uh, there were other members of Congress who didn't have their families there and we went out and had dinner. Today I'm told it's a rarity to have people who are of a different parties that is to say Democrats having dinner with Republicans and vice versa. And that's bad. That's very, very bad for me. It's the idea that politics have taken such hold that it bars, friendships. It's worse today than it was then. And the reason is very simple. We were then the only city asking for special help that I can recall from the congress, uh, from the state legislature. Whereas today, almost every city in America has the financial problems that we do on a lesser scale or something, be on a higher scale. So I believe that the current mayor, Mike Bloomberg, was doing a magnificent job as problems that were greater than mine.
