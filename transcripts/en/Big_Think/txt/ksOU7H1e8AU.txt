Speaker 1:          00:05          Let's take the video of Philando castile's death. So that was, um, shot by his, um, his fiance and her readiness with her phone. And her quick instinct to use facebook live is very, was very potent in that video. People may remember that, um, she is watching her fiance bleed to death and at the same time calling out to two entities to witness her. The first is God and the second is facebook. So she wants our witness the purpose that we as users, as responsible users, as humane users of the Internet have. Our responsibility is to bear witness in that way. Um, not to experience it ourselves so much as to testify to the fact of the fact that it happened to serve as a massive jury of peers who would, who give credence to the experience of other people. And in that way, I think that was a, an extremely profound moment in the way, crystallizing the way that we all use facebook when we use it, right?

Speaker 1:          01:20          Or use twitter when we use it. Right. You know you have Newt Gingrich even now saying we don't have white white Americans don't understand the experience of black Americans and that chasm, that gap and understanding has been one that the Internet is in large part responsible for that. There's a huge vocabulary. There's a set of symbols. There's, you know what I think of as an idiom set, but also a testimony about experience that we weren't, that of each of each of us have each of us in different dialects, that we weren't allowed or we, we didn't have access to communally share. Now we are, as some people say in this adolescence with this, with digital culture and we're trying to, to, to determine what to do with this infinitely polyglot culture speaks so many different languages. You know, I was reading because why not? I was reading Henry James as account of being at Ellis Island at the beginning of the last century and his horror at what he calls the teaming and squirming massive flooding onto into New York, which now we would see as politically appalling, as a level of, of, of disgust that goes hand in hand with certain, you know, antiseptic right wing nativists thinking, especially coming from a waspy.

Speaker 1:          02:41          You know, Henry James figure mirrors almost exactly the vocabulary that people use when they describe twitter. When they described the youtube comments. These people are illiterate, they're angry, they're squirming and teeming. That is a natural reaction to people who feel like they belong here and their spaces being seized by people whose language they don't speak, who are, you know, in many, many ways alien to them. But the Internet shows us over and over again and the billions of us who use facebook, no, that that exposure is not only necessary but good for us, but good for us. It's exposing our immune system to test over and over to different means that confront our bodies the way microbes do and raise our immune system. Ask us to be more robust citizens.
