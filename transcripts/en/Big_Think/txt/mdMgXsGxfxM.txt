Speaker 1:          00:04          I wrote the best intentions out of the low points

Speaker 2:          00:07          in American UN relations and immediate period after Iraq and so forth, and that things are better than they were. I also think the UN has gotten marginalized in a lot of ways and partially because of the Bush administration, uh, I think we sent an ambassador there, John Bolton, who was very hostile to the institution that reduced America's own role, the Air America zone. Standing there. We also had the chief hand in choosing the Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, now ban Ki Moon is not quite two years into his five year term. And it is possible that he will prove to be a more forceful figure than he has so far. But certainly the impression one gets is that the United States chose them because they thought he would be an inoffensive pro-american figure. And that's what he's been. He's been an inoffensive pro American figure. But if we actually want the UN to matter, then we have to choose it's chief executive for his competence, not for his harmlessness. Uh, and so it's just troubling that we have not sought to use this institution in the way that it can be used. And I would hope that Obama,

Speaker 1:          01:18          we'll take it more seriously.
