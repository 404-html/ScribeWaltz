Speaker 1:          00:06          Attended

Speaker 2:          00:08          about a month ago, a meeting in Japan in Kyoto organized by a remarkable individual named a Koji Omi who was among other things or finance minister of Japan for awhile and I only saw one, has been holding this annual conference on science, technology and society and he calls it light and shadow, light and shadow, a very Japanese way of saying science can shed light to extraordinary positive things that it also has a dark side. It creates shadows. This is true of anything economic power, military power and scientific power have a bright side. They have a dark side. We must be very aware of that. I'm a great believer that we should have full freedom as conceivable for the human mind to explore nature and understand. However, we have to be aware of the consequences of some of the kinds of knowledge that we are beginning to develop and I suspect that over this coming decade or so, that we're going to face a lot of very deeply ethical questions.

Speaker 2:          01:37          As life science becomes more and more the basis of technology and action. We should never be afraid of learning of discovery, but we need to be cautious as we move into new technological areas because they move so fast, you know, in the old days, you could generally develop technology. It took a lifetime, uh, you know, for the automobile to reach 25 percent of the public, whereas the worldwide web did it and seven and a half years. So this, this pace doesn't always give us the time to think through before we moved. And we saw that in genetically modified foods which created a cultural figure in Europe that the people who were doing the original marketing really hadn't stepped back and thought through. So the two areas that I think we're going to have to think deeply about are certainly, uh, the whole world that's beginning to evolve of synthetic biology and the increasing genetic knowledge.

Speaker 2:          02:47          We're going to have a very selves and others. What really is going to constitute wisdom? How are we going to decide what one wants to know? Uh, how do we start thinking about things when we begin creating life forms which were doing, you know, you walk up and down the halls of a place like mit, hear the kids talking about biohacking. That means, you know, we're taking organisms, we're taking the stuff of life and we're mixing it up and playing around. We're not creating monsters when we're doing things at a molecular level that we have to think through what's going to happen. The whole field of genetic counseling, what do you want to know? Should you know, should you know that you've got an very high probability of having Alzheimer's, uh, later on. So I think most of the areas we have to think most deeply about are going to be driven by the infusion of life science into things that directly affect us into medicine, into the production and materials and so forth.

Speaker 2:          03:52          At the same time, I don't want to slow that because I believe within, it belies a lot of the resolution of environmental problems and so forth because we learned from nature to design and grow as opposed to physically manufacture materials. We can do it generally with a lot less energy, with more uses of natural materials and so forth, but we do have to think that through a more understandable example because we're in some ways further down the path is people will have some legitimate concerns about nanotechnology and it's a complicated area because a nano just really refers to building things out of extremely small molecules and particles and we've been doing this forever on one hand, but on the other hand, we're starting to, uh, take metals and various materials and put them in this very small form that can enter directly into cells, can be breathed in, in different ways.

Speaker 2:          04:54          Chances are 99 percent of it is not going to be dangerous, but we have to be willing to kind of make the investments as we go along to engage bright people who by the way cannot all be professional scientists and engineers. We need lay people and thinkers engaged and just think airway through some of these issues. At the same time, you know, I believe in boldness and I believe in taking risks. It's just that we don't want to take risks on scales and with people who don't know they're taking risk and so forth. We just need deeper thought and these newer areas because they're moving so rapidly and I think we're going to face some really tough ethical decisions in these areas and they're not gonna all be easily resolved and going back to something you asked about earlier, it can't just be science and engineering. You know it. We live in a democracy. We have political processes for making decisions. We just want those decisions to be truly well informed and questions shaped in ways that really make sense and are appropriate.
