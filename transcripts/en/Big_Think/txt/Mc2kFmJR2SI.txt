Speaker 1:          00:10          Chooses amongst self replicating entities. Those self replicating entities have some kind of power over that probability of being copied, of being replicated to being passed on. In practice, that almost always means choosing between alternative DNA genes. So it's about the natural selection, the disproportionate, it's about the unequal survival of genes through generations that is not for selection. We see it in the form of changes in phenotypes. That's to say changes in bodies because it's through the changes in the bodies that the genes induce, that they ensure their survival or fail to survive. The ones that are good at surviving are the ones that are good at building bodies that are good at surviving and reproducing. Where gene machines in the sense that her body is constructed by genes that have been successful in surviving in the past. They're good at surviving because they're good at constructing machines in which they survive. So our body is a machine for the propagation of the genes that built it.
