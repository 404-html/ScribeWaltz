Speaker 1:          00:07          A long time ago, maybe three decades or so, kids are the ones who taught us to care about the environment. We as the adults were terribly wasteful. We were buying hardwoods. We weren't recycling. Uh, we were just dumping things in the rivers. We really didn't have an environmental protection agency that was worth anything. I'm not sure if we have one that's worth much today, but we have one and so we learned and we adjusted and so it is with really young people today who were teaching us that animals deserve protection. They aren't things. They are fellows with us on the earth and that we need to adjust our thinking in the same way we did with environmentalists, but it happens that it is all tied together because the whole ecology of the earth depends on so many different species that intermix with their roles and keeping the earth and the air and the water's clean and healthful.

Speaker 1:          01:03          You know, you can go to some remote parts of Alaska. There are very few of them left today, but you can and you can say, oh look, it's uninhabited, but it's pristine. It's not uninhabited. It's inhabited by billions upon billions of creatures from the tiniest insect to the wolf, to the Eagle, to the beaver. All these animals have lived there, but they've never heard their environment at all. We come in with all bulldozers and our heavy equipment and our oil pipelines and everything else. We are leaking oil. Let's see from our ships, we have causing the animals of the oceans to die because of the noises of drilling and what have you. We have to learn that this isn't all about us. We are just ruining our own nest, so it is a big environmental movement and so the alignment between animal rights and the environment should be absolute and that doesn't even count the what we're doing with our diet because our diet is the most polluting water intensive resource consuming an occupation that we have on earth.

Speaker 1:          02:09          We are just deforesting take cutting down the trees so we can make cheap grazing land. We are pulling the water out of the earth so that we can grow crops and instead of eating the crops ourselves, we need 10 to 16 times as many crops to feed to the animals who we ultimately take more water to slaughter, to transport, and so on. It is just a disaster. Animal based agriculture has got to go and sooner or later it will because the water supply, we'll, we'll run out. We don't think for a moment that animals have more rights than human beings. What we think is that human beings are clever enough and moral enough to have responsibility to the others on the face of the earth. So animals are never going to do the things we do. I don't know any aunts who put down poison for human beings.

Speaker 1:          03:03          I don't know any squirrels who've declared war in Iraq. You know, we uh, the great, uh, override as of everything we, we're the great decision makers about everything. And we have very, very destructive for the animals take for their need. And we take for our greed. You know, you could reconstruct flocks of birds and herds of cattle from just the leftovers that are on the trees outside in the car door of my hotel today, that there's animals didn't die for any good purpose and they didn't die. Well, they die because we fancied something and we ordered more than we could ever eat. I think we need to be responsible and Peter has a great hope that human beings can be more like grownups and like big fat, greedy children and that we can look out for the basic needs of animals, which is leave me in peace.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Don't hurt me when you don't have to choose something that's kind instead of something that's cruel live by the golden rule of do unto others and include the animals too. To me, because there are billions upon billions. Something like $16 billion animals killed for food every year in this country alone. That's an awful lot of individuals and maybe a $100, million animals killed in awful ways and experiments every year and others use in the circus and dissection in the clothing industry and so on. When I opened the paper and I see an absence of coverage for all these individuals, then I feel that we have yet to wake up to a core part of what's going on in the world. If we are to self obsessed and we have to narrow in our consideration of who is us now. I saw a bumper sticker that says I am you only different, and I couldn't see who was driving the car turned and afterwards I thought, well actually it doesn't matter who is driving, whether it was a man or a woman, White, black, Chinese doesn't matter.

Speaker 1:          05:03          And that was the message is that I am you only different and all those billions of individuals and it took us a long time to even know that the people we institutionalized where individuals that people of other races were individuals that slaves, Africans who were brought to this country. We didn't think of them as individuals. They weren't in the paper other than if one ran away and we had to go and retrieve all possession. So the absence of the coverage about all the other animals who have interests is the biggest thing that hits me when I watched the news or

Speaker 2:          05:38          on the paper.
