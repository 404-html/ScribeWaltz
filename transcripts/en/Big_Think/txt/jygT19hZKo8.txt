Speaker 1:          00:09          Um, we hired somebody to help us with the business that was just, I should have, you know, when you say you should listen to your instincts. And we were feeling like we were, I don't want to say overwhelmed, but we know we needed a consultant for something and we knew we needed a consultant but weren't really sure how to address it. And somebody had recommended somebody and we both felt, you know, there was something off. And then it turned out to be very, very off. And I'll, I'll look at it that it was a learning experience and it could have been a lot worse. And you know, we caught it at the beginning and now it's almost done. But it's the newest mistake. I don't, and I think he might not hear it is the worst mistake. I guess. Maybe because he was toxic. I mean, that was the worst. It was just someone who lied and cheated and you know, and it happens. I mean, it's human nature.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Sure. A lot of mistakes, but nothing like big or bad.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Yeah. I mean we, we usually catch them at a certain, I mean the good news is when you're relatively small or yours, make mistakes, so relatively small as well. And when you're big it can be colossal. And so as a young, very supple company we can recover from, but everyone makes mistakes. I think the real question is do you make the same mistake twice? I think it's is important. I think, um, probably should have done, do more due diligence. I think it was just, we were, the business was moving very, very fast and frantically, we know we needed somebody and we were like, alright, let's just do it.

Speaker 2:          01:49          Well, we've, we've made, we've made higher. We've had hires that have been sort of got responses which have been great and others that have not. And we've had other hires that weren't necessarily a gut response, but they were hired nonetheless and again, terrific ones where we weren't necessarily,

Speaker 1:          02:08          you know, the lesson after two, three weeks, what you have. And we probably should've reacted, uh, more quickly than we actually did

Speaker 2:          02:19          for a company of our size. The thing that I think is most crucial in terms of what we do is hurting somebody that culturally is a good fit. And if they're smart and they fill the position in a, in a manner for which they have experience or we feel is appropriate, et Cetera, et cetera. Having the cultural fit and the passion for the business is probably the biggest hurdle because we're only 20 people of which, you know, 10 of those are working sort of right out of our office in New York City. And I think that's the most crucial aspect of, of where we are for this size today.
