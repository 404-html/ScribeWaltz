Speaker 1:          00:00          I think we have tremendous, tremendous growth, tremendous, tremendous potential in exploring the frontier of human beings. We are at just at the very, very beginning of a very exciting adventure and think of of diseases as common cold, right? But it's nothing terribly unusual about common called right, yet we don't have a cure for common cold yet, which is kind of ironic, right? Uh, which means that innovation could be very small for small things like common cold or big things like Alzheimer's and diabetes. We have multiple products for the diabetes today. We don't have acute for diabetes yet. Actually, if you add Alzheimer's and diabetes, it could bankrupt our health care system yet we don't have a cure for diabetes and we don't know how to deal with Alzheimer's yet. So if I look at the future, a couple of things will happen. One, we have phenomenal tools that will enable us to diagnose and to be more specific in better understanding the mechanism of virtually any disease.

Speaker 1:          01:14          And the second aspect would be based on that we can start now charter the, the road to veteran understanding the brain. We don't know much about the brain, we know a few things here and there, but the brain is a huge unknown scientifically still. We don't have a lot of tools yet to better understand how we think the memory and everything related to our behavior, so the brain will be probably the next frontier, but we should not forget that we have still about 6,000 rare diseases that do not have a treatment, so we have a lot of work to do and we cannot do it alone. I mean money and investment is one thing, but we need to continue working on the framework of the regulatory agencies and how we can partner with the regulators to have a clear path forward to having the new drugs approved.

Speaker 1:          02:07          The biggest challenge we face is science is moving so fast that the regulators have to catch up. They have to catch up to understand and catch up even more to regulate us, which is a very daunting challenge and I really believe that the regulators are doing the right things in most of the cases, but at the same time I can only see the challenges that they have to better understand how the science is progressing and you hear every, every, every day about the genomes and our understanding of the genomes. I mean, this is absolutely flabbergasting the progress we've made over the last 15 years in better understanding the inner mechanics of how we work and from that will come. New Medications will come, new cures, new treatments.
