Speaker 1:          00:07          We'll we talk about packaging for a second look. That dot, the heart of any university is its faculty. And with all of the developments, you know, if, if, if, if you ask me what the major achievements of mine now seven years as president of Nyu are, um, I would say to you that the two achievements of which I'm proudest are number one, the development of the faculty. And number two, the development of student life. And we have had enormous transformation even at Washington square on both of those dimensions. The heart of any university is faculty. And then the key is to bring in really dazzlingly talented students and make sure they in the faculty interact. And that's the formula you do that everything else spotless. And what ends up happening in, in, in today's world, frankly, is if you have the best faculty and the most savvy, smartest students, they tend to yearn for the kind of global network university that I just described.

Speaker 1:          01:21          It emerges out of them. The university president does not operate in a command and control environment, at least this one doesn't. I think what I'm good at, sometimes he's noticing what people are doing or inclined to do before they realize it. And, and, and then I'm a good storyteller, so I tell a story of it that they recognize and to which they then behave. Eh, so, so everything that I'm describing about Nyu as, as, as this global network university is something that I've seen emerging from my colleagues and from the appetites of our students. We can hardly keep up with the student demand to study abroad. Now, how do you envision a faculty in this Global Network University? I've described? Well, it, you know, this is interesting. I, I, um, I think that we're beginning to see the emergence of a group that I called the cosmopolitans. What is a cosmopolitan?

Speaker 1:          02:27          Well, a cosmopolitan is a person who sees a life in an institution that allows him or her and his or her family to move around the world, experiencing life through the Lens. Not simply a single culture, but many cultures that it's the kind of person that enjoys traveling. It's a kind of person that enjoys, uh, listening to ideas that a he or she has never heard before, whether he or she finds them inscrutable or repugnant or wonderfully attractive on first hearing. Okay. Do it. The, the, the, the, the, the, the curious now, a person who comes to Nyu or ready is a person who's eager to live in an environment like New York. And the hypothesis is in New York is the miniaturization of the world. We, we, we already present complexity, cacophony, wonderful human cacophony, not, not cacophony, that's grading, but cacophony. That's just my God aren't human beings, you know, amazing.

Speaker 1:          03:43          That kind of cacophony and, and uh, you know, the, the, the, that's the world that is coming because the, the, the complexity and cacophony of humankind is only going to become more and more apparent. And the question is, can we make it symphonic? So there's a certain group of people, these cosmopolitans that, that delight in that and, and have, uh, an almost insatiable appetite for it. So the bet is that among the very best people, you know, call them if you want the no bell or the Tony Level people, you know that among that there's going to be uh, uh, a substantial. Now what does substantial meaning in this case, in this case, substantial can mean 3%, 4%, 5% one in 20. It doesn't have to be 12 and 20. Okay. Cause you're gonna only hire so many professors even at the largest private university in the world.

Speaker 1:          04:41          But, but if you are the only institution, or at least if you're the first mover to become this global network university such that a cosmopolitan can become a professor at the institution and know that he or she can have the benefit of moving through the system. You know, with a certain amount of collegiality, you have to check it out with your department chair, your dean. But, but the, the, the assumption is there that you'll be allowed to move through the system, that you'll be able to give your children the benefit of growing up, not as American Mano Linguists, but a growing up on, you know, if you want to, by the time they head off to college, they could have lived on three different continents, you know, all, as part of a, a kind of fabric of a professional life at Nyu. I actually think that we will attract these cosmopolitans to Nyu in a disproportionate way and that they're likely to be among the most highly talented professors.

Speaker 1:          05:45          So I, instead of seeing the global network university as presenting, uh, uh, a challenge to faculty recruitment, I see it as presenting an with regard to faculty recruitment. And of course the same thing will be true of students. We want to make sure we explain ourselves to students. You know, we don't want some student coming in who's expecting, uh, Notre Dame, you know, look, now I'm a 50s Catholic. I root for Notre Dame every Saturday in the fall. Okay. I'm, I'm programmed that way. On the other hand is a reason Nyu does not do division one athletics that is deeply connected to its view of itself as the Global Network University and a complex society. And that is that if you gather people in a football stadium or a basketball arena all wearing the same colors, chanting the hymns that the cheerleaders tell you to chant, it feels very ozzie and Harriet to us.

Speaker 1:          06:43          It feels very 1950s. It is not the 21st century, a century of complex community. And we don't want to give our students easy community. We want to value community, tell them it's complex and then teach them the skills of bridging and tunneling out of their own micro community to those other communities. So instead of doing division one athletics, we give them exploration flaws in the dorms. What's an explanation? Fluids. All right? We would never do an explanation floor based upon the traditional dividing things. So we wouldn't have, uh, uh, uh, racially defined fluor or a religiously defined flow. But you want to live with students who love jazz. You want to live with students who love the stock market. You want to live with students who love Broadway theater. We have 80 exploration floors defined like that, all students from different schools at the university.

Speaker 1:          07:45          So there also a sudden now the bridges and tunnels united by this interest faculty member embedded, uh, er, resident assistants embedded to build programming each week around whatever the unifying principle is, influence silo. Yes. Out of the silo. Yes. Otherwise, shame on you. Complex community interrelating likewise, that's what we're going to give you. And this becomes an attracted to a certain kind of student. Not right for every student, but a certain kinds of students. So you have to explain yourself the fact that you have to explain yourself to students. You have to tell them come complexity. Community. Yes, but hard community. That's what we're about.
