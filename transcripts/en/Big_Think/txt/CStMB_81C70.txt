Speaker 1:          00:05          Fascinatingly, the story of how hip hop happened is actually the story of how innovation has happened in kind of every dimension, every industry you can think of, and it's this thing called cognitive friction. It's the friction between different ideas or different ways of doing something that actually produce a path forward that, that helps kind of any industry become innovative. I was especially fascinated by the story of the Wu Tang clan and how they did this in particular when they got nine guys, nine Alpha males with big egos together to form a rap group, which on the face of it actually sounds like a terrible idea. They're different styles of rap in the early sort of early days of hip hop. We're, we're kind of all over the map. You know, some more, more emotional. Others were more lyrical and they were all very different. And so you can just imagine the conflict that erupts out of this.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And then they got in the record studio together and they nearly killed each other. And this was because they were essentially extensively enemies and uh, or at least didn't have a whole lot of trust between them. The main guy who got them together, his name was Robert Diggs. He came up with this very clever plan. Basically he said, I will make a beat. I'll make a song. And then everyone has to show up and compete for the song. So you show up with your lyrics, with your rhymes and you get on the microphone and whoever does the best job, you're on the track or you're on this part of the track. And he did this and he basically channeled this aggressive energy and all of these sort of different ways of operating in hip hop. And he got them all to instead of fighting with each other to fight for the record and to kind of elevate this music.

Speaker 1:          01:51          And what came out of this sort of laboratory as like Adam smashing together and creating this great heat in this great energy and out of this was born the greatest hip hop group of all time. That many consider it that. And this is actually exactly what happened with hip hop in general. Hip Hop started with Djs throwing these parties where everyone who showed up to the party, you danced on one side of the dance hall or the other, depending on which music you like the best. So the djs would bring different music every week to try and lower the party to their side or the other. And this is some sort of fun party game. And what happened is when the DJ's announcers started competing over the best way to sort of drag people to their side of the party, suddenly that turned into a battle where week after week the announcers, the MCS would try and come up with more clever things to say.

Speaker 1:          02:44          And it eventually turned into this kind of war of words and music. And in fact also a war of dance. And what was awesome about it is everyone was in it for the party for making this party better, making this event awesome. And people started bringing tape recorders to record this music that was being invented essentially on the spot. Because it was so great and you didn't show up to this party next week after having lost the lyric battle with the same lyrics, you showed up with something different and in fact, all of the djs started hacking their equipment so they could do more clever things. This is how we invented fader switches and, and things that are now standard stock for any kind of Dj or any kind of party. They also cracked open their equipment and added more memory when they started doing electronic music so that they could have an edge in this battle.

Speaker 1:          03:33          And you know, recently Jay z was interviewed by, um, by David letterman about these days and he said that it was all about making this experience awesome for the people who showed up that night. It wasn't about killing the other guys, even if you're, your lyrics were about making fun of the other guys. It was about providing a great atmosphere. And so this battle elevated this whole thing and out of it was born hip hop and rnb and you know, all of the music that's sort of stemmed from that. All the culture that stemmed from that, and that's the same thing that happened with the Wu Tang clan. They cleverly channeled all of these different kind of approaches to the music and made something better, and I think that this is an analogy that you can not only see in the history of innovation in science and art and business and politics, but an analogy for what we should shoot for in our own work, for how we can get better. That the friction that the different approaches doing battle and smashing together. If we can make sure that they don't go too far or we turn it into something, it's about destroying someone else. If we think of it all as part of our collaboration process to elevate our craft, then we can go much further than we think we can on our own.
