Speaker 1:          00:07          Immediately I went to a day school or prep school in Jeddah, the only one to an international modern standard in the kingdom at the time. And he was, uh, essentially recruited into an Islamic group by a charismatic Syrian Gym teacher at his prep school who mentored him and taught him and essentially indoctrinated him into the Muslim Brotherhood. And that was the beginning of a series of relationships with mentors, essentially professional mentors that seemed also to have a sort of personal role in his life of dilemmas. Uh, who was a collaborator and, and Co founder of, of, um, the precursor organization to al Qaeda during the anti-soviet war. Ayman Elza Walker, relater, the Egyptian who co founded, um, al Qaeda with him though, is while he was his deputy, he was also in a, in a sort of biographical sense, also a mentor and a and a, uh, a kind of a patron of Osama.

Speaker 1:          01:09          The overall narrative is, um, you know, maybe not too surprising, but worth just sketching, which is he's a shy, a privileged, wealthy young man who is recruited into International Islamic radicalism and his mentor and doted on primarily at first because of his money and his older, more ambitious mentors want access to what he has, not only his own deep pockets, but also the fundraising world that he can open up in Saudi Arabia, but gradually as he, as he ages and as he matures, he either overthrows his mentors, are slowly separates from them and all and develops his own ambition and his own very full egotistical sense of his own capabilities. And I don't think in the end he is a prisoner of his mentors. I think in instead he, he sort of grows beyond them. By and large, evens watery,

Speaker 1:          02:14          always has often been a creature of media and has yearned to be heard. And this particularly as he came into his own and decided that he had a role to play in this narrative that he imagined he had been called into by God and, and where he was drawn. Also for reasons of his own ambition, he he loved to. He had an intuition about a brand building and about media that was really one of his core talents and one of his core insights and a source of much of his innovation and achievement and after nine slash 11, he had to repress some of those instincts because it was too risky to go on television as often as he might like. You can see him when he comes forward. Even after periods of silence, he comes forward with a video where he comes forward with an audio tape and if you read through the text of everything he's been saying since nine slash 11 when he does surface to talk or you look at those videotapes, you have the impression of someone who's in hiding but has access to a lot of media.

Speaker 1:          03:21          He's reading. He's clearly reading books. He's clearly as access to the news, whether it's on the internet or on satellite television and he's and you all sometimes you always had the sense that he's like watching President Bush on television, make a speech, and he just gets. He gets. He, I gotta I gotTa talk, I gotta say something, bring my media guy, and then he goes and he makes a speech and he's almost talking back to the, to the global media. So I do think is there is clearly an impulse that he has, um, uh, to be heard. That's how he's always conceived as role as a vanguard, someone who stimulates a and encourages others not as someone who needs to control a political organization or be the boss, but someone who inspires you.

Speaker 2:          04:04          It sort of confirms

Speaker 1:          04:06          the little bits of information that were available about his family's circumstances. In this period of exile, the Sama has had at least four or five wives. The wives that are known are, have all returned to their home countries. I believe almost all of his daughters, if not all of his daughters, have also returned home. He has perhaps a dozen or more sons and of those, some have returned home and some were believed like Hamza to be an exile with him if perhaps living with him, perhaps living near him. There was an exchange between Osama and his son, Hamza on the, on Jihadi websites in late 2001 where a Sama essentially wrote a letter to Hamza in the form of a last will and testament. And so Hamza, along with a couple of other sons, have clearly been with them. They've appeared in videos before as young jihadi is even at ages nine and 10 by now, Hamza, I guess I don't know what the video shows today, buddy. I would guess he's about 16 or 17. Um, and uh, so he would have been one of the three or four that you would have guessed was roughly wherever Osama's hiding along the Pak Afghan frontier that Hamza is out there too, probably a lot. And then Mohammed and a couple others are out there as well.

Speaker 2:          05:37          I think he's a long time

Speaker 1:          05:39          Afghan, Pakistan border. Um, and you know, sometimes to try to play a, sort of, have this parlor game you could play with people who watch al Qaeda or the pay attention to search for bin Ladin. Suppose someone walks into the room right now and says, oh, som has been captured, or someone just hit them with a Predator, a gay, you say, okay, interesting. Don't tell me where. Put a map up on the wall, take a pin, put the pin in the map and you know, 10 people closest to the whole winds, you know, where, who can come closest to where he actually was. And so where would you put your pin? And I would probably put it in northwest zero. Stand around Mirin shot along the border. There's a area they're controlled by the [inaudible] clan that he has long roots in. There are some risks to him if he stays in that area. And so maybe it's a little too busy and a little too trafficked. An alternative place where, uh, some other smart people who know them in intelligence, they tend to put their pins just a little bit north of that in Bodger, but it's basically a general area, um, around the, the federally administrated tribal areas. Probably more north than south would be my best stuff

Speaker 2:          06:58          very much

Speaker 1:          07:01          at a couple of levels. It samas ideology is not very fully formed. I don't think his analysis or his ideology or his political program are by any means. His strengths is he has talents, but ultimately, um, this sense of ideology and, and strategy is, is not one of them. And, and, and, and ultimately I think al Qaeda will be defeated by the self limiting nature of his ideology. However, to the extent that he has ideology, it has sort of two levels. One is a political sort of terra firma here and now set of grievances in which he's trying to give voice to a, an eclectic array of legitimate grievances in the Islamic world. And on the other hand, he has a millenarian view of himself as leading a preordained war called by God that will end at the end of time and at both levels the metaphor of a war.

Speaker 1:          07:59          And the fact of war are central to his claim on his followers. So, uh, when the Bush administration after nine slash 11 announces a war against him and frames a global war in which he is the adversary, it provides exactly the narrative that he's been. It reinforces and elevates and accentuates the narrative that he's been developing and certainly he would embrace and has embraced the sort of equivalency that the war narrative provides between himself and say George W dot Bush on the one hand, the president of the hyper power of the post early post Cold War period. And on the other hand, Osama bin Ladin leading the righteous forces of Islam against the oppression, uh, carried out by that hyper power. And so the Bush administration sort of fairly quickly realized, especially after they turned their attention from pursuing him and toward invading Iraq, that maybe it wasn't a good idea to call attention to his. So they, they, they've gone through this kind of bipolar or sort of swings in their, in their attitude towards the psalm as an adversary trying to not elevate and by not talking about him, uh, but then that only emphasizes the impunity that he seems to enjoy it.

Speaker 2:          09:24          It's,

Speaker 1:          09:25          it's an organization with a particular leader and deputy leader and a bunch of committees and a headquarters sort of. And some, you know, it is a continuous organization that was founded at meetings in 1988, has had the same bureaucracy and the same leader and deputy leader for 20 years. So there is an organization, it's called Al Qaeda, has a boss and it has committees that do finance and media and military. It's more than that though. It's also a movement that inspires followers who are disconnected from leaders. It's also a network of likeminded organizations and it's also a brand that attempts to attract other organizations and adherence, whether in groups or as individuals. So Al Qaeda is I think properly understood a synthesis of these characteristics today. Al Qaeda, the organization is resilient militarily in the sense that they continue to be able to run medium sized attacks into Europe. They are struggling politically. I think they are strategically, uh, in, in a corner that they're not likely to get out of. I'm very easily. But the organization a is still a factor in the security threats faced by not only the United States but also Britain and Germany and Denmark.

Speaker 2:          10:56          I tend to be the, I've been my

Speaker 1:          10:58          obvious sort of thoughts previewed the, the idea that, yeah, I think they're both right. I mean, I, I do. Here's a concrete example and, and I think it, it proves the case that they're both right. Um, the July seventh subway bombings in London, um, I think you can add the evidence is pretty well now established that that attack was supported by al Qaeda headquarters in Pakistan and was supported by the travel that some of the participants in the plot undertook to meet al Qaeda operatives in Waziristan. And on the other hand, the plot originated spontaneously in the disaffected lives, have some Pakistani originated British citizens in Leeds. So on the one hand you could say that attack would never have occurred without the independent grassroots individually alienation of the Pakistan Navy, Britain in leads. On the other hand, it would not have occurred also without the resilient al Qaeda organization. You can, it's like an extra drawing. You can emphasize one side of that equation or the other, but both are present in the narrative.
