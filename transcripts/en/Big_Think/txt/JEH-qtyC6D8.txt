Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:08          The thing is we have multiple goals, right? So on the question of stability, democracy is in really good shape. Uh, in fact, I would say that in the 2000 election cycle, um, one of the things that really got celebrated when George Bush and Al Gore were running for president, they get this quirky result. Everyone's fighting it out over the hanging chads in Florida. Of all the things that I worry about, who won the election for, you know, a couple of months and, and that we came out of that process and we ended up with a precedent. There was no military coup, there was no huge set of demonstrations. And for many people, this constituted a success, a win for democracy, that we are a country that is so stable, so rule of law, so willing to wait for the process to work. Then in fact, we can have stable transitions of leadership even when things are looking kind of rough.

Speaker 3:          01:02          So on the one hand, one might say, well, democracy is great. We're, we're quite stable. But I think that the story of the 2000 elections could be told another way as well. There was no military coup. There was no outright uprising in the streets. Right. In other words, all the things that that one might have celebrated as being about stability, one might also suggest, uh, reflects a lack of robustness, a lack of engagement, um, a willingness to defer to authority and to rule of law, even if in fact it gives us outcomes that have terrible consequences for decades to come. So I think, I think it does depend on sort of how one might measure or judge the value or quality of democracy. On the one hand, a great deal of stability, on the other hand, a great deal of violence on the part of ordinary people, sort of an inability to really penetrate the elites and to really demonstrate and discuss what the central issues facing sort of ordinary Americans are.
