Speaker 1:          00:03          I think the European Union is superbly positioned to become a major player in the 21st century. Um, and it has done quite well. Uh, the common currency, uh, the, uh, centralization necessary centralization coordination through European law, European courts, um, have done a great deal of good to the continent that was divided. Uh, so along I think Europe faces two fundamental challenges that are very hard to overcome. The first challenge is the demographic challenge and gray and continent, um, Europe is growing much faster than the United States is. And so Europe has to deal with that problem. Uh, that means that not only there are more people who want to retire and, uh, and get up state pension. That means that every year you have about 2 million people that are missing in the workforce because they retire and you need to replenish them. Um, 2 million, that means 2 million immigrants from somewhere.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Uh, there isn't a country close to Europe, large enough to supply to a million immigrants a year, let alone the, the question of cohesion of integrating these people into the European culture. So Europe has in faces a huge challenge, uh, much more so than the United States do. You had a challenge, of course is. Um, and that's the beauty of the United States. The beauty of the United States is that it, it pushes itself to the brink, but it never falls off. Uh, once it's at the brink, even extremely close to it then comes back. Um, and it retains its unique spirit of entrepreneurship and innovativeness. Uh, Europe needs to, uh, begin to harness that and begin to belief in its own ability to be entrepreneurial, creative, and innovative, uh, and to believe in itself. So far it hasn't done that. It's still always eyeing towards the United States. Um, I think a little bit more self confidence would do it good.
