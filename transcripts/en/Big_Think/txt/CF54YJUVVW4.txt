Speaker 1:          00:07          Clearly the price of oil has had an effect on the US economy, but it hasn't been pronounced. I think as many people feared. Um, I remember back in 2002 economists were spreading over their possibility of 40 or $50 oil. Well now we're at a hundred dollar oil. A lot of people don't like it, but most of us can still afford it. Now. It's definitely hurting a lot of people. I'm not making light of that and it's definitely a lot of people who drive a lot truckers, they're feeling a big pitch. Um, but oil at $120, you know, I don't know that it will be substantially different from oil at 100. Um, uh, the price of gasoline is going up. But, uh, you know, there are a lot of other factors now that are coming into the price of crude, um, besides demand. And that is the falling value of the dollar. And, um, uh, a lot of speculators in the market now affecting the price of crude. So you know, how much they increased price, we'll have what effect it will have. You know, I can't predict that.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Well I think that, you know,

Speaker 1:          01:10          theory anyway, the $5 a gallon price is one that people often mention as one where huge amounts of conservation people drive, we'll quit driving, they'll carpool or ride their bikes. Um, I think that that makes some sense. But for myself, um, I live in Austin, I often have to drive to Houston. Uh, if my choices are taking the bus or flying or driving myself, I'm still gonna probably buy $5 a gallon gasoline. And I think that, you know, for, as I recall about two thirds of the transportation miles driven by civilians, non non commercial operators or people driving to work. So I think even at $5 a lot of people are going to pay it because they have to get to work. So I think we haven't seen yet a price high enough. I think for, uh, a lot of societal changes overall in terms of the end of the suburbs or so on, uh, because, uh, we still see gasoline as a necessity. And I think for many people that still isn't, will be for a long time to come.

Speaker 2:          02:18          Okay.
