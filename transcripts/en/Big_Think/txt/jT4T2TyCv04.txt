Speaker 1:          00:00          MMM,

Speaker 2:          00:08          yeah, we all, all of us have a creative process and part of it is the structure that the advertising business itself gives us. You know, we, we do what we call a strategic document and that document gives us all the bricks that we need to build a house. It's like the architecture plan to build a house, but then eventually it all comes down to you and your partner. We always work in teams. Our art director, person in a writing person together. Although those lines are blurred now and then we sit down at 11:00 at night in our offices trying to think of something really brilliant that nobody else has thought of before and that process usually involves drinking a lot of water and going to the bathroom because when you go to the bathroom, either in the bathroom or in the shower, it's the one time you actually let your brain relax enough to think of something for you. Otherwise, if you're too stressed out and you're working so hard to think of something, your brain just kinda closes up on you. So we have a lot of water in the agency and every single time somebody comes back from the bathroom, they always say, always, always say when they come in the door, I have an idea. It might not be the best idea or the idea, but it's an idea. And it usually we feed on each other's ideas and that's how we build a and get to where nobody else has been.
