Speaker 1:          00:03          Watching children in early adolescence and in adolescence is, is always eternally heartbreaking for adults. There was a great article in the Times magazine about Christmas maybe 20 years ago, that the power of the Christmas mystery is when you look at a child the same way that you know in the story that the Virgin Mary looked at her, looked at her new son, the Christ child, and thought simultaneously this child might save the world and he's going to die. Right? So this like huge amount of hope we have for our children and this terror that they're going to die. If my mother looked at me at 13 if she read my diaries about how eagerly I want it to be popular, it would sound very like someone cording likes on instagram. You know, I knew if my outfit didn't go over well and I knew the way that a 13 year old might not post a foe might pull down a photograph if it on Instagram, if it doesn't get enough likes not to wear that again.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Right. Or I decided not to wear that again because being liked was the most important thing in the world to me at that age and for a reason. You want to know how you're going to play in the world. You want to know how to be in the world, how does show up in the world and you're testing and learning what works for you. And by the way, it's heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking when people don't like you or invite you to a party. And similarly, it's heartbreaking, you know? Now when you don't get the response you crave online or you get a response that's out of proportion to what you did. But you know, taking the risk of, let's just take the simple, you know, instagram brings up fears of narcissism because we're in heyday of self portraiture, which we've been in before. There have been other times where people, you know, sat for portraits or painted themselves and you know, van Gogh's self portrait is rarely regarded as an it work of narcissism.

Speaker 1:          01:54          But let's say that we have this popular form that as these self portraits, staging them, taking the photograph, taking many photographs, choosing the right photograph, cropping it, coloring it, and then distributing it immediately to, you know, this giant gallery space. And then like every artist trying to see who buys it, trying to see who's interested in it, trying to see if it sells and trying to see what kind of commentary they get on it. Um, you know a lot of people who post self portraits, and this was true in the early days of Youtube with musicians are actually looking for, in some cases for critical feedback. You know, remember the hot or not thing that where you put photographs were posted and you could decide I like, I don't like, um, that you know, which also plays on the right and left swipe of, of tinder is sometimes what recording.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Like does this work? Does this work? I'm in Beta right now. You know it. Do I talk loud enough? Do I talk too loud? Do you know that credible self consciousness of like, are my bangs a little too short? Are My eyes big enough or, you know, how can I inhabit this body I'm in and be an fit. The exigencies of social life fit the exigencies of a party or a workspace or by the way opt out of it. You know, there are plenty of, of of kids who are dialing back and we see among millennials are return to flip phones or to abstinence from computers, um, from, from the Internet. Um, and I think that's very interesting. The last thing I'll say, you know, when you talk about teaching my own kids, I feel very strongly that we can't adopt a true love waits abstinence program about screens.

Speaker 1:          03:32          The idea is not to teach your kids, you know, never go to parties, never live in social space, avoid other people. We like learning to live in digital space is not unlike learning to live in social space. And it's what kids want help doing. You know, I remember my mother teaching me this incredibly subtle social lesson, which is when you're describing a party that you went to, but another friend didn't get invited to, don't say the party was terrible. Don't say they missed nothing. Don't say it was awful. It's disingenuous. It's not. It's not fair to the host and it's condescending to the person you're talking to. Anything that you were left out of was awful. Right? So I, you know, I metabolize that lesson. I remember it was a sleep over and I was eight years old. Those are the kind of lessons you teach your kids online.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Are you going to be the kind of person that posts a topless shot on instagram? Well, that has certain requirements that's going to have certain consequences. Let's go through what those consequences are. If you, if you, are you going to be posted in all caps? Say, are you gonna use twitter a lot or you can use pinterest a lot. If you use pinterest, what are you going to use it for? What is the buy button about? Well, how much are you using this as to tee up purchases and what are you going to do with that debt? How are you going to afford those things? What are you going to do with the part of the Internet that shows your credit card debt? Say these are experiences that coach ought to be embraced with confidence, uh, to be embraced with confidence, not as though the party, the people, the city streets, the whatever are simply terrifying.

Speaker 1:          05:06          And the only thing to do is lock your door against them. But to show up with, you know, uh, you know, the women I know got advice from their mother that's too much black eyeliner, you know, that's too much hair dye, you know, getting, uh, I remember when I pierced my ear the second time, my mother said that's prelude to getting a tattoo. I didn't agree with her. Right. I didn't agree with her. I decided to that I would do it anyway and where a secondary thing in that ear and that was okay. But there are certain things that you say to your kid like, you know, my son just chose his, his uh, his g-mail name. Right. And he decided to use his whole name, like his first middle and last name because it showed up, you know, no one else had it. And that is a lot of letters to type in.

Speaker 1:          05:51          He's the got along name to type into Gmail all this time and I asked him, you may have lifetime of signing into things with your Gmail address. Do you really want to be typing all those letters? He said yes. When he chose his avatar for Google, he took a million pictures of himself. He's 10 years old and he opted to have one of those executive pictures leaning way back for lots of like authority and Alpha maleness. And I asked him, you're 10 years old, don't you want to be like a little cuter and more childlike? And he said, absolutely not. I'm going with the executive picture. And that was a good strategic decision for him. I think a good artistic decision for him, you know, empowering our kids to think like artists, to think like writers to think like novelists. They are creating an Avatar online. You don't want to be like, you don't necessarily want to be some Pollyanna Avatar who only posts great things about her life. Maybe you do or do you show up all the time? Vaguebooking and, and writing sad sack posts and talking, you know, really vulnerably like a memoirist maybe, you know, maybe, but those are choices that have consequences. And that's at that level of detail. Cause by the way, we all do it in our lives with facebook anyway. That level of detail you teach kids.
