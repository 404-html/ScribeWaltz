Speaker 1:          00:09          I think the most important thing about an astronaut is, is you know, you have to take for first of all, take for a given. That's a person's done pretty well at school, you know, has a, has the intelligence and all that to, to learn new systems and new things. Uh, but after that, the most important thing I think is being able to get along with others, you know, flexibility and teamwork, uh, those issues because as we get flight longer and longer and space, those, those are really important factors. Even on short shuttle missions. You know, those are important factors to put a crew together that can work together effectively as a team that can get along. And so I think for an individual, um, you know, I think the most important thing is being able to work with others.

Speaker 1:          00:50          You know, NASA interest, stealing hadn't done that much until fairly recently because we'd always flown short missions and we're all professionals and, and, uh, the thinking as well, you know, everyone get along for a, you know, two week mission, right? And so, and everyone can, so it hasn't really been a problem. The Russians had been flying long duration cruise since the early seventies. And in the early days they've ended at least two missions early because of conflicts within the crew. So they learned early on the importance of studying this and making sure you put the right crew together. Uh, since our, we began our work together on the international space station with the Russians in the, um, you know, early, early two thousands. We've started to, NASA has started to learn the importance of this kind of work. And so NASA is looking much more into it and funding more work into this, uh, through both directly by NASA as well as through the NSP Ri. And so I think it's important work and we are now fully on board and recognizing that it's important
