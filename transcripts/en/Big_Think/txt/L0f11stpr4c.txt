Speaker 1:          00:00          Early on, it seemed as if Muhammad's ambition was simply to go from door to door, from passion to person and say, you know, leave alone what you believe in. Believe in the one God, the one who spoke to me through the Angel Jubril. That's how you say it in Arabic and Gabrielle in English and then extort people to do certain things that in the 21st century we understand has religion, prayer, fasting congregations, that sort of thing. In the first 10 years in Mecca, I would say largely harmless.

Speaker 1:          00:44          There's that Mohammed and in a very modern way, I don't know if you know Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but you could understand him as a doctor checkup. Then he goes to Medina and then you have the Mr hired side of Mohammed. Suddenly there's a militia and now he's a politician. He's not only preaching, please come to the one God is demanding, come to the one God and accept me as a profit and if not, I declare war and he declares war and with a relatively small militia, at least according to the Islamic perception this is, these are other Muslim documents with a relatively small militia or a small number of men, he defeats a much larger, much more well established army and that victory leads to another victory and it leads to another victory to another victory. But it also leads to complexities because the more he gains power, he has a say over more people and that then leads to the necessity of legislation.

Speaker 1:          01:56          In hindsight, if you're in the 21st century, you are a political scientist, a sociologist or psychologist, historian, any kind of social scientist, you look back in that time, you agreed that matter to you will be impressed. You'll see goodness. This man was great. He defeated large armies, he established an empire, he legislator, he kept them together and he left a narrative behind that lasted many centuries well beyond. He was born wonderful. Of course, I don't argue with that. But what he also did was he froze his innovation in place. He was the last prophet. Nobody else could come and innovate on what he said. In fact, he declares innovation, the biggest sin that I believe I can commit, thus the fate of the heretics of his life. And so if you, if you take Muhammad's as the Steve Jobs or you know, the seventh century, I want you to imagine, I want you to think of a steve jobs leaving a legacy behind where he says you can never end.

Speaker 1:          03:09          You may never change the minute he finds himself on his deathbed, never change the iphone four or the IPAD air, I forget which condition these things were back then or the mark. So that's Tim Cook would never have, he would only have one thing which would be to continue it and to say these are timeless and that's pretty much what Muhammad did. The Koran is a timeless document. His example is rendered timeless and I think that is a disservice that Mohammed did to his own innovation. His great achievement was the fact that he managed. If, if, if that narrative, again, that narrative is a contested narrative, but if that narrative is true, his greatest innovation was to unite the Arabs, make them transcend themselves, unites into a super tribe and conquer. But the biggest mistake he then made would be to freeze things in place. And that is the curse of Islam. Is this the fact that innovation is a sin, innovation is a bad thinking. They close the gates freezer. That is the curse of it. That's the firewall to Islamic thinking. And we can see the result in everyday life. Again, I repeat. It's a perception of the people who put these beliefs into practice. What really happened is still a massive study.

Speaker 2:          04:49          Okay.
