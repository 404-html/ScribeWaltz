Speaker 1:          00:03          We are entering what I call the golden era of space exploration. The first golden era was back in the 19 sixties, but it was unsustainable. In 1966, the NASA budget consumed five percent of the entire federal budget. It was impossible to sustain that level of spending. Now it's about point five percent. However, now with the injunction of new ideas, fresh enthusiasm from the private sector, from Silicon Valley, billionaires, we have a whole new different landscape. Just recently we had that sensational launch of the Falcon Heavy rocket financed by zero, zero amount of taxpayers dollars, and it shows you that the economics have changed and now with the introduction of reusable rockets, we're not talking about opening up the heavens to perhaps a whole new economic landscape that is 10 percent. The cost of the past to put me in orbit around the earth, cost about $10,000 a pound.

Speaker 1:          01:10          That's my weight in gold. Think of my body made out of solid gold. That's where it takes me to put, just to go around the earth in near orbit to go to the moon would cost about $100,000 a pound to put me on a Mars because at least a million dollars a pound that is unsustainable and that's where the reusable rockets come in because we're not talking about dropping the cost by a factor of 10. Instead of $10,000 a pound spacex, wants to bring it down to a thousand dollars a pound. December of 2019. NASA will send the sls booster rocket and the Orion module around the moon on a robotic unmanned mission. Just a few years after that, the first astronauts will go back to the moon after a 50 year gap and buy later the next decade. We hope to have a lunar orbiter, lunar orbiter that gives us a permanent presence in outer space, not just the space station, but a lunar orbiter.

Speaker 1:          02:12          And from that we want to go all the way to Mars. And so NASA has already now look at the blueprints made by Boeing aircraft concerning what it would take to send probes to Mars. In fact, we may even have a traffic accident around Mars because of the fact that space x not to be done, they're proposing their big rocket to take us, not just to the moon with the dragon space capsule and the and the Falcon heavy rocket, but a new rocket, the bfr rocket to take us all the way to Mars, even bypassing the lunar orbiter. We also have a new vision emerging for Elon musk of space x is to create a multiplanetary species. However, for Jeff Bezos of Amazon, he wants to make earth into a park so that all the heavy industries, all the pollution goes into outer space. And Jeff Bezos wants to set an Amazon type delivery system connecting the earth to the moon.

Speaker 1:          03:14          I was talked to Carl Sagan and he said that because the earth is in the middle of a shooting gallery of asteroids and comets and meteors, it's inevitable that we will be hit with a planet buster. Something like, what? Hit the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. We need an insurance policy now. He was clear to say that we're not talking about moving the population of the earth into outer space that costs too much money and we have problems of our own on the earth by global warming. We have to deal with those problems on the earth, not fleeing in outer space, but as an insurance policy. We have to make sure that that humans become a two planet species. These are the words of Carl Sagan, and now of course Elon Musk, he wants to put it up to a million a million colonists on the planet Mars send to Mars by his rockets, financed by a combination of public and private funding. And remember, he has the vision, the energy, and the checkbook to make many of these ideas into a reality.
