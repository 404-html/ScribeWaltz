Speaker 1:          00:06          Scott schuman, the sartorialist what made me want to work in fashion when I was growing up, I played sports like all the regular kids in the Midwest, boys in the Midwest and a would read sports illustrated and you know, read all that, all the athletes that I liked and kept reading that, what they were spending their money on cars and music and fashion. And so I'd start picking up those magazines and like, um, I ended up becoming more interested in fashion than I did sports, you know, and the better I addressed the more attention they seem to get from women, which was more attention than what I was getting on the football field.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Blogging part was pretty easy. You know, I had an idea for the Sartorialist, this idea of mixing photographs of guys that I knew were stylish with guys that I knew were fashionable, which are two different things. Um, but I only really knew about websites at that time and I knew that a website would take too much time, too many other people would have to be involved. And, uh, when I happened to be going through the Internet, I found a blog just happened to click onto a blog and I'm the kind of person that once I see something interesting, I just started hitting all the buttons trying to figure out how they're doing it. And it was an interior design blog actually. And uh, I thought it was pretty cool. She had like 30 comments, you know, she had some good visuals up and once I saw that I was able to look at it in an abstract enough way to be able to say, you know, I could do this with my photographs, you know, that once I figured out how she was doing it and how simple it was to do, I thought, you know, that's the format I want to do.

Speaker 1:          01:45          You know, there weren't really any, um, kind of definitely I don't think any street style blogs maybe face hunter was right about that time. But I didn't really know it in the beginning. But I saw the potential of using, you know, a blog as a, as a visual format as opposed to with just text driven. At least I think most of the blogs at that time were very text driven. If they had a little bit of visual, it wasn't very important where for me I thought, you know, this would be a great way to put photographs up and then, and then put a little bit of text to create a conversation. But I'm, the simplicity is what made the blogging part. So the simplicity and the interaction with the audience, with the two things I think made it most attractive.

Speaker 1:          02:28          The difference between what's designers create or, you know, they're creating a little world every season, you know, head to toe a full look, you know, a head shoes, bags, dresses, the whole thing more street fashion is, you know, what people were really wearing. You know, there's an element of new, there's an element of previous seasons. There's um, your own history, you know, your sweatshirt from highschool and a vintage pieces. And you know, it's that kind of combination that I find so much more interesting than just the runway. Right. You know, and I love fashion. I love going to the runway shows. It's not so much, um, for me a shopping trip is, it is the appreciation of the craft of these, you know, um, design geniuses, you know, who come up with beautiful color combinations and beautiful proportion, um, suggestions and these kinds of ideas. Right. I look at the runway shows in a very different way. Just kind of a, I'm a romantic, uh, artistic interpretation of how they would like to see fashion going forward. But for me it's much more abstract of runways shows are much more abstract than, you know, what ends up on people as much more real to me.

Speaker 1:          03:38          Uh, oh. Realistically a fashion insider. I mean, I was in the business 15 years before I started the blog, so, you know, even though it was in a different part of the business, it was in sales and marketing. Now the people that I've met since I've been doing the blog did I know really beforehand, but I knew about the business, you know, and I, that's how I really came up with the. I, you know, I think part of what I do is the photography. I think that's half of it. And like I'm able to, I learned how to be able to shoot something in the romantic way that I see it. Um, but then the other half of it is the editing, you know, who I choose to shoot and not so much because of the drama and over overdramatic nature of the way they're dressed.

Speaker 1:          04:21          Sometimes it's very, very subtle, you know, my background and tailoring and pattern making and pattern making. And uh, I think really helped me understand, you know, the subtleties of a suits, you know, and why a guy can look great looking very subtle in a suit. And I think that's what really separates me is um, you know, I have a real understanding of actual clothes and how they work and how they should fit and you know, a reasonably good artistic version of photography that kind of captures that. And I think, um, that was really the kind of the best combination, a different screen fashion and style is a fashion is, is the, sometimes, you know, it's the thing that's happening at that moment. You know, sometimes it might be point issue, sometimes it might be heels, sometimes it might be flats, where style I think is something that's always there in your own personal wardrobe, whether it's a Navy Cardigan, uh, reading glasses like this.

Speaker 1:          05:18          Um, but that's different for everybody. You know, everybody's version of style is totally different and you know, that's what I think keeps me going out on the street every day is going out and kind of seeing the variations and what things maybe I had never seen in quite that way that I find very curious in how people will, um, be able to communicate their own persona through their clothing, their posture, the way they wear their hair. Uh, you know, I think all those elements end up becoming very interesting because I don't think I'm really particularly a people person. Um, so for me, I think it's interesting to kind of be able to read people in that way.

Speaker 1:          05:57          Uh, my favorite cities to shoot a Milan in Italy obviously. Uh, the guys look great. The women look great. There's an old school romance. I mean, it feels like Italy in the 19 fifties, you know, the guys at the, at the bar still were beautiful white dinner jackets and uh, you know, there's a formality there. I mean, it doesn't matter if it's 90 degrees in the summer, uh, and it's, you know, killer hot and in Milan and the guy still put on their jackets to leave their office to go get lunch and bring it back to the office. You'd never see that in America. Guys barely can put on their, you know, their shirts to go to the office or, you know, keep their tie done. Um, so I think there's a romance, you know, that they're willing to um, and enjoy that formality that they've created.

Speaker 1:          06:46          They're in Milan and, you know, all across Italy, but especially in Milan. So I love that formality. But at the same time, after about a week that I've had enough of that and I'm ready to go to Paris where it's more sexy and more, um, a more dramatic, more challenge, you know, in terms of how they put things together. Uh, and then back to America. I really love being able to go to those three different places and you know, in America were so much more sporty, so much more color, so much more, so much more difference in the way that we talk about our style and way we exude our style. We have in, like in Milan for instance, for example, they're very narrow, you know, they, everybody dresses in a few certain ways and they have beautiful variations on those few kind of styles. But in America there's million different styles, know rocker and vintage and sporty and preppy. And so I like that variation. So one without the other is not nearly as interesting.

Speaker 1:          07:48          I've been to Hong Kong, which I thought was very interested in Beijing. Um, but I wanted to go there more and 2010 and that's one of my big challenges is try and make it through Asia more. And I don't know. I'm curious to see what I find you. I think, uh, in Japan I think, you know, there's a lot of style and love subcultures, but uh, it'll be interesting to see how much of them, how much of the people wearing those clothes are really expressing something about who they are or who they want to be. And it will be very interesting to see once, especially once you get there, once you get to a certain city, like in Stockholm, you really get to know the people a little bit and what they're saying through their clothes. You want some more. To me, I think it's much more interesting than just the clothes they're wearing or the, the length of the skirt.

Speaker 1:          08:38          You start to understand something about that culture, you know, in Rio, none of the girls have short hair. A lot of the interviews I did in Rio, people say, what do you want to find in Rio? And say the one girl with short hair because they just don't do it. And once you get to know them a little bit, you realize that all the girls are afraid to cut their hair short because they're afraid they're men won't like them. So what you think of is a beautiful natural style actually becomes a style out of fear and it kinda changes your perception of it a little bit. So I'm a or for, I'm Japan, I'm very curious to see who is really doing something unique and who's just doing something because they've heard that's the way they do it in Florence and Milan.

Speaker 1:          09:21          Well, by that question, that's a, what's that an oxymoron? Trend in classic. I don't know if we can put those two together. Um, I don't know because it's totally different for everybody. You know, for me, uh, a Navy Cardigan, you know, always looks great. Um, converse tennis shoes, you know, just always worked. But that's for me. Um, and that's just, at least for me, I don't ever really look for trends. I'm looking for just what captures my attention at that time. And rarely do I ever look back and try and put together trends or say, you know, this kind of trend is important for me. It's about the individual expression. And if you go back and look through the, uh, through the archives, you know, you might find certain things become trends, but it's just not something that particularly interests me.

Speaker 1:          10:12          Blog took off pretty quickly. And, uh, I think it's because I had a particular point of view, you know, there's been other street style photographers, Bill Cunningham and the New York Times, you know, it was like the godfather of modern street style photography and other people historically. But I think what, what they had always done was they were always trying to, to find the most dramatic, the people that you wouldn't see every day. The people that were really different, uh, where I shot things that people would aspire to, something that maybe they would see every day but didn't really know the difference between something done well and something not done as well as suit that fits a guy really well as opposed to just another suit or dress the, oh, that, that fits a woman beautifully. Or the way that she's put this combination of, you know, uh, for an open toe shoe.

Speaker 1:          10:59          You know, two totally separate kind of ideas. And yet she's put them together in a way and you go, oh, okay, that does look really great. Um, so I think it took off now because I was shooting the incredibly different. But because I was shooting something people could relate to a lot of different people could relate to. And uh, I don't think there was one time, one particular thing that made me say, you know, this is really becoming popular. But for me it was, um, you know, these really heartfelt emails that we get from people that, uh, you know, that meant something to them that they could look at these pictures and say, you know, I look like that guy, but I don't look like him yet, you know, I want to look like him. I'm big like, Hey, I'm a little chubby like him, but he looks great and he's dressed better in his clothes than I am.

Speaker 1:          11:43          So I know these guys were printing these photographs up and taken it to Nordstrom or saks or dillard's or wherever and saying, help me look like this and would be able to achieve it because it was never in my blog. About how expensive it is, you know, I'm almost, if you look at most of the guys that are really well dressed, it's just the attention to detail and anybody can do that, you know, that just taking it to alterations in getting the right amount of cuff and all these little things that aren't about the expense but just not the attention to detail.

Speaker 1:          12:15          I think uh, economic situation is affected in the sense that, you know, a lot of people that have money always have money and they're still buying and they're still shopping. They're just not talking about it when we go to, when I go to fashion week, you know, people are still wearing new things and they're still shopping. But I think they feel a little more guilty when they've had to left five people go from the company and not bring to people that usually go to Europe, to Europe. So they're still shopping, they're just not talking about it that much. Um, but it's also, I think, helped people find a romance in shopping in their own closet. Again, you know, going back and looking at the clothes they already have. Because we've become so such consumers, they think people kind of forget, you know, what, what humongous closets we have full, more close than what they could ever wear. So like maybe, you know, open people's eyes again, it's really looking at what they have and kind of re engineering it and reworking it. And I think that's good.

Speaker 1:          13:13          No, it was in the business for 15 years. My ex wife was a designer. I had to show room where I worked with young designers, so I was very familiar with what designers look for when they're going out to look for inspiration and they're not looking for trends, you know, if it's something that's already out on the street now that's a trend now. It's not going to be something they're going to design for a year from now. It's usually much more abstract. And it might be a detail, it might be color combination. It could be even the way that the posture of a girl, you know, I think one of the things that a lot of designers look at my site is a, not specifically the pieces that I'm shooting, but I think they may be looking at a girl and think, ah, you know, I love the way that girl looks and, but I would never dress like that, you know, that girl inspires me.

Speaker 1:          14:01          But, uh, I love the idea of a long dress. Maybe she was wearing a long dress and they're thinking, oh, you know, it's been a long time since I've designed a long dress, but I would never put it in a floral print. I would do it this way. So I don't think they're looking at my site for specific inspiration. Like they're looking at an abstract way to get them thinking about that customer and that girl and that kind of girl that would like to dress and how they would do it a little bit differently. And, uh, so I think that's probably the most realistic. Or even the guys, you know, I know a lot of the designers take a lot of those old guy pictures. I take these kind of really stylish old guys and I know it's not because of the specifics clothes that they're wearing, but it's the posture and it's the attitude and it's the elegance of these guys that is attracting them, that inspires them.

Speaker 1:          14:47          And it's the same thing for me. You know, I'm totally inspired. It's not that I want to dress like an 80 year old Milanesa guy, but, uh, the fact that they can still carry themselves with such a, um, such, uh, an elegance even at that age I think is very inspiring and whether it's Milan or, or Harlem or wherever, I think that's something that guys really key on a lot of the designers key. And on a, when I'm shooting, I try and keep it just very easy, very unplanned. You know, I'm just walking around on the street looking for somebody that uh, um, I think it looks cool and then it might be able to get a good shot.

Speaker 1:          15:30          Today I was at Jamba juice and uh, it was a very cool girl and I'm very cool, a young college girl and you know, she had great coat and a little again with a port trim and another print dress and you know, nothing that she was wearing was expensive. It was all kind of thrown together but don't together just right, you know, the color combination. How cute she looked. She was very kind of charming. Even though she was a tall girl, she had a very kind of small persona, very kind of shy persona. And all of that's important. I mean, to me, the persona that she's creating, whether it's a big dramatic one or quiet shy one, I'm the way they stand. All of that is something that you want to try and capture in some way. At least my perception of who that person is in the photograph. And uh, so that's, you know, you never know where you're going to meet these people. That's why it's fun, you know, that's why I enjoy going out and getting lost, you know, hopefully every day or every other day and just seeing what's out there because by the end of the day I usually get back to my office and think, Oh, I never would've thought I'd run into that kind of person. They are doing that thing. And uh, by constantly challenging myself, that's why I think keeps the integrity and the sincerity of the blog.

Speaker 1:          16:41          Now. I haven't had too many people. I mean people turn me down, but I think I've gotten pretty good at being able to tell who will probably turned me down, you know, and being able to read people a little bit, you know, if someone's walking really fast and it looks like they probably have some where they're going. So don't get too many people that are upset. Um, I did have someone who was in the background of one of my pictures that I put up like two weeks ago and it totally unrelated, just happened to be walking by on the street, but he just happened to be looking just at the right moment at the subject I was taking a picture of. And so email me today a feeling that maybe he should be compensated for being in that picture and, and, and, uh, or at least a big print or something like that. So I thought that was a little bit odd. Um, but, uh, lot too many, too many weird or bad stories. I haven't been beaten up or chased or anything yet.

Speaker 1:          17:32          A Guy Ron story, a dot for, uh, not just because she's my girlfriend, but I do truly think that she's got the best women's fashion blog in the world. Um, her point of view is great. You know, she's, um, her writing is great, photography is Great. Her, um, the way that she communicates to her reader is brilliant. The way she writes and the ability to be that stylish and that fashionable and yet that approachable. Uh, it's a real challenge, you know, to be able to do that and do it consistently every day because you can't fake it. She's doing a lot of things that other blogs just aren't doing, you know, graphically. Um, that make it really interesting. I mean, my blogs doing very well at my audience is bigger than hers, but there are days when I look at her blog and I'm totally jealous, totally pissed that she hasn't told me how she did some of those things that, you know, just little technical things to make a shots look great or you know, how she's laying them out on the page or whatever. So, I mean, it's a good kind of challenging relationship, but I think she probably does better than anybody else right now.

Speaker 1:          18:38          And I hate her for that. I don't know, I guess, uh, with magazines, I've never really looked at them that way, you know, being someone who, you know, I'm a self taught photographer and I taught myself photography, just looking, looking, looking at the magazines. So, to be honest, a lot of them, you know, I hardly ever read, you don't really look at their, what their real fashion opinion is. Um, for me it's always been very abstract, you know, so, um, I don't know, I can't really, I love my fashion magazines, you know, a lot of times I get a question, you know, do you think blogs will replace fashion magazines? And I hope not because I love my Gq and vogue in Paris vogue and all of that. Like I look at them less now just because I've started to develop my own photographic style that I'm very comfortable with. But uh, uh, they really are the ones that taught me a, the idea of how I wanted to shoot.

Speaker 1:          19:34          Well, and it almost everyone in Hollywood, uh, almost everyone in the record business. Um, I don't know, you know, to be honest, I think it's funny. I don't really know. I'm not much of a, you know, I maybe said this before, I'm not much of a people person, you know, in doing my blog. It's one of the few places where being incredibly selfish, it's actually very positive. Um, because I'm not really, when I'm taking a picture of someone, like I don't really put their names down, rarely do I put the people's names down because it's just not that important, you know, I'm taking a picture of someone. It's my perception of who they are. I'm taking it by the way I'm taking it because it's some I want to be able to look at. I want to enjoy the picture. So it's my selfishness that's actually very generous in the sense that, you know, I share the picture, I'm trying to take a nice picture of them, but I'm doing it for totally selfish reasons.

Speaker 1:          20:27          And one of the things I think people misunderstand on the blog is just because I take a picture of someone, it doesn't mean they have great personal style. I mean, I don't know these people, most of them I've never met before. Um, you know, maybe there's just one thing and the look that I really love and that's all I want to focus on and I try and shoot it in a way that highlights that. But, uh, you know, I don't really have a lot of people and I'm just not judgmental that way and I think that sincerity comes through in the blog. I mean, to me it really doesn't matter who they are. It's not that I don't want to shoot people in Hollywood or models or musicians, uh, if I ran into 20 musicians in a row, then I'll look great, I'd shoot them. But that just rarely ever happens. I don't really fall into that. But, uh, it's for me, it's much, much more abstract.

Speaker 1:          21:16          Yeah. I think, uh, Tony Randall on the odd couple always looked great. I always thought he looked really cool. I don't think Jay fashion's really changed much in the last five years. I mean, the system is the system, um, if it was really going to change in a major way, now would have been the time to do it. You know, so many companies are closing, but they're not really changing their method of how they do it. They're jumping on the new hot thing, whatever it is right now. It's blogs, you know, who knows what's gonna, be next holograms or whatever. Um, and I think a lot of companies are closing, which is great. I think we're way too oversaturated, too many brands, too many stores, too many labels. Um, so, you know, if it was going to change now would be the time to do it. But it's not really changing that much.

Speaker 1:          22:03          Shipping's not changing, you know, I'd love to see a, a time when, you know, when it actually gets cold is when winter clothes hit the store, you know, as opposed to the winter clothes hit the store always on the hottest day in August is when all the winter clothes hit. So I think um, because of technology and because of this kind of speed of digital, uh, digital internet and everything, uh, it will change soon because smart designers, young designers are going to be able to start showing their collection in a much wider audience and ship those products closer to the real time. They won't need vogue and all these other places. They have to work so far in advance to promote their fashion because they'll be able to do it right. You know themselves through the Internet, right to their audience. And be able to, um, uh, ship the close accordingly to that audience.

Speaker 1:          22:56          You know, I think there's very, a day very soon where you'll be able to get some kind of digital printout of your body and have the clothes made for your shape. There'll be a new age of tailoring and um, you know, it's definitely more than five years off, but I don't think it's a really far away. You know, I think it's definitely in the near future and that will really change fashion, the fashion system, uh, in the sense that, uh, you know, you won't just have all this excess of clothes and things shift so early because you need x amount of time to sell. Hopefully it'll become much more efficient, much more effective if you're actually making clothes that fit people in clothes that people are ordering and want as opposed to trying to guess what they might want my readers or are located a everywhere.

Speaker 1:          23:41          You know, one of the things that I knew about doing a photo driven blog was that you didn't have to read English to be able to enjoy the photographs. You know, there were elements of people that are looking at it for the fashion content. There is an element of people that kind of like to live vicariously through all these different crazy places. I'm going, there's an element that likes to share their fashion idea. Maybe, you know, they had always dreamed of becoming a fashion designer and moving to New York or Milan, but for whatever reason, a family reason or whatever, they weren't able to do that. So they're stuck in Wisconsin or wherever they are. And this is their chance to kind of be in that community a little bit, share their comments, look at fashion, share it with an, with an audience. One of the things we're very proud of is we've been able to create an audience that's respectful that, you know, you can talk about your fashion ideas, what you like, what you don't like in a respectful for them. Um, so with that said, I think it's a, it's all over the place. I mean, all I know is right now when I travel and I do these book tours, know we always get a really, really good turnout. And a very, a very varied audience, you know, men, women, young, old, rich, poor. I'm the audience. Very much looks like, uh, like the, uh, photographs of my blog photographs in my book, which is something I'm very proud of.

Speaker 1:          25:00          New York has changed, changed a lot, you know, I've been here almost 20 years. And uh, maybe when I first moved here, people have said I'd be a horrible place to raise kids. And now I think everyone would agree it's pretty good place to raise kids. It's clean. It's a, a modern. I mean, I travel around a lot and um, I still think New York looks great, you know what I mean? All the time. There's new buildings going up, new. It's different kinds of architecture. Um, there's just always something happening. So I hate to sound like such a Yankees Fan. That's such a New York fan. But, uh, I still can't think of anywhere else I'd rather live than here.

Speaker 1:          25:41          Shoot from the heart. That's a good one. I think that actually just stopped at that shoot from the heart. I think, um, would be the best year I think. Um, it really doesn't matter, you know, I like to take good quality photographs. I'd like to try and have the light a certain way and the person's standards certainly, even though it's all very natural, it happens very quickly. I worked very quickly and work with what I'm given. Um, I don't really pose the people or anything. I just kind of worked with who I think that person is. But what I think I'm the honesty of it is I think people like to live vicariously. I mean it's the whole idea of this reality TV. They like to live vicariously through other people and see other people's ideas and other people's take on the world. So whether you're taking it with just a little digital camera, if you're actually taking pictures that mean something to you in a real way and you actually have something to say, people will follow that blog, you know, because you'll find likeminded people.

Speaker 1:          26:39          Um, but by doing that, I think one of the things that separates me is, you know, I don't shoot just all 20 year old hipsters, you know, old and young and, and that, that brand comes across in the variety of people I shoot because I actually have something to say and I can do that as opposed to saying one thing over and over. It gives me a wider vocabulary to be able to shoot people in a lot of different ways and a lot of different types of people. But you always know it's one of my shots and that's because you to take it very seriously. And uh, and I have a real passionate about, I have a real point of view. And uh, so I think, you know, that's what someone has to do before just deciding that I think I want to go out and take pictures of people on the street and like they really have to have a point of view. You know, it's very important what I don't shoot as opposed to what I do. Shoot. There's a lot of people in the fashion business I've never shot. Um, so without a, a real passionate point of view, I don't think there's anything you can do because then it just becomes a, a report on product and there's a lot of blogs like that and I think they're incredibly boring, you know, just a report of what's out there, doesn't do anything for me.

Speaker 1:          27:49          Well, passion and a point of view, number one, consistency. You know, you have to be able to create a consistent voice because if you're blogging in a real way, you know, uh, I think you have to do it very regularly. If it's not five days a week or six days a week in a way that people start to know when they can come see your blog, um, when there's going to be new images up that always doesn't have to be exactly the same time every day. You know, it's not so bad to keep them guessing. That's so bad to have him coming back once or twice, but there has to be consistency in the voice because you just can't fake it five days a week. Um, so I think that's really important. Uh, I think next generation of blogs, it's going to be just like the beginning of what websites, you know, you could kind of do it on your own and kind of habit and it didn't look great necessarily, but now, you know, blogs are getting very sophisticated and uh, I think people are going to have to really start to be serious about the way the blog looks.

Speaker 1:          28:48          That's, you know, the days I think of, um, just being able to steal images from all over the place to put them on your blog and just putting another two cents in on somebody else's conversation. It's pretty close to over because the blog is not gonna be able to grow that way. The blog is only going to be able to grow once you're in control of all the content. And like that's why street style blogs have grown so quickly is, you know, we're in control of the visuals were in control of the writing. You know, if you're using a particular kind of blog, you can be more in control of the ponds and the graphics and everything else.

Speaker 1:          29:21          I don't know, you can't really do anything. Yeah, I mean, at least for me anyway, because I'm, you know, it's so many different things. You know what I mean? It's the clothes themselves, it's the person. Uh, it's, uh, I just have to, you know, that's the artist, you know, there's no, I wish I could say as a marketer, you know, if you're wearing this brand and blah, blah, blah, that will make it really interesting, but it's not, you know, that's the artist in me, you know, sometimes you meet someone and it's just something that clicks, you know, and it might be an obvious kind of beauty or a non obvious kind of beauty or just something that you feel, you know, I shut this woman in, I'm in Barcelona the other day, this beautiful older woman and she, you know, really beautifully aged face and very perfectly done hair and fur coat.

Speaker 1:          30:09          And um, she was definitely not typical traditional beauty, but there was just something so charming about her and I don't think she'd ended up on anybody else's blog, but you know, that that is definitely part of my vocabulary. And I'm sure she didn't get up that day thinking, what should I wear to be shocked by the Sartorialist I know he's in town. Um, but, you know, that's the fun of it. You know, you just never know. There are people I see all the time that you would think, you know, maybe be on the blog, but if I don't feel something and don't feel that I'm going to be able to shoot it the way that I want, then it doesn't really matter. But all black is pretty boring. You're going gonna do all black. You better do some good proportion or texture or something like that. Color pattern, things like that. That actually real elements of design are always a good one. Good place to start.

Speaker 1:          31:00          My heroes are my mom and dad. Um, and uh, I think just anyone that succeeds at what they do through really trying to do something unique and difference and uh, interesting something that maybe not the people told them would never work. But that's um, you know, really, you know, says something about who they are and how they saw something differently. And, uh, and it's a bunch of different things, you know, the guys that do the Mac computers, you know, that design for the Mac computers I think are great. I don't know if they'd be a hero, but someone I definitely look up to, you know, take that chance of saying, you know, we're going to do them in color now. And then knowing as someone that used to work in the fashion business, how tough that is to go to the stores and say we want you to buy these computers in color now and that they're going to come back and say, oh, how are you going to buy?

Speaker 1:          31:52          I don't know what color, what percentage, but what color and what computer and all of that. Some that has such a passion for something and is willing to really, um, go through all the steps and be able to sell that concept to somebody. Um, you know, whether it's designing the Mac computer, whether it's Armani and the eighties, you know, doing completely different kinds of design for women. Whether it's, um, Bruce Weber kind of figuring out how to shoot people in a wholesome but sexy way, you know, those are the people that look at that. I think I'm most inspired by in terms of their work, an ethical dilemma. Um, I don't think it was an ethical dilemma, but I did have to figure out how I would handle having advertising on the blog because I knew that there would be certain people saying, oh, well, you know, here it goes, you know, blogs are going to go downhill because they're gonna have advertising and they're just going to shoot him.

Speaker 1:          32:48          American apparel was one of the first advertisers on the site. And I was prepared for people to start saying, no, now we're going to start seeing a lot of American apparel or whatever. But that never happened. You know, I think the sincerity and the integrity of the blog, the fact that, um, I was able to have advertising and it's never affected any of the work on the site that you never see anything about American apparel on the site. Unless it's something that I see in someone happens to be wearing American apparel that didn't. Absolute integrity and sincerity is still there. I just shot a big story for Berberi big ad campaign and I announced it because I was very proud of the work and showed some of the pictures I really liked from that project. And uh, probably did three or four posts, but I didn't put anything in there about, you know, where to buy the trenches, no information about it.

Speaker 1:          33:31          I was just showing the photographs I was very proud of from that project. And the audience totally understood it, you know, they, they, um, but at the same time, I love burberry and that was very happy to work with that. And I think the new reality is sometimes people have a hard time handling. The new reality is, you know, um, uh, you know, I'm an artist and I'm a, um, I guess, you know, that's the only way you could say it. I don't really consider myself a journalist. I'm not trying to sell you something. I'm not trying to tell you the story of these things. I'm just showing you my pictures, so I feel totally comfortable saying I love burberry or Ralph Lauren or whatever because uh, those are things that I like and um, so that's know that's hard for some people to be able to understand that, but because it's so consistent and I've been so consistent in how I present those things and how I let them be manifest themselves on the blog, that's what I think has been able to keep the sincerity and keep the audience. I'm believing in what I do.

Speaker 1:          34:36          The worst career advice. Uh, I don't know. I've never really had much career advice. My Dad always gave me great advice and um, you know, I think, uh, I mean, I hate to say it, but, you know, I wasn't a good corporate person. They know everything that, uh, made me horrible. Working in incorporation was perfect for this kind of job. So, uh, uh, I never really got bad advice because I never really asked for any think it'd be maybe like Pablo Picasso. I think he was probably crazy. I mean, I know he was crazy. I think everyone says he was crazy. So I think you just wouldn't know what would happen at dinner and I'd love to talk to them about art and how he challenged himself and was always trying to look for a new way of expressing his artistic, uh, his artistic expression or whatever.

Speaker 1:          35:24          But, uh, I think he also would probably do something crazy at dinner in and that would be fun. Maybe him and Tracy Morgan, the fact that, uh, I always thought I knew better than the people I was working for. That's not good. That's not a good thing to think that you always know better than the people that your bosses and and always create a problem for me. I always thought I had a good point of view on this, that and whatever. And it turned out to be okay. But, you know, at some point, you know, you always created problems for me working corporately. And uh, so at some point my dad said, you know, we can't always be them at some point. It's got to be you. You're the only thing that's consistent in this and that's hard. You don't want to hear that from your dad.

Speaker 1:          36:11          Um, but I know was probably true and I think it helped me realize that either I got to put up or shut up and uh, and so I'm glad that's when I went out and worked on my own. I don't have all the answers, but, you know, I really had to push myself to handle all the different areas, you know, because it's not just photography, it's running the business and its accounting, all these different kinds of things. So, you know, now I have, I have, um, the challenge of actually trying to go out there and learn a lot of different things to make it all keep going.
