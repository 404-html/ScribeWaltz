Speaker 1:          00:06          When you sit down and observe your own mind on purpose just for fun, um, as a kind of scientific inquiry into what drives you, it doesn't take long. Say if you

Speaker 1:          00:27          focus on say the breath is the object of attention and you're riding on the way as you're breathing. It doesn't take long before you'll notice that I'm some kind of want to comes up some kind of desire and maybe it's because your body is uncomfortable, so maybe you just want to fidget a little or shift posture, you know, and just do it this way or that way. And so very hard to sit still. Why? Because we're antsy. Why are we answering? Because we want to be comfortable and we're not comfortable. So rather than the holding the discomfort in awareness because why should we privilege comfort, comfort, discomfort? Because there is no ultimate comfort. That's why we shift from one leg to the other and we're always very shifty. But if you actually train yourself to be embodied, you get less shifting. I mean the mind just naturally settles. The body naturally settles and you can be comfortable

Speaker 1:          01:30          at home in your own skin, but when you're not and you want something, we call that greed. I mean, it's like, you know, it's greedy at wants something now that wanting to just be comfortable. That's fine, but when you start to watch the mind, you'll notice that it's got a lot of agendas on the greed spectrum. I mean, it, it's an greed is not quite the same as ambition. It has to do with greed, has to do with more for me, more of what I want from me. Then there's this other thing that you'll also notice, which is you're sitting there and uh, the opposite will come up. What I don't want, what I'm afraid of, what I need to keep at the door. Keep at bay to push a way. And uh, that's collectively referred to as aversion or dislike or hatred. You know, when it's really strong and direct the dolphin that other people or whatever, you know.

Speaker 1:          02:33          So we've got greed on the one hand and it is toxic. The more you're sucked into greed, the more go testicle you become, the more it's all about me, the more you're willing to sort of lose your own ethical foundation to get a particular result only to find that even that results not really satisfying. So you're onto the next result and it's a never ending trajectory. But nevertheless have to admit it's here all the time. It's not like, oh, I've transcended greed, you know, I don't think we do transcend greed, but we can transform how we are in relationship to it. And with awareness, the greed doesn't have to run us. And even if it's attenuated five or 10 percent, wow. That would be its own form of liberation, nevermind. Thirty or 40 or 50 percent. And the same with the aversion, like what I don't want. It's so bloody boring to sit here and watch my breathing. All right, so what, who thinks it's boring? Uh, have you looked at your boredom?

Speaker 1:          03:38          So have you looked at your aversion then as soon as the you that's looking at your revision, that's more like awareness. Awareness of aversion isn't diversive. Awareness of greed isn't greedy. So you're free already have those too, toxic impulses. Then there's another one which is like the madness that passes for the scenario in our heads and that's often spoken of as illusion or delusion that we're kind of like got these completely half baked explanations about everything and who we are and where things are going and what's wrong with the world and what's wrong with my family and what's right and all of that is Kinda. None of it's true. None of it's true, but we believe it that that narrative mode and that mind wandering default mode network, that's like my favorite pastime, the story of me and it's diluted and it also drains a huge amount of energy so we can bring mindfulness to greed and the greed can be attenuated or liberated. Mindfulness to a version and the version can be attenuated, deliberate or mindfulness to our own diluted nature, thoughts and emotions and so forth, and that is liberating of them. Then what do you have left

Speaker 2:          05:01          you

Speaker 1:          05:03          as pure awareness, fully embodied what comes next? I don't know. You're writing the script. It's not like, oh, then you'll feel this and you'll feel that and you'll be enlightened and everybody will bow down to you and you know you will never have to have any kind of challenges or difficulty. The full catastrophe will evaporate forever. No, it'll be the same old, same old, only you won't be the same old. Same because you, oh, you'll be the same. You'll have the same bank account. You'll have the same social security number. You have the same face in the mirror. It'd be aging everyday, but you will be in wiser relationship to your possibilities and to your embodied enacted unfolding of those possibilities moment by moment, and that means life lived fully. Wow. You have a chance while we have the chance, as far as I know you didn't ask to be born this pure gravy. It's just a total gift. Even with all the pain and suffering and the trauma, and I recognize the profundity of that and the rendering quality of the still. It's. It's a gift and your gift and silence in some sense at that point becomes wakefulness. It's radiant, it's luminous, and it's already you.
