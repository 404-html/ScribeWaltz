Speaker 1:          00:00          Viral Mark Zuckerberg for a day. First, I would buy more hoodies in different colors. The second I would discuss with my senior team, the practice of edgerank as it impacts people's personal profiles, so visa vi brands were brands are getting less organic views so they have to pay up to promote. Hallelujah. Take them for all you can. You deserve that, but I think that it's kind of dangerous where trixie and biff, if they have a baby or if they graduate from college and they put up their graduation picture, I think they think that if they have a thousand followers, all thousand people can see it and from what I've heard, and I don't know if it's true, but if it's true, not 1000 people will see it. Maybe 100 people will see it. And I think that if trixie and bf start losing confidence that facebook is the way to post their life story to everybody who has voluntarily follow them, that you could be throwing out the baby with the bathwater. And if enough people think this way and they stop using facebook, then you won't be able to charge the brands for promoting their posts. So again, I'm on the outside looking in. I know how these algorithms work, if there are any algorithms like that. But I think that's really playing with fire.
