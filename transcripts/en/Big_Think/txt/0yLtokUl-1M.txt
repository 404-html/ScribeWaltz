Speaker 1:          00:03          I don't think you think about building a company. I think you think about building a product. A lot of people ask me

Speaker 2:          00:10          the dieting, how did you start a company? And I always responded, we never started a company. A company is a byproduct of making a great product. We made six bags for Kate. We made two for Jack and made them really well and slowly but surely, um, found an audience for those bags, sold them to the right stores who had the customers who we believed would appreciate those. So we limited the distribution. Um, let it kind of go where it, where would go naturally and really focused on the product. I mean, if you focus on the product and you watch the market and you understand where there are voids and you find something that's new that satisfies a need, it's, it's so old school and simple, um, and be consistent about it and watch quality, hire great people. Really stay true to your original vision and then just expand on it. Um, then you have a company and a brand, uh, France take a long time. You can't build history into something we can't compete with. The Europeans have been around a hundred years, so we have to be more innovative and a little bit more clever and intelligent. Um, because no one believes something's well made when it's two years old, you know? Um, if you're a hundred year old company

Speaker 1:          01:20          still going, you obviously know what you're doing. Does that make sense?
