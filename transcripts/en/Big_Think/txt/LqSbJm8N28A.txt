Speaker 1:          00:07          You obviously accomplished a lot before you made mindfulness part of your life more than most people accomplish in their lives. So do you think that your clarity of thinking has changed in the last eight years? Um, and is it, isn't mindfulness necessary for clear thought or could you have it without it as you did for so many years before?

Speaker 2:          00:29          Unquestionably, mindfulness enhances, as you've said in your book and our clarity of thought. Unquestionably, both anecdotally and scientifically, we can. We can prove that point. One of the main reasons is because by allowing us to be in the moment, it means we don't stay with what just happened and that's one of the reasons that Phil Jackson now, the coach of the Knicks has given for making mindfulness mandatory as part of the next training, which I love. I love having a lead athletes incorporating mindfulness into their training. And the reason Phil Jackson gave is that he said, you're always going to make mistakes. You know the field learning the court. The question is, can you then move on and be fully present? Otherwise, you're going to carry that mistake with you and your actions and your decisions are going to be impaired because of that. Well, the same applies to life. If I'm still smarting over something that happened that I'm not happy with WHO and when come when the moment comes from me to make another decision or react to something new, it's going to affect that particular moments decision.

Speaker 1:          01:42          Yeah. It's interesting that you mentioned professional athletes. One of the things that strikes me about the mindfulness research, and you mentioned a lot of this in your book, is just how broadly it's been adapted. I mean it's not just athletes. We have the military, different studies with mindfulness. You have hedge fund managers like Ray Daleo saying that that's part of their success. All of these people clearly have used it after they reach a certain elite point in their career and then they use mindfulness to homeless, transcend, you know, to get a step further, to be the athlete who's not just a great athlete, but who can overcome the problems in the moment. Do you feel like there needs to be some work that has to happen beforehand?

Speaker 2:          02:24          Not at all. And I think with athletes, definitely we see them integrating mindfulness meditation training into their coaching right away. Uh, I think the reason why we have so many successful people who have accomplished a lot, who's burned out along the way and have not exactly lived very mindfully is because our culture is drenched in the delusion that, uh, the only way to really succeed is to burn out. I'm standing when you go back read, um, Thomas Edison inventing, inventing the electric bulb and talking about how sleep is something to be completely contemptuous towards, uh, the whole Macho idealization of sleep deprivation and burnout. That very, very deeply embedded in our culture, in our language. You know, we congratulate people for working 24 slash seven. We congratulate people for being always on. And so we have a lot of work to do to unravel that. And I think that a lot of people who have succeeded, I have done so despite the father, the burned out along the way, not because of it and I have included in the book a lot of people who are sort of iconic in our culture, like Steve Jobs saying that he came with his best ideas that lead to the most iconic apple products after zen meditation.

Speaker 2:          03:54          And he describes it very well, saying this was when he could hear more subtle things. You know, the idea that gender, you're multitasking, you are more efficient, is a complete illusion. And yet so many of us believe that that's why you walk down the streets of New York and you see so many people who can't walk without being on the phone or worse walking and texting. And I was one of these people. I remember when I stopped doing that, I started noticing things that I had completely missed. Like I remember going down the street where I live in her and seeing this beautiful building and telling a friend, this is such a beautiful building. And I said, when did it go off? She said 80 90, and I wonder what else have I missed.
