Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Working in Africa, I'm very conscious that there are 53 countries and that they are moving at different speeds. And the two also have important Pan African and regional African institutions. Uh, there was a reform of the African Union and it has a commission, like the commission of the European Union. Half the members of that commission are women. So there's a big commitment to gender in m a lot of issues in many of the countries. Now, there is a real sense that things are moving forward. And there was a recent Pew opinion, uh, sampling taken and most of the African countries sampled, really felt there's a lot of room for improvement, but we're on the right road commitment to the Millennium Goals, better governments tackling corruption. So I think there's a tendency sometimes to sort of write off Africa and a sweep as being a basket case or something far from it. Now they're actually very interesting and very progressive things happening in many of the countries in Africa.
