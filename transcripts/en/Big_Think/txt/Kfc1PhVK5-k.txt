Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi there. I'm Jason Guts and you're listening to think again. A big thing podcast

Speaker 1:          00:10          since 2008 big thing has been sharing the big ideas in little doses from some of the most creative thinkers around on the thing against podcast. We take ourselves out of our comfort zone. Surprising my guests and me are hosts with unexpected interview clips from big thinks, archives, uh, ideas that we didn't necessarily come here prepared to discuss today. I'm so happy to be joined by Professor Eric Kandel of Columbia University in the year 2000 he won the Nobel prize in physiology or medicine for pioneering work on understanding how memory is stored in the brain by studying a particular type of sea snail with a relatively simple nervous system. In his recent books, he's been pioneering in a very different way trying to bridge the gap between the quote unquote two cultures of the sciences and the humanities. His current book, reductionism in art and brain science continues this word looking at the ways both modern art and science reduced complex phenomena down into their component parts to achieve new insights and effects. Welcome to think again. Professor Kendall. Thank you very much. I guess maybe we should start with the cultural divide between the humanities and the sciences. I mean this is a very big topic, but maybe you want to start with a bit of an overview of how that happened.

Speaker 2:          01:29          Yes. I mean this was in the late 1950 [inaudible] and early 1960s CP snow wrote a series of give a series of lectures and motor series of essays on the divide between the humanities and the sciences. He thought that this was an bridgeable divide because humanists and scientists are not only had different aspirations, different goals, but use different methodologies. And the point that I tried to make in this book, the overriding theme is that humanistic aspirations are not unique to people who called humanists, but scientists can also have humanistic aspirations and all in modesty I can say the, the study of learning and memory is a humanistic idea. We all want to understand who we are because who we are is in large part dependent on what we remember about ourselves and that has a biological base, the biological basis memory. In addition, not only do scientists have humanistic goals, but artists use empirical scientific experimental methods. And my book shows several examples of this. Jackson pollock taking the canvas off the wall and putting it on the floor and flipping on it. This is a completely new approach to painting,

Speaker 1:          02:50          right? If you could give it a little, a brief overview of what what you mean by reductionism because the term has many meanings. Some of them pejorative, you're not using it in that way here. Like maybe you could talk about what reductionism is and how it, you know, broadly it's common to art and science,

Speaker 2:          03:07          right? Reduction is a miss taking a complex problem that interests you and taking one component of that problem and going into the great depth. So for example, on the cover of my book, I have an image by Rothko who's a color field painter and he's decided that he can convey emotions most effectively by using color. And he uses stripes of color in many of his paintings to convey a feeling that it's almost spiritual. And as he aged and also became more depressed, the colors change became darker. And the Rothko Chapel, they're dark browns and blacks and silly conveys a powerful mood in this way. So this clearly is a reductionist approach. He has a chance of doing many things besides colors, pick, use figuration and addition color, but it drops out. Figuration focuses only on color and simplifies the color pattern and yet we get a powerful response to it.

Speaker 1:          04:05          And this is a, yeah, correct me if I'm wrong, but the way I'm thinking about it, the goal of reductionism in science at least as you describe it in the book specifically, I'm using the example of your work with sea snails. You know you are trying to understand the complex phenomenon of memory by looking at a relatively simple nervous system, but your goal is to understand that phenomenon. Whereas the artists that you describe what they're trying to do seems to be less about understanding maybe then about getting at some more immediate experience or provoking some kind of response in themselves or in the viewer could, could you speak to that a bit?

Speaker 2:          04:52          Yes. I mean you, you described it perfectly. Reductionism need not simply solve a scientific problem, although in a sense every artist's solves scientific problems along the way. But it may be that of the range of emotional experiences. The artists were only focused on some rather than others in order to go into it in some depth. So for example, I mean the history of art from Giotto to 1852 claude monet was figuration, the whole idea of art was to deceive the viewer and to thinking that when they were looking at a flat surface, they were in fact seeing a three dimensional world and the whole autistic capability critically involved trying to develop perspectives, et cetera. That gives you the sense of three dimensionality, modern arts, reduce that. Why not accept the fact that we work on a flat surface and let's do the most we can with a flat surface and bring out new stuff.

Speaker 1:          05:54          And what they're driving at though as you it in the book, and you quote a number of these artists, but they seem to be driving at most of them is trying to get a more immediate experience of the sublime but, but not to demystify it in any way and that I wonder whether that's sort of the heart of this cultural divide sometimes between the arts, the humanities and the sciences that you know, science seeks to demystify. Whereas the, the arts at least I don't know that they do. I don't, I don't know that they're using reduction

Speaker 2:          06:25          and as well. I think you're absolutely right. I don't think the artists tries to demystify that is not the purpose of reduction. The purpose of reduction is to increase the mystery. I mean one of the wonderful things about abstract painting, if we look at a de Kooning of we look at a Jackson pollock is because the information is often ambiguous. It forces us to fill in the detail, and I described this in the book in terms of top down processing. We rely on our free association, our memory, our previous experience to fill in the detail of ambiguity. And that means that you recruit the beholder, the participant in the creative act. This actually goes back to Alice Rigo and took umbrage and turns. Chris, who pointed out that when you and I look at the same painting, we see it somewhat differently. What does that mean?

Speaker 2:          07:17          That each of us is recreating in our own brain? The image that we are looking at that is the beholder undergoes in a very modest way, a creative experience that parallels in a very modest way the creativity of the artist. And why is that interesting? I don't know whether you've had that experience, but certainly I find when I have the most modest creative idea, it gives me a great deal of pleasure. And I think one of the things that is so pleasurable about abstract off for those people who respond to it is that it gives you lots of room for your own creativity.

Speaker 1:          07:55          So now what's interesting though, with these abstract painters, and not all the painters that you described in the book are abstract. I mean, chuck close, you use this abstraction to build up, you know, portraits. But is that in a way they're, they seem to be seeding some of the, some of the control of the artist over to the, the beholders share like increasingly by saying absolutely. Right, right. The share is,

Speaker 2:          08:23          has a more prominent feature in abstract art than it hasn't figured of art. And this is one reason why some people don't like abstract on too much work for them, but other people who enjoy this get a lot of satisfaction out of it.

Speaker 1:          08:38          I guess where I was going with that is that it seems an unusual move for an artist, like our stereotype of artists is that they can be somewhat of control freaks, you know, wanting total control over the process and over how the thing is perceived. I think

Speaker 2:          08:56          that's definitely true of writers to some extent, but for them to make this move of, you know, giving more and more over to the viewer is an interesting move. I get your point and you're 100% right. It is only one dimension of it. I think they all control freaks. I think that pollock and de Kooning are perfectionist. And you're the, I discussed this one painting that Rosenberg who it was a superior, I guess, professorship here. Columbia came to visit him and saw this and said, you know, this is a wonderful petty at decoding, didn't want to release the painting, didn't think it was ready to go cause he, you still felt he could approve it and he told him this is a masterpiece. Get it out right now. So I mean they are very much control freaks, but they control freaks in the way they control Mba and they're controlling, I guess their own sort of their own experience, their own, right. Right, right, right. Then and then it's, then it's up to the viewer.

Speaker 1:          09:51          That's, that's interesting. Okay. Um, well I think that might be a good moment for us to transition into the, uh, the second part of this. Yes. This is, uh, this first one is Jan 11, who's an astrophysicist and the video is called three visionary scientists who embraced limitations to have creative outbursts.

Speaker 3:          10:20          I became interested in this phenomenon of constraints, inspiring creative outbursts. And if you look at the last century, there were three really profound examples of that. I would say the earliest that I found incredibly interesting was the limit of the speed of light leading Einstein to the theory of relativity where a lot of other scientists wanted to remove the limit. They want it to say there is no limit to the speed of light. That doesn't make any sense. That's impossible. Einstein actually, despite the word relativity, adhere to a very strict absolute, and that absolute was the speed of light. He took that to be his guiding constraint and by sticking to it rigidly, he said, I'll give up anything else but the speed of light. And by doing so, he gave up on the absolute nature of space and time. So I mean that's just much harder to let go of intuitively, but it was right,

Speaker 2:          11:21          right.

Speaker 1:          11:25          So she's talking about embracing limitation, like how limitation can actually push science forward. Have you found that to be true in your own work? Well, I mean, yeah,

Speaker 2:          11:35          in a sense it isn't quite a reductionist approach, but it's focusing on one thing to the exclusion of others in a sense. And certainly if you look at the history of go beyond mammies, do I take a larger problem? If you look at the explosion and understanding the biology of life that came with the discovery of genes by Mendel and then later on, but Thomas and Morgan realizing that genes are on chromosomes and then the discovery, the jeans are made out of DNA than a fabulous watson crick discovery about the structure of DNA of the gene. I mean these are all focusing on the gene to exclusion of carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, everything else. Those are secondary processes that derive from genetic control of cellular processes. So I think in a sense, this is not a universal strategy, but a common strategy. Often there are major variables that if you understand them, other things will follow more readily.

Speaker 1:          12:39          I guess it was a Karl Popper, I think it was, um, the WHO spoke about paradigm shifts and how essentially science proceeds by people laboring in specific trenches for long periods of time. And then either you have a visionary who breaks things open or, or, or those limitations of focus end up leading to breakthroughs.

Speaker 2:          13:02          [inaudible] pump has been very important in my field. Uh, in the following way, a cop, Papa felt you can't prove anything in science. Where do you can do is disprove. And that turned out to be a very important historical insights. Uh, there was a guy by the name of Jack Eccles who was a major, major person in my field and major student of synaptic transmission. And he thought synaptic transmission between nerve cells was mostly electrical. And with time it became clearer and clearer that this was likely to be wrong. And echoes became despondent at that time, I think. I think he was in Australia, I forget where he was, but he went to the faculty club and he bumped into popper and they became friends and he explained to him why he was depressed. And Papa said, that's ridiculous. You can't ever prove anything. All you can do is to disprove it, go back into the lab and disprove yourself, show that you were wrong, that it's not electrical, that it must be chemical. And that's exactly what he did,

Speaker 1:          14:05          I guess. Yeah. I guess I would be interested in hearing kind of as an adjunct to this, what you know in, in your field and the work that in the work that you do on, on memory and brain science, what are the intractable problems right now that people are finding themselves bumping up against that if they could solve them, it would be a major, you know, move forward. What seemed to be the new frontiers right now for brain science?

Speaker 2:          14:30          We're trying to see, for example, what is responsible for the reliability of memory on the one hand. And it's extraordinary unreliability and the other, um, you know, often we have the feeling we remember something when we don't write a well, we misremember it. Uh, and this is why, uh, testimony in is so unreliable. A single observer, remembering an event has a finite and not too small chance of being wrong, not by being dishonest, by just misperceiving misremembering, right. So memory is not, you know, stamping something into a book and you never have to worry about it. It's often modified as a result of subsequent experiences without being aware of it. So trying to figure out what controls that and how we can get a better idea into the core of the memory process is a very active part of the field. That's interesting. Do you think that that may have something to do?

Speaker 2:          15:28          I mean, from a cognitive standpoint that that may have something to do with kind of the pragmatics of memory? Like what, what it is that we actually need to remember in order to survive versus what we don't. I mean that were, I don't think it deals with the pragmatics of memory. I think it deals with the pragmatics of the brain. So, um, I remember this conversation for example we're having right now, uh, and it's possible that I'm sitting down one day listening to a similar conversation and I may confuse that second conversation. At a subsequent time as being part of the first conversation, you really, the initial memory and you often bring to bear on it some of the subsequent experiences associated with the second sitting, not just the first possibly because those things are being stored in us. I mean, I'm not asking you to speculate on science that hasn't been done yet, but possibly because those memories are stored in similar areas and we're conserving space or something.

Speaker 2:          16:27          They tried it and it can be activated in different words. And also when a memory is recalled, particularly the first few times it sensitive to disruption and distortion, so those things can interfere with the longterm fidelity of the memory storage. How does that disruption or distortion happen? I mean like so when I'm recalling the memory, the first few times it be the disruption is only in the sense that the memory is fixed, but the structures that fix it become unglued for a second, for short period of time. So the memory if perturbed can be altered. So if something like, so let me, let me put it to you this way. When you form a memory, it's a short term. I mean it doesn't persist, but if you train repeatedly, you form a longterm memory and the longterm it consists of growth of new synaptic connections and those synaptic connections require new protein synthesis doing a certain critical period that protein synthesis is sensitive to disruption and you can lose the growth of new synaptic connections despite the fact that they've occurred because the synthesis is not ongoing after, while that no longer happens, but in the early stages of longterm memory storage, it's susceptible to disruption and disruption can come from like other memories or ambient things happening around you, other experiences of the men.

Speaker 2:          17:49          Right. Interesting.

Speaker 1:          17:50          Interesting. Okay. Well I think, I think on that note, let's, uh, let's move on to the second surprise clip. This is Harvard psychologist Susan David on the psychology of defeating fear, low self esteem and hate live in the mind

Speaker 3:          18:12          when we have politicians who are effectively demagogues, who are inspiring fear in us, that fear leads to very particular and relatively predictable responses. When we off fearful there is this idea in psychological research of mortality salience that when our mortality is threatened, when someone says, Oh, this group of people is out to get you and we feel that we are actively being threatened, we are more likely to stereotype, we are more likely to respond to messages that we hear time and time again, even if they are against our values as somehow making sense to us. How do we protect ourselves against this? Daniel Conaman describes system one thinking and system two thinking system. One thinking is the intuitive response that can sometimes arise out of fear system two is the deliberate thoughtful examination of what is this person's saying? Is it aligned with how I really want to be? When we are able to step back from our fear, we are able to come to a place where we are ultimately protected from the demagoguery message.

Speaker 1:          19:47          Okay, so we're talking about demagoguery and fear and a, I guess an immediate point of reference in America in 2016 leaps to all of our minds immediately. Yes, I have have really your experiences like this. Oh, I would like to hear about that. Yes. I'm

Speaker 2:          20:07          Jewish and I was born in Vienna, Austria, and Myrna was nine years old, right? Hitler marched into Austria and was received by the Viennese in Vienna where I was living with open arms and immediately people who have been our friends turned away from us and essentially became our enemies. And that's because Hitler had fantastic antisemitic propaganda and he got this propaganda in pod from an earlier Vinnie's Hitler was in Vienna in 1906 1910 and the mayor of Vienna at that time was a guy called Carl Louie Vega, and Lucas was a terrific orator, a tremendous campaigner. He wasn't even all that antisemitic. He had Jewish friends. He would say, I determine who was a Jew, but he had a fantastic way of saying the reason you don't have any money is because the Jews are taking it away from you. It scared the hell out of people, particularly those that didn't have jobs, convincing them that the Jews, by charging high prices, by creating works of art, that expensive, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          21:16          Dot. God knows how many reasons we're destroying the quality of their life. So He created this environment of fear to which people respond to that. Hitler wrote in my comp, I learned more from low how to run a campaign than anybody else. And fear is of course the traditional way in which people pilled up opposition to one force in order to get support for another. And it ate. I found it very hard for the longest time to understand how people can listen to Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven one day and beat up the juice the next. Um, I, I wonder what that did you know, for you to you in terms of your thinking about humans at that early age to see that transition happen almost overnight. Like do you, do you have conscious memories of, of that? Of course. Yeah, absolutely. My brother had built this short wave radio set and we were listening to it as Hitler unwatched and to Vienna and then held them plots.

Speaker 2:          22:12          200,000 people came out and cheered him like mad. No, it dominated the scene. I walked the streets two days later and a classmate of mine came up to me and said, candle, I'm never to speak to you again. That was horrible. Uh, and, and they, you ask yourself the question, what is it that separates the good guys from the bad guys? And you come to the conclusion, I think the current campaign in the United States illustrates that, that every one of us is capable of good and evil. Reinhold Niebuhr once said, the capability of people for good makes democracy desirable. That capability for evil mixed democracy necessary. That's well said. And I recently read a book called machete season and it was about what happened in Rwanda and it was primarily based on interviews with these people who had been just, you know, workers, ordinary people living in Rwanda who then became the kind of soldiers of this campaign, this massacre against their tribal enemies. And just this sort of mundanity of the way in which they described going out every day to hunt other people. It was extraordinary. Yup. Yup. Absolutely. Hannah Arendt called this the banality of evil. Well, let's a little bit, I mean, I was very irritated with her use of that. This was an ice man and Jerusalem, um, evil is not for now. And many of the people, particularly in [inaudible] case, he was a major force. He was not a follower. He was a leader. Uh, but he was able to bring many people along.

Speaker 1:          23:50          No, that's right. That's right. There are those people at the top who are very conscious and calculating yes. And aware of what they're doing. I mean, I don't know. I can't, you know, I'm not a psychologist, but I, so I can't say whether it, Donald Trump is, you know, personally aware or conscious enough of what he's doing to be considered truly evil. But, uh, with his followers, you want to look at it and you want to say, these people are crazy. These people are stupid. But obviously that's not the case for all of them. Obviously. Obviously our brains are vulnerable to this kind of manipulation.

Speaker 2:          24:28          I think this is worth the trump movement is shown, is you would never think that a movement like this could succeed in the United States. And it's amazing how far it has gone, although it is clearly fading. And that is that there were people who were dissatisfied with certain aspects of our lifestyle to whom he appeals. And he does it by phobia of strangers, you know, preventing people from coming into the country,

Speaker 1:          24:54          et Cetera, et Cetera, et cetera. Do you have any thought, do you have any thoughts or insights from your vantage point? I mean, of having experienced what you did as a kid and seeing this happening in America and now, uh, into sort of what would be a better way to engage the people that are following trump now? Like what is America not doing? I mean, I know you're not trying to run the country, but I'd be

Speaker 2:          25:17          sure I can. I mean, I'm so startled by the success. Um, I think the case could be stronger and we'll be stronger if hilary ran a campaign a little bit better. And if she had run her life a little bit better. I mean, you know, she realized that she's interested in public office and I think the whole email thing could have been completely finesse more over this accepting large sums of money from companies for giving lectures when she's going to run for public office and realize the question is going to rise is she gets a half a million dollars or whatever she did for a lecture. Is she gonna feel beholden to those people? You would? You would think so. I mean, you and I of course would never be with some of the only guys that are half $1 million, but Hillary Clinton who had does one no.

Speaker 1:          26:06          Yeah. I mean it's a it that's right. I mean, even if she is somehow immune from to their influences, it's hard to preserve the illusion of neutrality. I think it's essential. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          26:17          I think she made mistakes and I think one of the reasons trump is more successful than it might've been is that Hillary, although I much prefer her, and I think she would probably make a very good precedent, um, did not handle herself in her public life in an ideal fashion. She did not handle herself the way Obama has handled himself, which I think is extraordinary. Sure.

Speaker 1:          26:41          But I, at the same time, there just seems be so much anger, so much fear here. And like I, it's hard for me to believe that trump just instilled that in everybody. I mean, obviously there were large numbers of people concerned about immigrants taking their jobs and you know, that, that have these, well, I mean, did you know our country is not perfect. If you look at the number of people who have billions and see where taxes they pay compared to people earning 40, $50,000 or $80,000, uh, it's, it's amazing. You know, there were problems in this country. Do I complain? Not too seriously. I think this is heaven on earth. I've had a wonderful life here. Yeah. Well, I mean, I'd like, I'd like it to remain so for coming generations. So hopefully we can avoid trump getting elected or any repeat thereof because it just doesn't bode well for, for our future. Yeah. Yup. Yup. I made, ended up the price of democracy is constant vigilance. I mean, I'm repeating cliches, but, right, right, right, right. Oh, but this is true. All right, so let's move on to the third and final video. Yeah. This is George Muster on the strangeness of Physics and Telepathy.

Speaker 4:          27:55          The whole progress of physics is to start with our everyday experience and to analyze it and look at it and look for deviations from it. So the very nature of action, really all the natural sciences, but certainly a physics is to really get away from our experience. So the things physics comes up with are just kind of a weird sub atomic particles. We can't see them directly at least, but we know they're there. We can actually do thought experiments about the things we do see and deduce their existence. So already, even with just that limited an example, we've gone intra beyond our direct experience in a hundred years ago or so, people doubted the existence of atoms, a lot of loan sub atomic particles, nonlocality spooky action at a distance is very much in that, in that mold. It's taking this yet further away from our experience and therefore we expect it to be weird. It shouldn't be weird. That's why physics is flooded. And as other scientists have said, you would expect it. In fact, if the theory isn't weird, you kind of doubt it cause you worry that your own biases are intruding into the, into the theory and causing you to think the world is a certain way when you're not listening to the way the world actually is. So weirdnesses in a sense a test of a theory.

Speaker 2:          29:17          I mean I do, I blog actually, but not completely agree with it. Uh, I don't think physics necessarily has to be weird and did weirdness. Sydney's not a test of the reliability of it

Speaker 1:          29:28          theory,

Speaker 2:          29:30          but certainly it deals with phenomenon that we do not intuitively think about all the time or at least people outside of physics. I'm thinking about it. And it deals with many that are invisible, have to be inferred. And some day biology will reach that level. At the moment, that's not the case. Uh, biology doesn't that all deal with things that are weird? I mean it's some weird things come out of it, but he tries to explain, you know, living processes that make intuitive sense and we want to understand them in a more profound when you can you say more about what you mean by Sunday biology make, make out there. Why, why would that happen? Well, I think we probably want to understand things on a deeper level right now. If we understand that the level of of molecules, we think we're making a great deal of progress, but we may want to make it, you know, on an even more profound level on the level of electron movement or something like that.

Speaker 2:          30:24          We seen this all the time. As a matter of fact take theory, which has such an important role in physics. It didn't have an important role in biology for the longest time. Um, when I came along there was a fair amount of theory going on, but it was mostly Malarkey, right? Because you can make a theory about anything. You want to have a theory about memory. I give you a five tiers of our memory. You know, people were coming up with theories, but they were not testing them. Right? This is changed. Now. Series had a major comeback in the last 15 years. This was true for a long time in physics as well, right? I mean they had all these theories that they weren't able to test without the particle reactors and so on. And so, so from the standpoint of lay people, it was like, what on earth are they talking about?

Speaker 2:          31:08          It's true, but, but, but in brain science it was a little bit different because they could test it, but they didn't think of doing it. They didn't think it was necessary. I see. To test the theory, but the fact is we can develop a theory for anything unless you say, now this is a prediction. Let's run an experiment to test that prediction, which is what's going on right now. It does brand science. You talked a little bit about your book in your book about how brain science and psychology have somewhat merged in. Oh, that Ronnie has impact on one another. And again, again, this is an area in which, um, people outside of psychology, even in the early stages, psychologists thought that these primitive guys from brain science, when I eat us up, they want to swallow the fear. And that's not, you cannot do biology of the mind without being a psychologist.

Speaker 2:          32:00          I mean psychologist described many of the obvious central phenomenon, a classical conditioning perception sensation. All of these things were studied in very reliable ways in psychophysical terms. And we we now want to do is add the biology to it and give it a new depth and new level of understanding. It's a beautiful case of coming together. In fact, I would go further than this. Uh, I would say there had been a sequence of mergers first it was a major between cognitive psychology and brain biology, sort of a new biology of mind. But at the same time this was occurring, it was watson and Crick and, and all these people are coming along developing molecular biology. And so the approaches of molecular biology, cloning, gene sequencing, them figuring out their function through mutations became applicable to the brain. So we can now test many of these ideas with powerful molecular approaches. Knock out this gene, get rid of this particular protein. So this put brain science and a completely new level.

Speaker 1:          33:04          It's interesting, I mean going back to the test case of psychology and brain science though I, that is kind of a beautiful model I suppose for the reconciliation of the sciences and the humanities in a way because,

Speaker 2:          33:18          well, Secretary Collins, you, in all fairness, by the time we got around to it was no longer part of the humanities and science as part of the management. I mean it is a humanistic discipline, but psychology at that time, cognitive psychology was empirical out laboratory tests, experimental discipline. Right, right, right, right. No, I guess I'm, I guess I'm thinking of like theory of personality and I'll do something else. The psychodynamics of it that still soft. In fact, I, you know, my, I was interested in psychoanalysis. I wanted to become an analyst at one point and I'm glad I didn't go that direction because psychoanalysis is dying and one of the reasons this dying is it has not become empirical. Right. And yet we do have these

Speaker 1:          34:02          big questions, you know about like about meaning identity, what it means to live a good and authentic tic

Speaker 2:          34:09          life, some of which are absolutely and, and you can ask him, there was a guy called Aaron Beck who developed cognitive behavioral psychology. I don't know whether you know this is about it. He was interested in testing one of Freud's ideas. Freud had the idea that people who are depressed or angry, they first express the anger toward others. Then you feel guilty about this. Then they internalize it, feel angry with themselves and that caused the depression. So Aaron Beck's what he would test this and he would test it by using the royal road to the unconscious, which is dreaming. So listen to the dream life is with depressed patients and did an all sound as if this was the problem with them. What they all sounded like is that they had a low image of themselves. He, this guy was a famous radio interviewer and he thought of himself as being, you know, so, so a guy was very successful in business, thought it was a failure at home.

Speaker 2:          35:00          The low image. And as he began to address himself to this issue of low image saying, you know, why do you think you'd like this, Joe? Look, your family really enjoys you and appreciates you. He began to alters behavior and cognitive behavior therapy developed. So what Aaron Beck did is to write a cookbook so you and I could do the same thing I see. And he asked other people to do this and they were able to get the same results. And then he did a prayer call, outcome studies with controls showing that mild and moderate depression, uh, significantly helped by cognitive behavior therapy. Severe, not so much, but synergistic with, we worked very well. So you can take these concepts and make them scientific. It just hasn't happened by and large in psychoanalysis. We don't know if it works under what circumstances and how it works. And that's got to come if it's going to survive at all.

Speaker 1:          35:51          Okay. Well, Eric, handle it has been wonderful talking to you today. Thank you so much, uh, for, for spending your time on this show. This has been a lot of fun. And, and to our audience, I would strongly recommend professor Kendall's new book reductionism in art and brain science. It is fascinating, beautifully written. The science has explained incredibly clearly and it's full of gorgeous reproductions of modern paintings. Thank you so much for your time, Professor Kendall.

Speaker 2:          36:21          Oh, thank you for inviting me. This is very enjoyable for me.

Speaker 1:          36:29          Sit for this week's episode of think again, I've been talking lately on this show to a lot of artists and writers and it's really refreshing to speak to a scientist, especially one who has lived through so many of the major developments in the past century in science and art and has so much to say about them. I hope you enjoyed that conversation as much as I did and we have lots of amazing things lined up this fall. It's going to be a really, really interesting fall. I'm going on a brief and much needed vacation, but the show will be here and I hope to see you back here next week.
