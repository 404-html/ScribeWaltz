Speaker 1:          00:11          So your question is how widespread is it with a NASA that scientists are convinced that human activity is responsible for climate change and this is something that's important to say very, very clearly. I have known and worked with hundreds of earth scientists at many different locations in NASA. All of them, all of them believe that human activity is responsible for the current climate change that we see going so fast. It's almost unprecedented. I want you to think about that. One thing that I take really seriously and I'm very proud of is that NASA is not a political organization. We are scientists that work for the American people were funded by taxpayer money, and what we do is we make measurements. We have many, many different satellites that are orbiting the earth right now. They're looking at things like ice on the oceans at the polls.

Speaker 1:          00:58          They're looking for things like vegetation growth and the change of that ocean level is the ocean level rising. Yeah. Turns out that it is. So we have many scientists all over the planet studying all of the different ramifications of climate change. We understand the causes. There actually is no scientific controversy about that. Humans are releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and this is warming our planet. Now, what scientists are researching currently and they don't all agree about is what are the most important components of driving climate change? Is it carbon dioxide? It could it be something else like methane and methane gets released. That's an even more powerful greenhouse gas. We don't agree on how quickly things like the ocean level will rise. People have different estimates for how quickly that will happen, so there still is scientific controversy about what the most important aspects of climate change are and how quickly it will go in the future, but there is no scientific disagreement with a NASA that humans are causing climate change.

Speaker 1:          01:55          Now, I started this off by saying that one of the things I'm very proud of is that NASA is not political and what that means for me is that I cannot advocate for any specific solution to climate change. That's not my job. That's up to policymakers. The people might suggest things like having more solar energy or cutting carbon emissions or things like that, but at Nasa we really understand that's not us. That's up to the American people are leaders and leaders around the world. What we do is provide the facts to everybody on the planet. All of our data is actually free to any government, any person, any scientists all over the world that wants to use it, so we all know what's causing climate change. We can't tell you what to do about it, but we can say it's time to do something about it.
