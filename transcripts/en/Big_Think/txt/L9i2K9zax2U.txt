Speaker 1:          00:08          I believe that the most important things or the service that you provide to others, I think that, uh, it's very important to be objective and clear thinking, not to get lost in the two great dangers that we have, particularly in Irish society, one of which is wishful thinking. Uh, we are always thinking that the world and everything is going to be better than it is. And the other thing is hype. Oh, Americans tend to hype everything as a result of that. We do not have a sense of proper proportion and we overdo things. I mean, the classic example right now is the attack on nine slash 11. It was a terrible thing, but it was only a terrorist attack. And yet the number of people in this country who have referred to this as the beginning of world war three and use that as an excuse for the military adventures that were in abroad now is I think just astonishing. Uh, the hype in this country, the sensationalism continually confuses us and causes us to make enormous areas. And my philosophy is avoid those things at all costs.
