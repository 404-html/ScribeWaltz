Speaker 1:          00:05          One of the concepts that comes up over and over again. Prolific creative minds that I've interviewed for the Tim Ferriss show or for the book tools of titans is creating empty space. And one of the guests, Josh Waitzkin, who never does any media, can I curse on this? Yeah. He always texts me with profanity laden SMS is because I'm the only one who can pull them out of his cave, uh, to do media. But he is best known perhaps as the chess prodigy. And I'll explain why I put that in air quotes besides how funny it looks on camera, uh, that form the basis or who formed the basis for searching for Bobby Fischer, both the book and the movie. He was very well known chess player and continues to be an incredible chess player, but he has applied his learning framework to more than chess. So he was a world champion and touchy push hands is the first black belt in Brazilian Jujitsu under the phenol and probably the best of all time.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Marcelo Garcia who trains in New York City, I think he's a nine time world champion, something like that. And, uh, he's now tackling paddle surfing and he can apply to just about anything. He works with some of the top financial minds in the world, hedge fund managers and beyond the best of the best, top 1%. So why? What are the principles that he shares? One of them is uh, creating empty space, cultivating empty space as a way of life. And these are all tied together so much. And another one, learning the macro from the micro and then beginning with the end in mind. And these all work together. So I'll explain. In fact, the last two first Josh learned to play chess, or I should say more accurately, was coached by his first real coach in the opposite direction when compared to most training and most chess books.

Speaker 1:          01:59          He was taught in reverse. What does that mean? He began with the end game and with very few pieces. So they cleared all the pieces off the board instead of starting with openings. Meaning what do you do first? The first five to 10 moves, start with the end game with king and pawn versus king. What does this do? Well, this forces you to focus on principles like opposition creating space, uh, Zugzwang, which is a principle of forcing your opponent to do anything that will destroy their position or anything they can possibly do, well worse in their position and these types of principles that you learn when there's an empty board with a few pieces, uh, accomplish a few things. Number one, you are learning the macro, the principles that you can apply throughout the game of chess in almost any scenario, uh, through the micro, this, this end game situation.

Speaker 1:          02:57          And these principles are adaptable. You become a machine that can bob and weave with the circumstances very effectively compared to that as josh would put, put it if you're memorizing the openings. Okay. And this might be like memorizing recipes. If you're learning to cook, uh, you're effectively stealing the answers from the teacher's guidebook to a test and you'll be able to beat your friends for awhile and, uh, maybe even be considered a pretty decent chess player. But on a deep level, you don't understand the game and you will not, you'll hit a ceiling and you will never progress past that. And you'll get beaten by really good players so that can be applied to, for instance, Brazilian Jujitsu, Josh told, taught me basically all of the most important principles of Jujitsu through one move at the end game, which is as a choke called the guillotine, which Marcelo was famous for.

Speaker 1:          03:48          His version is called the Marcello teen, but it's effectively like this. You're choking someone's head here and he has a weird way of doing it where he puts his forum on top of your shoulder. It's pretty wicked. If you want to be put unconscious, you can go to that gym and, and a experience that yourself, but uh, that can also be applied to many, many other things. For instance, if you're trying to build a start up, all right, this is, this is a common trendy thing to do these days and I think everybody should start a business at some point. Uh, but in the startup game in say Silicon Valley where I live, if you're going to go into the venture backed world, well you and your founder, but I think a lot about the end game and you should definitely have an agreement, at least a working agreement, a tentative agreement on what type of exit, say acquisition offer is acceptable to you.

Speaker 1:          04:36          If those those end goal components aren't in place, then it's just a slow motion train wreck waiting to happen. And how might you do that? Well, if you're trying to learn the macro from micro, you could think about what the acquisition agreement might look like. So you could talk to lawyers, get a sample template agreement and look at the provisions, look at the clauses, and then reverse engineer it so that when you're forming the company and when you're hiring employees, your decisions at that point make it possible to have that contract at the end. This is another example, micro, maybe it's a 10 20 page document, macro building, a company that gets acquired by a much, much larger company. Uh, so that is learning the macro from the micro. Uh, another example, just because I brought up cooking would be saying, choosing a recipe that involves two or three primary techniques and perhaps three to five primary ingredients that apply in many, many, many different dishes.

Speaker 1:          05:40          So you're learning principles of safe flavor, combination principles of using convection versus shallow frying or saw Tang versus steaming. Okay. Uh, that apply across the board. And in doing so, let's say you do without a recipe, without a timer, uh, or I should say a meat thermometer or something like that. You're going to learn also to test the food to know whether it has done or not. That then applies to everything. But you can do it just learning how to make Harissa crab cakes with steam Broccoli and I have no idea, say candied yams, something like that. All right, so that's that. Now none. We were also talking about the end game, so we've covered that, creating it. We're cultivating empty spaces, way of life. This is very important to Josh Waitzkin, who I mentioned. It's very important to people like Paul Graham who's the Co founder of y combinator, which is like the navy seals, Harvard of startup accelerators, keeping it simple, let's, let's just call it that for now.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Creating, if you are a creator, if you are a maker and not a manager, this is important. Creating three to five, which by the way is a decision. Uh, so a lot of really good entrepreneurs start as a technician or a tactician. They're very, very good at one thing. Then they end up in a managerial role that they hate. It doesn't mean you have to stay there and you see a lot of folks like Evan Williams and others who then at some point realize this and return to a more product focused, uh, role. Even if they are also the CEO making some high level 30,000 foot decisions. Okay? But if you are a maker, if you've decided to be a maker, if you just happen to be maker or a creator, let's call it three to five hour uninterrupted blocks of time are extremely critical. If you want to connect the dots, if you want to have the space to allow yourself to have original ideas or at least our original combinations of ideas, you really need to block out that time and protect it at least once a week.

Speaker 1:          07:47          So in tools of titans, there are many people who do this. We meet Seti for instance. There's a very, very successful, um, multi, multimillion dollar business that he built out of a blog he started a long ago in college, which was very, very niche. And its focus, he blocks out, I believe it's every Wednesday for three to five hours of time. He will block it out for learning. Uh, Noah Kagan, another entrepreneur does the same thing. So on Wednesdays for me, I have from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM. This is pre lunch. I have creation. That means writing, recording or some similar aspect of, in my mind, creating with, with my skillset and my assets and a, it is extremely important that I do that before I'm barraged by inputs. In other words, and this is true of Josh as well. First thing in the morning, he's doing journaling.

Speaker 1:          08:41          Reid Hoffman, billionaire go founder or founder of Linkedin, same story. He will plant a seed in his mind the night before a problem. He wants to solve a project. He wants to think about improving perhaps and then waking up row, Tabula Rasa, complete blank slate immediately working on that problem with journaling before any text messages before any email, which is why for instance, I don't have email set up on my phone, I do not have mail set up on my iphone and I did not get notifications. I also put my phone on airplane mode for a lot of reasons for the four hour body, explained some of the physical ones but on to airplane mode when I go to bed and it stays in airplane mode until I am done with my creation period. And then it comes on because as soon as you go into bullet dodging or like wonder woman bullet blocking mode with uh, everyone else's agenda for your time, which is very often the inbox or text messages, you're Doa, you'd done your creativity is, is all for naught in general. So for, for me, for many people who are say, programming for musicians, for creative types, slack in the system, you have to create slack. You have to create space. You have to create large, uninterrupted blocks of time. And the only way to do that is to put it on your calendar. If it's not on your calendar, it's not real. You need to put it in your calendar and defend it just like you would anything else.
