Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, we're to human rights come from, you know, here you can say where do they write so the comatose come from or the babies come from. It's the fact that within us we have a sense of moral purpose and we know innately most of us, whether something seems right or seems wrong and we have the rules that we live our lives by which they do not do such and such to some individual, it may hurt to not be disrespectful and I think that that has to extend beyond those we relate to most because the true test of compassion is if you can be decent to those, you relate to least. So I believe it comes from within us from where we get kindness generally and where we're able to be altruistic to others. That's where it. We should extend that.
