Speaker 1:          00:09          It's funny cause I was talking about this with a woman named Amy Aright, who was one of the co founders of e trade and, uh, Olivia cruises the other day. We were on a panel together at a gay Mba conference and we were talking a little bit about what it, what does it mean to be an entrepreneur and what are the challenges? And both of us sort of asserted that there really weren't any as far as we could tell. And principally I believe that, um, there's still a ton of homophobia in the world and there's a ton of homophobia in the business world. But because I've been very out and very explicitly out in my life, I'm in my professional life from the beginning. I just don't hear it. So if you don't like me because I'm gay or you don't want to do business with me because I'm gay, then I probably just don't even know that because you're just steering clear of me.

Speaker 1:          00:52          You know, it's when you're closeted and people don't know that you're gay, that you hear and see the things that are otherwise unsavory, you know? And I just, I don't necessarily want to change everybody's mind in the world about, um, you know, about homosexuality or Judaism is I'm a Jew and, or you know, any of the things that I'm passionate about, but I want to do. One is I do want to be in an environment in which I'm respected and I have an equal opportunity to be successful. And so I'm creating that every single day by putting my parameters out there and saying, this is who I am. I'm gay, Jewish, Chubby, you know, uh, now in my mid thirties, this is who I am. And, uh, now you can self select out of my world if you'd like. And you know, so be it. I think one of the, I think one of the challenges for all gay professional people is this idea that, um, you're going to be faced with a world that's hostile to you and your lifestyle and you know, um, but really it ends up being more quotidian than that.

Speaker 1:          01:52          I think when you've worked, especially in the corporate world, which I mostly issued in my, in my professional career. But when you're working in the professional world, most of that hassle factor of being gay is that you, uh, on Monday morning you come into the office and your friends are talking about their kids and their, you know, their spouse and what they did for the weekend and the golfing that they did. And if your lifestyle is not those things, if you're not a gay person with kids and a spouse and golfing and you're sort of forced to like interpret what part of your life the other person does or doesn't want to hear and what's contextually relevant and you know, what is or isn't going to make them uncomfortable. And I think, um, I think that's actually a complicated dance, um, at first and then over time what you realize is you gain traction on that.

Speaker 1:          02:35          So not being pollyanna. I am saying that I think single straight people have some of the same issues in a culture where, um, you're ran a lot of married people are married, people with children. There's a sort of expectation often that, uh, people who are married with children can go home at four o'clock because they have to attend to their kids. And of course who would say, no, you can't go pick your kids up from school. You know, we're as the single person or the person without kids. It doesn't get to do things. Um, and then I think it's more, I would like a family status equality, fairness issue than it is a sexuality fairness and equality issue. And so a lot of, so to me, my observation has been that most issues related to sexuality in the workplace are actually issues of family status and gender and rather than sexuality strictly speaking.

Speaker 1:          03:19          And that, um, once you put those things into context, then there's a layer of certainly of like explicitly sexuality related issues. Um, but most of it is about family status and gender. I will say one thing though, which is I have the benefit of being an entrepreneur and, um, the benefit of living in, you know, in the technology business and the games industry and, and being an entrepreneur in those environments. And so in those, in the context of entrepreneurship and technology and, and the games industry, um, of course I can be out. I mean, it's my company. So in that way I can build a corporate culture that matches the environment that I want to work in and are built with people who I respect and who respect me and who I feel comfortable with and with whom I want to come into work every single day and enjoy the, you know, basically the relationship that I'm building with them.

Speaker 1:          04:10          You know, and that's a degree of control that I don't have in many other aspects of being an entrepreneur. But I certainly do in terms of who gets hired to work at my company. And, um, that's definitely one thing that's a rewarding about being an entrepreneur that you don't necessarily get when you work in the corporate world. So I appreciate it if you're, uh, you know, if you're just starting out in your career and you want to go work at, you know, some big tech finance company or the Department of defense or something crazy like that, then your considerations are probably different from mine. But I, I try to live a, I work so much. I try to integrate my life as much as possible so that I can enjoy all aspects of it.
