Speaker 1:          00:07          I'm not sure it says a lot. Uh, I think the Clinton years, we're a, we're a mistakes for America that they took us in the wrong direction. I think President Bush has been a strong leader, has stood up for improving education, for improving our Medicare system and standing up against a violet terror throughout the world. Uh, I respect the president and his integrity.
