Speaker 2:          00:13          I have no idea. No particular event comes to my mind or whatever. It's certainly true that in the post World War Two era when I was. I was born in 1939, so you can do the math, excuse me. Lots of stuff was happening in, in, in, in New York City. The United Nations was being built. Lever House was being built. I remember seeing lever has when it was nearing completion for the first time because my dentist office was down the block, so to speak, things that you could see at the museum of Modern Art, the various houses that were built in the garden. I went to all of them with my parents. Took me to the and so let's say subliminally that interested me. I did have a teacher in a junior high school and she was the art teacher or an art teacher and her brother was a city planner and when I expressed my interests, I suppose he. She connected me to the brother who was living in Cleveland as I recall. So it was just the fact that there was somebody out there might be interested in what I was doing, making little drawings.
