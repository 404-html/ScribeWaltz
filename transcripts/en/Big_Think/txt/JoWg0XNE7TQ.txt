Speaker 1:          00:06          In the late 1920, a young man outside of Tampa in Florida picked up an ax and hacked his family to death. His name is Victor Lacarta. At that point, cannabis was not illegal in the United States and a man called Harry anslinger. I'd taken over the Department of Alcohol Prohibition, Justice, Alcohol prohibition was ending, so you inherited this huge government department that's just lost the war and alcohol. It's riddled with corruption and he wants to keep it going. He had previously said that cannabis was not dangerous, shouldn't worry about it. He's suddenly decided that cannabis was the most evil. Literally, this is his words, the most evil drug in the world. He said, I'm much worse than heroin. He said, he said, if if Frankenstein's monster mutt cannabis on the staircase that would drop dead or fried, and he latched onto the case of Victor Lacarta with the help of the kind of Fox News of his day, which was called the hearst newspapers.

Speaker 1:          01:01          He announced that Victor Lacarta had smoked cannabis. That's why he'd hacked his family to death with an ax, and this is what will happen if we allow cannabis to spread and we need to ban and prohibit cannabis. It was in the wake of that case that cannabis is band. Years later, somebody goes back, a researcher where many years later, decades later, a researcher went back and looked at Victor Lacarta his files. There's no evidence even smoke cannabis. His family had been told he needs to be institutionalized the year before because it was severely mentally ill, but they decided to keep him at home. The origins of the war on drugs, which I wrote about in my book, chasing the scream. The first and last days of the war on drugs overwhelmingly looked like that. If you'd asked me when I started doing the research for chasing screen, why was cannabis band? I would have guessed they would have given the reasons then, but if you stop someone on the street now, they would give.

Speaker 1:          01:53          You know, we don't want kids to use drugs. We don't want people to become addicted. What's fascinating is that stuff just never, virtually never came up when they were banning cannabis, right? Or indeed the other drugs. It was overwhelmingly a kind of racial panic and absurd hysteria is about, about what was going to happen. Now, the one thing you can say in defense of the war on drugs in the world, cannabis in particular, is we've given it a fair shot, right? The United States has spent a trillion dollars a, it's imprisoned, um, more people than any other country in human history, including Stalin's Russia and China and it's destroyed whole countries like Columbia at the end of all that, we can't even keep drugs out of our prisons where we pay someone to walk around the perimeter the whole time, which gives you some idea of how well we're ever going to keep that out of the country with two, 3000 mile borders.

Speaker 1:          02:43          There is an alternative for how we can think about cannabis. There are places that have legalized cannabis and we can see the results. So I spent a lot of time in Colorado and Washington state actually spent time in places that have legalized other drugs. Heroin, for example. It's been legalized in Switzerland with extraordinary results. There have been zero overdose deaths on legal heroin in Switzerland in the more than 13 years since they, since they legalized. But with cannabis specifically, again, we can see the results. When you banned cannabis, several things happen. The first thing that happens is it you will have noticed it does not disappear. It's transferred from licensed legal businesses to armed criminal gangsters. Those armed criminal gangsters have to operate differently to a licensed business. So you know, you will have noticed the head of Budweiser does not go and shoot the head of Heineken in the face, right?

Speaker 1:          03:32          Your local liquor store does not send people to go and stab people in the local bar. Right, exactly. That happened at the alcohol prohibition, right? I mean exactly that and it ended the day alcohol prohibition ended. Why? Because when you band drugs, they have to operate in an illegal market where there's no, and I learned this from lots of drug dealers. I spent time with the chasing the scream, not just for fun, and there was some funding as well. Um, the, the illegal market can only operate through violence, right? You have no recourse to the Lord. You're, if, if, if I go out of here now and I tried to steal a bottle of vodka, you know, the liquor store, we'll call the cops. The cops will come and take me away. So there's no need for that liquor store to be violent, to be intimidating if I go out of here now and try to steal a bag of weed from the people who sell it, not so far away, they can't call the cops.

Speaker 1:          04:19          The cops would come and arrest them. They have to fight me now. You don't want to be having a fight everyday if you're a dealer. So you got to establish a reputation for being so frightening that people wouldn't be so stupid as to come and fight yet. Right? So this is the ratchet effect you get with prohibition. You create a market that can only be regulated by violence and where there is actually a premium on being the most violent person and the most intimidating person when you have to be violent, intimidating to protect your market. Now when you legalize that goes away immediately. That ended. Whereas Al Capone, it does anyone even know the head of Smirnoff's name, right? Everyone watching this knows Al Capone's name. I bet nobody watching this knows the head of smirnoff's name. What changed? It's not the drug, it's the fact that it went from being illegal and therefore controlled by gangsters to legal and being controlled by legal and licensed businesses.

Speaker 1:          05:04          The second thing that happens, which is a slightly more wonky point but I think is really interesting and important, is that milder forms of the drug disappeared. So you often get. People say, well, we can't legalize cannabis because the cannabis people use today isn't the cannabis people used it in the 19 sixties, right? It's much stronger. It's things like skunk [inaudible] skunk. That's true, and it's entirely the product about cannabis prohibition. You want to understand why I got into dancing just before alcohol was banned in the United States, most popular drinks by far were beer and wine. After alcohol is legalized. Again, most popular drinks by far were beer and wine. Is there a main today and when alcohol was banned, you couldn't get hold of barrel wine anywhere. Most popular drinks where whiskey and Moonshine, you think, well, why is that? Why we're banning a drug change?

Speaker 1:          05:48          The form of the drug is kind of rather prosaic reason, and actually we had to smuggle enough. You know, alcohol for your local bar from the Mexican border or the Canadian border, right? If we fill our wagon with a beer, we'll get drink for 100 people. If we fill our wagon with whiskey, will get drink for thousands of people. When you ban drugs, there's suddenly a premium on getting the biggest possible kick into the smallest possible space because it's got to be smuggled, right? It's got to be transported in secret. This happens with all drugs. This is what I kind of. It's become. It's become much more potent, most popular form of consuming cocaine prior to it being banned was intake coca tea, and you may remember a drink called Coca Cola that really to contain exactly what it sounds like, they don't exist anymore. Went to ever hear about Coker Tea, right?

Speaker 1:          06:37          Coca Cola exists, but it's not what it was. Obviously, the most popular way of consuming opiods by far was a drink called laudanum and something called Mrs winslow soothing syrup. That was a small trace of opiates, right? Again, they disappear. Most popular form becomes heroin when you ban a drug, only the most extreme forms of that drugs have become available now. Now, most people who smoke cannabis don't want skunk, right? Just like if I go into bar around the corner from here today, probably very few people are can be drinking vodka and no one's going to be drinking absinthe, right? If you're concerned about the more extreme forms of the drug, which I think we should be with cannabis because there is, it's not a huge relationship, but there's some relationship with dysfunctional behavior. Then you want to pay a really high premium on getting milder forms of the drug available, so almost all the users he wanted.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Right. So that's another effect that happens with legalization and you know, one of the things that, so moving everywhere I went, but they've moved beyond the war on drugs from Portugal where they decriminalized all drugs to Switzerland where they legalized heroin addicts to Erg. Why and Washington and Colorado where they legalized cannabis. The pattern was always the same. It is super controversial at first and understandably, people are really worried and then they see the effects. It's not a silver bullet. There's still problems, but there's such a significant improvement that the support massively rises. So 55 percent of people in Colorado voted to legalize in 2015 today. Seventy percent of people support it. Governor Hickenlooper who opposed it now says it works really well. They've had a huge increase in tax revenue. I interviewed one former police officer. He told me a story about this that really stayed with me one day in the seventies.

Speaker 1:          08:18          He was staking out a dealer in a car park in Wayne, New Jersey in plain clothes, and a kid came up to him and said, hey, Mr, where you go into that liquor store and buy me some bs. I'm not allowed to until young. It was like a 12 year old or something, and he said, no, get out of here. What are you talking about? Get out of here. So the kid walked over to the drug dealer and bought some drugs from him instead. And he had this kind of epiphany. He's like, oh, actually, legalization, illegal regulated system puts a barrier between children and drugs that does not currently exist. If you're a parent who doesn't want your child to smoke cannabis, and if you're a parent, you shouldn't because there is evidence that it can impair development. Um, for teenagers, you want to put a really high premium on getting cannabis out of the hands of armed criminal gangs.

Speaker 1:          09:05          You don't care whether the customers are 13, 30 or 80 and getting into the hands of licensed legal, regulated businesses who have something to lose. This is why in Colorado all the research shows that's been a really significant fall in cartel and organized crime activities. They legalized. There's been a fallen teenagers using. It was already quite low, but it's fallen. There's been a massive increase in tax revenue. You know, it's not perfect. There were some things I would have tweaked in the Colorado legalization, but you know, you can tweak a legal market, wouldn't have any power over an illegal market. There's nothing we can do about it. Right? At some point, the president of Switzerland, Ruth Dreifuss, when she made the case to the threats, people for legalizing heroin, it. She's one of the great heroes I've ever met in my life. She explained to them, you know, when you hear the word legalization is picture like anarchy and chaos. What we have now is anarchy and chaos. You have unknown criminals selling unknown chemicals to unknown drug users. All in the dark, all filled with violence, right? Legalization is the way we restore order to this chaos. At some point we have to look at the results. It's worked incredibly well, and let's look at the places that are maintaining a criminal warrant cannabis. How's that working out for you?
