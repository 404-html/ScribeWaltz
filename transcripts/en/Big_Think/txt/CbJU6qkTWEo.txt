Speaker 1:          00:08          I think I could speak for all the World Bank employees. It's a, it's a job that is a very, it gets, it grabs you really strongly and you, you do get up early in the morning and you look forward to the day are very interesting work because what could be more interesting than to work on some hundred and 50 countries on the boat, a hundred sectors, uh, and on global issues, uh, from such an outpost as the World Bank, which is owned by 195 countries of the world and from which you do look at the world as if it was a whole planet. Uh, not from the country point of view but from a sort of overall global point of view. So it's a very interesting job to be in and you get to learn a lot of things about a lot of countries and a lot of people and the culture of the institutions is interesting.

Speaker 1:          01:03          It's one where there are 150 or 60 nationalities in the house and you never think about the nationality of your colleagues. You forget about it. Everyone has the same jargon. And codewords and you forget that someone is Italian or Bangladeshi or Tanzania. And so it is a little bit, it has the culture of the world as I would wish it to have. I would wish to world had that sort of culture one day. Uh, it's beyond the Knight Nation State and the nationality culture. It's sort of one level above. And that also makes it very fascinating. And the third thing that, uh, had me taking at the World Bank, it's very libertarian institution. There was a lot of room for debates on what worked and what didn't work. They were a lot of arguments, academic arguments or even practical arguments one way or the other. And you could do many things. And I did in my time, uh, I pioneered many new things and I was never whistled back in that way. That was part of the reasons why I saw like the institution
