Speaker 1:          00:07          A lot better than a lot of people thought I was going to start with that. It is a rather surprising to me in some ways that it's done this well this long because I was taught at the University of Chicago and northwestern that it was terribly important for countries to have savings and to invest a lot in the future and that had a lot to do with how well they're doing. Well. America today has the lowest savings rate it has had in many, many years. At the national level. It's fallen dramatically from all 10, 11 percent of the GDP is, we call it down to one or two personal savings rates. Stunningly, I've gone from nine percent of our disposable income to a minus one percent and we become very gifted, a ardent robust to consumers and borrowers and savers. Now the big question is we become huge borrowers as a country with our very large deficits.

Speaker 1:          01:30          We become borrowers at the consumer level with very hard debt levels and a really lousy savings levels. And the big question I have about the American economy is not today, but it's how long we think we can continue because we've got some huge challenges that are coming. We have 78 million baby boomers twice the size of the current generation due to begin retiring next year. We have social security and Medicare that are programs that are where we made a lot of promises, but we haven't funded them and we've grossly misled. The American people was such a euphemisms as the social security trust fund. I argue it's oxymoron. It shouldn't be trusted and it's not funded because the money's already been spent and we haven't provided for those programs. We are getting to be fancy language. We have something called a current account deficit which measures are deaths. It's abroad, which is largely the trade depths. It's now twice as high as a percentage of the economy as it's ever been in America's history and we're borrowing and borrowing and becoming dysfunctionally and I think destructively, but depending on the long run on Chinese money, in Japanese money in Asian money and so forth and which they lend us money.

Speaker 1:          03:19          Funny thing about borrowing, you have to pay it back at some time and as a country we can't continue to borrow a seven percent of the whole economy, which is what we're borrowing now for very many years without looking like a very different America than we have now. So I think the economy today is in pretty good shape though, was getting pretty turbulent now with housing and housing is a wonderful example. I did quite a study about 18 months ago and that was simply astonished at the number of people who bought homes, no money down. It's called interest on me and then I was astonished that even though mortgage rates at the lowest level in 30 years, they've averaged around nine point seven percent or something like that and now they're like six people are not taking longterm fixed mortgages. About half of them are taking what are called adjustable rate mortgages.

Speaker 1:          04:33          Well one might say, gee, that's fine. If we have a lot of savings that we've stacked away and if we aren't borrowing very much for other purposes, that isn't true. We're borrowing more Maura's upset of her income than we have in many, many years. So now we've had this big blow out of the so called subprime mortgage market and today I hear on the press that housing prices are falling and so forth. What did we think was gonna happen? How are these loans going to get paid back if we don't have any savings are already heavily borrowed. So my concerns about the economy of this country are much more in the future and much more of our culture. We had become from one of the biggest savers and the world and saving remember as a metaphor for the future, uh, we've become the biggest consumers and borrowers in the world, which is kind of another way of saying, Dang, I want it all. I want it now and I don't want to give up anything and kind of to hell with the future. So I am a far more concerned with America's economic future 10, 15, 20 years from now than I am. What happens over the next months.

Speaker 2:          06:00          I am planning to

Speaker 1:          06:04          my, a from blackstone going public. A lot of it and it's quite a windfall and set up a what will turn out to be a very large foundation and because I've been boring people relentlessly for the last 20, 30 years about some of these problems, um, I'm going to take a number of these problems that are what I call undeniable, an unsustainable and yet politically untouchable because of the political culture we now live in where it's considered almost politically terminal ever asked anybody to give up anything or pay for anything and you know, I want more and more and more and I, I want it now. And to take these issues which I think are serious threat to America's future and uh, take those issues where there's a huge gap between what we should be doing and what we could be doing and what we are not doing.

Speaker 1:          07:18          And figure out how at the margin a major foundation might be able to make a difference. When I think of young people today and I think of what we're leaving them a 10, 15, 20 years from now, you remind me of that old, a joke in the philosophy class where the professor asks the students, which is worse, ignorance, ignorance or apathy, and some poor kid from the back of the class says, I don't know, and I don't care. Well, I think it's an interesting question. Is there an exciting way that we could get the young people to this country aware and their parents because I refused to believe that parents have suddenly become cold and indifferent to their own kids and grand computers. I think they've been deceived and a misinformed and disinfect and so forth, so we have a political system today, for example, where the elderly are unbelievably well represented.

Speaker 1:          08:33          The American Association of Retired Persons as 38 dues paying $38 million dues paying members. They write more, they lobby more, they call more and by and large it's not too unfair to say a lot of their programs are. We want more, even though by any standard, as I say, some of these challenges are unsustainable. We can't, we're not going to be able to meet the promises that we've made. So on the one hand we have these, this culture of our ethic of shared sacrifice being kind of a dirty word, not wanting to give up anything. We have political organizations who are dominant in representing one age group and the young people who were all about the future or somehow being slipped this huge check hidden check I might add for our free lunch and nobody seems to be doing anything about it. So I would like to gather together the student and the young leaders of this country and uh, take a day or two and say, try to give you the biggest best running around I can and half a dozen areas of the economy and fiscally and what the world looks like.

Speaker 1:          10:02          And then I want you to contemplate that because it's not my future. It's yours. I'm 81 years old. I Lord knows I don't need anything more. And ask you what are the best ways to do something about it and should we have an American Association of young people and their parents, for example, because until this democracy gets educated and get some form, which is the first requirement, and then get active and motivated. Not much is going to happen on these problems unless there's a huge crisis and it will be a very costly crisis when it hits. So that's a long winded answer how I feel about the economy. I I'm much more concerned about the longterm picture that I am over the next year or two or three.

Speaker 2:          10:59          My parents' generation, the greatest generation for

Speaker 1:          11:04          fought the most costly war in history. Costly in every sense of that word. They built international institutions, Marshall Plan and so forth, which was central to the world getting restored. They had gi bill or rights for all the returning veterans went to college. They rebuild the infrastructure of this country, but they didn't ask me to pay for it. They paid for it because they were willing to invest in the future and that meant saving. And that meant consuming less. I tell these university audiences,

Speaker 1:          11:50          I think a careful study of your sociologist, of your social psychologists, have your political scientists of your economists have your historians and say, what was it during those early times and where more Americans than I'm afraid today had a clear sense of the future and a responsibility for it and what led us to this notion, I'm going to grab what I can and the government owes me this and the government owes me that and a kind of to hell with other people or to hell with the future to hell with who and how we're going to pay for all this. Now, why did that come about? What led to this boomer mentality? You know, about? I wanted it all. I got to enjoy it. And uh, I have a dear friend who is there an aspect of the medical profession. He's kind of complaining that it's not a,

Speaker 3:          12:57          Hey, I'm

Speaker 1:          12:59          millionaire or mold omitted in her or whatever.

Speaker 1:          13:04          And I said, well, you know, one way people become millionaires is they save and they invest, but he's got to have a smaller plane and he flies on the weekend. Is he points out to me is not a jet, and I said, well, I understand I don't have a jet either, but, and Oh, um, you know, I need to have fun because I worked so hard all week and I need a porsche car, you know, so forth. And that is the boomer mentality that we're kind of dealing with here and I don't really know what lead from saving and investing into the future, which consoling and borrowing. Now, uh, did America get a disenchanted by the Vietnam war? The tore this country apart? Did we get torn apart by the fascination of presidents and presidents, brothers and Martin Luther King and riots in the streets? And uh, uh, I was gonna say I was working on this problem in Chicago is a terrifying side to say. And then somehow the bonds that united us in Helios lead to the current situation. I'm not sure, but I've never seen a time when there is so much bitterness and partisanship and paralysis as we have today in our government. I mean, nothing went through areas or areas where

Speaker 1:          14:54          the Republican leadership in the democratic leadership are united for a much longer larger cause, namely the nation's interest. We've had very little of that recently. So I'm putting. I don't know what all the reasons are. I just know there's been a, a really major shift. I think if I may, just to insult your medium, it entirely possible that television has had its impact. For example, I used to watch my children, I admire there wasn't television and they turn on the TV and pounded into their heads. Here's this toy. They had a habit, there's the stress. They gotta have this and we've developed a kind of a indulgent instinct, gratification consumption, large s, uh, that has become part of our culture. And I don't, I, I, I don't know all the reasons for it, but certainly the presence of such an effective medium and television is probably one of the, uh.
