Speaker 1:          00:10          Well, it was incredibly unjust because they had a hundred to one ratio. For example, if you had a one gram of cocaine powder, uh, if you had 100th the amount of crack cocaine, that those would be considered equal. And I think that crack cocaine typically has been associated with, uh, communities that are lower income, poor people. Whereas, you know, at, uh, you know, parties in Aspen, people aren't smoking crack. So it did have a, a horror, horrific effect. Um, on population. I do federal criminal work and I've seen a number of, uh, young people with face horrific sentencing because of, uh, their involvement with the crack cocaine, maybe on a very superficial level, but because of the way the sentencing guidelines were structured, there is no such thing as a small case. Well, I mean, they would have to have a hundred times as much as the equivalent amount of crack. And from what I've learned that, uh, to convert powder cocaine to crack, it's a one to one basis. So if you were in the federal system, it's insidious enough that if there was proof that you intended to convert, say 50 grams of powder into 50 grams of crack, it would be treated at the hundred to one ratio.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Well, I dunno if anybody anybody's destined to be to for the criminal justice system, but if you grow up in an area of low income where, uh, where most many people are not working, where there is, there's not much employment where there's not a lot of, uh, guidance. Inevitably, uh, people, there are a lot of opportunities to become involved in criminal activity. Also in the, uh, in the lower income communities, people are more, much more likely to resolve disputes simply by dialing nine one one. And police are more predisposed to just simply arresting people rather than trying to resolve an issue or see if the issue really requires an arrest. So you see a tremendous amount of people that in other communities there wouldn't have been the opportunity to get in crime. Uh, things that they do would not have been treated as a crime. Um, but for the fact that that's the way that, uh, the police handle things, people and people are very,

Speaker 3:          03:00          uh, it's very easy to dial nine one one to resolve a problem. Well, again, I think it's a,

Speaker 1:          03:15          the funding, the funding programs to, to, uh, help addiction education programs to stop people from becoming involved in a substance, you know, substance abuse situations, job training, people that are working are far less likely to be come involved, uh, in crime. They don't have to, to take things too to support themselves. So I think a lot of money would be better spent before people get into the criminal justice system. Then now we, now we spend the most amount of money. And when I say we, I'm talking about government in, in building presence to simply warehouse people. And that's why, uh, this country has more people in jail than any other, yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:07          Per capita than any country in the world. And that's, that's pretty horrific. Well, I still am loath to sort of to say that

Speaker 1:          04:23          someone that's committed a crime, even if they've gone to prison, that they're going to be like anyone else because they're still individuals. So I think it really depends. Um, there's no rehabilitation as far as rehabilitation education. Uh, very little is spent on that. Most of the money for corrections is spent on, uh, protection and, uh, it really making sure people don't escape, don't have engage in violence with other inmates. But there's not a lot done to see that when people get out that they won't repeat those behaviors. But I still think it depends on the individual. If they're coming out and they have a supportive family, uh, they probably have a shot. If they're coming out to nothing and, and they had an extensive criminal history beforehand and they're going back to the neighborhood where they've gotten arrested and prosecuted

Speaker 3:          05:25          over and over again. I think there's a little hope that they're going to turn their entire life around. I think towards if, uh, if towards the end of people

Speaker 1:          05:40          sentence, I know in, in, in the federal system, depending on what crime you were convicted of, they release people to halfway houses, uh, and conditionally released people. So they get some sort of job skills or trading. There has to be something other than sitting in a cell for 20 years. And then on the day that your schedule of the release, they simply open the door for you and give you your clothes that you came in with. If there's, uh, one would hope that towards the end of sentencing, some effort is made to, to match that individual up with some sort of preparation for the world outside cause the world. Not only is it different from being in, uh, from their experience in being incarcerated, but the world is different from when they went in.

Speaker 2:          06:40          Yeah.
