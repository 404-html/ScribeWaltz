Speaker 1:          00:08          I think the locavore movement is brilliant and it all makes perfect sense because we went from kind of in the fifties and sixties in America it was all about convenience and anytime you cooked it was French food and then in the seventies and eighties it was this explosion of world cuisines and we learned about Mexican and not just Mexican but well hawkin and food from Veracruz and we learned about Italian food and Italian food food, but food from Ramon Emilia Romano and from the glorious. So, um, there's been this evolution of knowledge and sophistication and it's all kind of come back down into where the food from, where you're from. And even at the local board term has only been coined two years ago in San Francisco. Um, it makes a lot of sense. I mean, essentially what it is, is a food will have movement that says you should really, your diet should really be consisting of food that has been harvested or process from within 100 mile radius of your home.

Speaker 1:          01:11          And that makes a lot of sense because you're sustaining the farmers. You're eating food that is as nutrient rich as possible. You are contributing to the greening of the planets by doing this and you're helping small businesses grow in your area. So those are all very important points and hopefully the food is organic. Hopefully it's been harvested, are processed in a really healthy green way. You are really thinking globally and acting locally. I mean it really is kind of the fruition of that concept which was, you know, the in the last 10 years so that you're really helping sustain your area and the people that live within your radius. So to me it makes a lot of sense and it's the way that we, we lived all those years ago and it, in terms of health, it makes the most sense for sure because what it does is it forces you to eat in a much more healthy manner.
