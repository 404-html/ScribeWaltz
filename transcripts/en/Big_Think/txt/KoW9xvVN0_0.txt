Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          no, I think we had to start from the fact, you know, somebody once said to me, you're, I didn't, I didn't march in the sixties so that men could sleep together. And I was like, well, you know, that's the right mack is byard Rustin had that held down like the man who planned the march on Washington was, was gay, was known to be gay, um, and, and that was okay with Dr King and it was okay with Julian bond and John Lewis then. And it's, it's okay now. I mean, I only regrets it, but by residents, they still isn't with us planning, planning, planning marches. So I think we have to start from the premise that gay people are part of the NAACP. Gay people are part of the social justice movement that gay, black people in particular, um, you know, live both of those identities as we all live, you know, multiple identities.

Speaker 2:          00:51          You know, the, the Naacp for that reason has always been quick to recognize, uh, you know, across a whole range of issues that are common interests of black people as black people, you know, or multiple identities as black people and gay people as gay people. There are multiple shades of colors. I mean, for instance, issues of police brutality, employment discrimination, hate crimes. We've been there side by side, fighting on again and again. Uh, we set a big victory. The Matthew Shepard, James Byrd, bill at the NAACP, but ads in Texas to promote and really to beat up on then governor about to become President Bush for his lack of support 10 years ago. And we're out there now in the employment nondiscrimination act and we're out there now in Uganda. No, I mean we, we, we hate the definitely because it's the death penalty, but we also, uh, you know, we hate it all the more when you say that, that, that you want to make being a member of a minority group, any minority group, the reason that you get the death penalty and that's what they're trying to do in Uganda, they're trying to actually make being gay, uh, a crime punishable by death.

Speaker 2:          02:02          The, where there has been distanced recently has been between religious communities in general and the Movement for marriage equality and the NAACP has a very religious base and people who want to see movement on that issue of people wanting to feel like people want to see more blacks in the Republican Party. A need to invest in outreach, need to really say, you know, what that constituency as a priority and, and I'm gonna, you know, make it my business to make sure that we reach out to that consumer constituency on their terms in the way that's most effective. That's what any good organizer does. That's what I do for the issues that I'm pushing the, um, with that said, Julian Bond, for instance, our, our, our past chair is very outspoken in support. Um, I've let it be known that I personally support marriage equality. My brother, the man who is closer to me than any man on this planet, uh, my best friend since I was six years old, we started six months and, and his mom celebrated mother's Day with my mom and, and his family lived with us off and on for a third of my life.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Um, is gay, is HIV positive, is a on again, off again, homeless. I've, I've spent many a lot of money trying to keep them from being homeless, but sometimes people just, you know, issues in their life that you, that, that no dollar can overcome. Um, so it's very personal for a lot of us I guess is what I'm saying. But we're a democratic organization at the end of the day and that means that we tend to be on the front edge of some issues and we tend to lag behind on others and we'd never get there until consensus as bill. And that's why I say to folks, look, if you'd want to see the naacp even more active than we have been and we've been active in California, a folks there in California voted to oppose prop eight and they, and they rolled out all the stops to oppose it.

Speaker 2:          03:54          The National Office signed onto the lawsuit to invalidate probate because we were able to get consensus on the principle that I'm a simple majority vote, should not be able to trump a court's finding of a fundamental right. And that's a threat to whole range of rights, including the right to marry. Um, but also, I mean, you know, the right to, to, to, uh, be treated with respect in the workplace and not discriminate against in the workplace. For instance. Apparently now it can be put up to a vote in California. So, um, you know, we, we have been involved, you know, gay people who have been involved in the naacp for a long time. The Naacp has been supportive abroad civil human rights agenda in this country, including, uh, uh, rights for gay and lesbian people for a long time. Um, and, and we have many, many of our most outspoken leaders are, are very outspoken on the issue of marriage equality and many are outspoken against it. And, uh, like any other democratic organization and trade union, what, what, what have you, it's being worked through. And the way that one side wins or the other is that they decide that, that they want the membership of the Naacp to be supportive of this one particular part of the agenda more than the other side does. And, and right now it seems to be a bit of a tossup.
