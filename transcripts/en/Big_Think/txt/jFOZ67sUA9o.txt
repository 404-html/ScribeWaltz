Speaker 1:          00:09          The medical model that might begin to talk about this problem based model is, is really restricted. It, it's very powerful and it helps us, but, but it only takes us so far. The fundamental nature of dying is not medical, it's personal. And so, you know, dying cannot be encompassed by a set of medical problems and a set of diagnoses and treatments. Um, so while we, while we can, can remain disease focused, um, for as long as it makes sense, we also have to attend to the personal aspects of dying of people. You know, the, the, what you lose and dying in the hospital many times is you lose that personal time. Your, your, your space is not your own people walk in and out. Um, you don't have the sort of privacy or intimacy with family. Beyond that though we stayed within that medical model.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Everybody who walks in your room or interacts with you are talking to you about medical problems. They will continue to conscript your attention to the lab tests and the next, uh, scans and the next treatments and the drugs and your vital signs and all of that. Um, instead of attending to the personal, they actually conscript your time and energy for the medical, the best end of life care that I know of through modeled by hospice programs and, and the best palliative care programs still does all the medical stuff, but it's subordinated to the personal. It's, it's, you know, in hospice care, we make appointments to see you and your family and not the other way around. We're coming to your home. We are, um, uh, explicitly acknowledging the importance of Interactions, um, of your privacy and intimacy. And beyond that we're even offering some help, some guidance that may be a value to you in this area of, of human interaction.

Speaker 1:          02:19          I would call life completion in life closure, you know, which again, in a problem based medical model doesn't even exist. It's not their quality of life and quality of life completion really exists in a, in a developmental model that really honors the, the breadth of human life for the person and family, but, but not in a problem based model. So even the very best of of a problem based medicine and including attention to symptoms in the like tends not to see those personal experiences of completing one's affairs, fiscal and legal and project related affairs, but also their personal affairs, their, their relationships and their explorations of the own meaning and significance of their own life, their relationship to something larger than themselves. That stuff that's not abstract for people who know that, that their life is measured in weeks or days. It's, it's very tangible.
