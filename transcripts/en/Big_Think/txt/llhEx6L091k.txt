Speaker 1:          00:02          There are the beginnings of an intellectual revulsion at, at what conservatives, what has been done to conservatism as a governing philosophy in America. Um, and I think one of the roles of the day, the dishes now trying to, to play is to be a place where those voices can be, can be brought to a wider audience. So I think of Bruce Bartlett who along with me in the early part of the Bush administration, called them out on that fiscal irresponsibility is a voice that I'm very happy to, to, to keep bringing. I think a much later, someone like David Frum has come to that recognition even though I think we're still going to disagree about foreign policy. I think, um, there are some libertarian voices that are out there. Um, and I think a younger generation of reasoned people I think of, I think of people like Damon linker.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Um, uh, there are, there are people out there. Uh, unfortunately what's happened in Washington and more generally is that the conservative movement is bankrolled by certain large donors and with certain overwhelming interests. Um, and they police the discourse with a ferocity and a lockstep mentality that has frozen conservatism as a, as a, as a philosophy in place. Um, and turned it into an ideology that kind of ever change, um, or Alijah it with such fundamentalist concepts that there can be no real conservative dialogue because dialogue is not what fundamentalism is about. Uh, and the price of lip simply existing as a, a conservative in Washington to be in good standing is to obey the dictates of whichever this constellation of donors and organizations from heritage to Aei, um, to even something like pajamas media, which is apparently financed by people who are also financing West Bank settlements.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Um, is if, if you stray, you are expelled. And then also thoroughly demonized. So intellectually we are, you know, the blogosphere allows these kinds of ideas to percolate and I mean kind of Fritos door for example, is a young conservative, uh, whom I've brought on specifically with the mandate of because find and courage let us bring to light young writers right of center who are not yet, have not been yet basically bought by this establishment. And then coerced to certain positions. Daniel Larson is another person. Now these people don't normally agree by any means. That's the point. I mean, but they do not, they, they have acknowledged that conservatism in the past 10, 15, 20 years.

Speaker 1:          03:12          It's not that there was a great period of pure, great conservatives and we've never had this, some of these populist, xenophobic, racist, bigoted strains. It's that that was always there. Um, it is that there was also a lot of good stuff there that we were responding to contingent situations such as the collapse of the social democracy model in the 1970s and a really smart critique of the welfare state. And a really, I think, critical insight into how one defeats solving communism. What's, what's happened is that all that stuff has slowly been marginalized and well, the worst has come to the surface. Um, and that, that won't change overnight. And I think from everything we're seeing talk radio and, uh, these, I think essentially corrupting institutions in Washington are turning conservatism into something that really very creepy, but also emotionally and psychically powerful for people. So all you do is all you can do is is write books, write articles, write blogs that articulate

Speaker 2:          04:23          what you believe.
