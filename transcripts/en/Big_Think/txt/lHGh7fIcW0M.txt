Speaker 1:          00:00          I think one of the most important findings in my book and my research is that innovator is fundamentally misunderstand human capital as an asset, human capital, as a resource. The majority of organizations that want to innovate, say we need to get innovators, we need to improve the capabilities and competencies of our employees. We need to hire people who are willing to take a chance, et cetera. It's such and be innovative and the whole notion of, you know, our competitive advantage in this post industrial era is that we have better human capital than our competitors. You know, Google has better people than IBM has better people than apple has better people than Amazon and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I submit that's the exact wrong way to look at it. Not that it's wrong in the sense of false but wrong in the way of being incomplete.

Speaker 1:          00:50          What about your customers? Human capital. What about your clients? Human capital, the Good Duncan experiment, the thought experiment I want people to get very, very serious consideration to is what if we stopped thinking of innovation as something that's new and valuable that we market and sell, and what if we start thinking about innovation as an investment in the human capital capabilities and competencies of our customers? Yes, Henry Ford transformed the factory production system with mass production of the automobile, the model t, the model a, etc. And everybody celebrates that as a milestone in business history, I submit that economic historians, business historians, marketers miss the essential point. Henry ford didn't just enAble the mass production of automobiles. He facilitated the mass creation of the human capital of driving. everybody drives. It's an asset. It transforms markets. It transforms individual and organizational capabilities. Why do we not spend as much time focusing on the human capital and adding value to the human capital of our customers and our clients as opposed to our employees.

Speaker 1:          02:16          I think that's the essential innovation takeaway. How do our innovations transform the human capital of our customers, not just the human capital of the people who work for us and with us. The reason why I came up with a design horistic making customers better makes better customers is because I wanted to help innovative organizations filter and prioritize their innovation investments. it's not enough to make your customer better if you don't reap the benefits of that investment. Conversely, if we're just making it better customer, that's exploitation, so what you're trying to do is align an innovation investment that makes your customer measurably better in some way that matters to that customer in some ways that matters for that client, but at the same time, at the same time, you're making that customer more valuable to themselves. you're making them more valuable to you by making them a better customer. You're making them a better customer for you. Making customers better makes better customers.
