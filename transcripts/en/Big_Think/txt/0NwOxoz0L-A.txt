Speaker 1:          00:12          I hate interviewing people because they very rarely level with you, and so although it would be interesting to sit down with Joseph Stalin and say on earth, did you delude yourself about Nazi plans for the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and nearly destroy your own country? I don't think he would tell me the truth on balance. As an historian, I've always chosen the dead over the living for the very good reason that they're. That letters and diaries are far prefer to what they might have told me in an interview. So if you forced my hand, I'd probably. I would probably like to spend some time with Stalin even though he was probably the most frightening man of the 20th century. Most people who've spent time with him were filled with fear through throughout. Still, it would be a. It would be a fascinating experience.
