Speaker 1:          00:10          Globally, I think we are not taking advantage of our ability to create, um, multi nation, multilateral alliances, I think even on a smaller scale than nations and we're not doing enough to combat global warming. We're not doing enough to educate people who are incredibly talented in this world. We're not doing enough to deliver healthcare to infants and children and women who are, um, again, wanting to be enterprising around the world. Those are the, the issues that we're not addressing, but there's one underlying cause of are not addressing that, I believe, which is not taking advantage of how we can come together despite our differences and deliberate and decide to do good. We need more institutions that bring us together in civil but robust ways to do, to do good in the world as a great constitutional democracy should be at the center of the democracies of the world. Working multilaterally to bring more peace and democracy and economic wellbeing to the Group of Democracies that are ready, agree that democracy is a good thing. And to those non democratic countries where we can act multilaterally rather than unilaterally. We're not doing that. Were at a depaul in Iraq right now, I don't have the formula for digging us out of it, but when you're in a depo, you don't keep digging

Speaker 1:          02:22          individually. We should each use our talents to a lot with other people, not necessarily people and ideally not people who are just like us, but to ally with other people to do some good in the world. That means whether it we should be educating kids who otherwise wouldn't get education. We should be figuring out ways of decreasing carbon emissions, if that's what we have the talent and the opportunity to do. We should be delivering healthcare, um, to people not as individuals, but as collectivities and not depending too much on our government for doing it because a dependence citizenry is asking for trouble. We have to take initiatives all over and I would say first and foremost, we have to begin locally. That is the idea that we would know how to save the world without doing some good in our own community is a form of Hubris and it's a form of Hubris that's brought a lot of damage to the world.
