Speaker 1:          00:06          I think it's a mix of both and I think that that represents the future of what the mixed capitalism kind of model is. The State Ism that Europe has always practiced, where corporations and the government are very much in collusion. And what Asia has learned to do and does itself at Korea and Japan and China are doing is something that basically if you take European economies and Asian economies together, it puts us in the minority of players who have been practicing real, genuine, free market sort of practices and economics in the last decades. So I think we're going to learn to do things their way rather than vice versa. That speaks to a broader critique of globalization, which is that we don't be, countries don't want to have unmanaged, unfettered globalization. They want to regulate, uh, they want to have capital controls. They want to direct and channel foreign investment in certain ways, uh, to serve their own national needs and to build their infrastructure and so forth. Um, that is the model that is prevailing now in Asia because it's proved to have great payoffs. Whereas the free market model is what is blamed correctly or incorrectly for the Asian financial crisis.
