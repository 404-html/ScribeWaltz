Speaker 1:          00:08          We are shaped by group level of selection processes so that we can be like bees in a hive. Um, we are not just primates. We evolved to fight it out with other primates. Uh, we are part way through a major transition evolutionary history that allows us to be temporarily like bees in a hive. We see this after a attacks. We saw it after nine 11. We can come together our propensity to find meaning, even though it may have evolved from simpler cognitive mechanisms as Richard Dawkins and others maintain. Um, I believe that our ability to find connections to see connections in the stars. If we look up at the sky, we see stories about people wandering around and going on missions. Um, I believe that our ability to find connections and meaning helps us merge together into groups, uh, that can function as one. Um, so this is part of the psychology that allows us to create these emergent super organisms, at least temporarily. Um, anyone who's ever been in part of being in a chorus or band or played a team sport or been initiated into a fraternity, knows the joy is the ecstasy of losing yourself in part of a larger group. I think this is the next frontier for psychology and for the social sciences is understanding that we are not radical individuals. We are actually in part bees in a hive, but we don't live that way. And that's the reason for as much,

Speaker 2:          01:27          right?

Speaker 1:          01:34          We are deeply and profoundly confirmation secrets not truth seekers. The most important rule in psychology is that thinking is for doing. Now there are some people whose task it is to find the truth. So you might think they would use thinking to find the truth. And there are some philosophers I think who are very open minded. There are some, uh, but for the most part, philosophers are human beings too. Uh, and they use reasoning to reach the conclusion that they find a minute, uh, amenable or conducive. Um, um, you have to look back at the divisions of the mind and realize that our language ability, our ability to think in words, did not come about so that we could figure things out. Language came about to communicate and especially to influence. We use reasoning to influence others, to manage our reputation to, to, to work out well, what will people think of me if I do this?

Speaker 1:          02:23          And is that person trying to cheat me? We use reasoning, uh, uh, in a machiavellian way. Quite often. Um, we are capable of using it to find the truth when we don't care about the truth. And this is why the natural sciences do such a good job. They can really reason their way to the conclusion offered by the data and the social sciences. We have a big problem. Almost all of us are liberal, not in economics, but in psychology, sociology, anthropology, almost all of us are liberal. So we reasoned our way to conclusions we want to reach, which are liberal conclusions. Um, and this makes it very hard for us to understand society, religion, politics,

Speaker 2:          02:57          knowledge. Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:04          The basic personality trait is that predicts ideology best is openness to experience. This is just a fact about the distribution of personality types. Just as some people are extroverted, some introverted, it's always going to be the case as part of a genetic shuffle. But some people just like novelty variety and diversity, other people like what's familiar. Um, I'm really glad it's this way. Uh, we need in any community we need people of both types. What happens now that we have so much geographic mobility is the people who are high in openness to experience can't stand to live in small towns. They all moved to New York and San Francisco and Boston create communities that are very high in openness to experience in which there is no moral diversity, uh, whereas other people who are born low and more on openness to experience and move out. Um, so we now get geographic and social clustering where we only have to deal with people who are like us.

Speaker 1:          03:53          Um, the food is really, really good where we liberals live because we like ethnic foods. We like variety in the more conservative parts of the country. It seems like all the restaurants are applebee's because they don't like bright in diversity, uh, that much. So this basic personality trait, um, drives so much else that happens and leads us to cluster into groups. It used to be that at least if you were born in one place, you were likely to stay, that most people stayed and you associated with people who were near you. But we're often different from you. Not Anymore. Now we've got lots of, of racial and ethnic diversity. That's great. But we've been able to purchase it at the cost of almost no model diversity.

Speaker 1:          04:36          The data suggests that Americans are among the happiest people in the world. Um, uh, it's the scandinavians also do extremely well on that. Um, the most important thing to realize for those who doubt that those who doubt that Americans are happy is to realize that happiness is really local. Um, our society is screwed up in a lot of ways. Uh, we have a lot of poverty. We have a lot of injustice. We have a broken political system, um, and some of that matters for happiness. But for the most part, our happiness comes from our local environment, from our relationships, from having control over our lives. Um, I do think the data suggests that, uh, freedom is good for people. Uh, up to a point. Um, mobility and diversity are not so good for people. Uh, they do, uh, they do make us trust our neighbors less. Uh, so anything that fosters strong relationships and stable, a stable, a healthy, cohesive communities is generally good for us. Um, but anything that fosters anime and distrust and chaos is bad for us. I think America could do a lot better. I think we could be even happier than we are if we could fix some of our social problems. Um, but I do think that despite all of our problems, uh, Americans seem to be doing pretty well on a happiness scale.

Speaker 2:          05:55          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Myth of pure evil is a term

Speaker 2:          05:58          coined by the psychologist Roy Baumeister. Um, which talks about a kind of a narrative that we all have in our minds. Um, it's parodied most perfectly in the Austin Powers movies in which there is a Dr Evil who does evil because he loves to do evil. There's no other motive. He just likes to do evil. Um, uh, we on the other hand are perfectly good. We fight evil. So it takes extent that you have bumper stickers on your car. Things like, if you don't like abortion, don't have one. Um, um, you think that you are on the good side and those ignorant fools and the other side are evil, uh, driven by ignorance or greed. Um, we liberals tend to think about racism in this way, especially. We think that racism is pure evil and racism happens for no reason. It just falls out of the sky.

Speaker 2:          06:42          Um, and it's a disease and a virus. We must all unite to fight this pure evil. This is what I mean when I say morality is a team sport and Airside is united by fighting the pure evil of racism. Um, the reality is always more complicated as baumeister shows, even in domestic violence, one of the most obvious cases of apparent case of pure evil, whether you're looking at domestic violence, racial assaults, whatever it is, murder especially, there's usually, uh, uh, an escalation. There's usually some fault on both sides. It hurts me to say that I know that people watching this are going to be offended because I've just said something sack religious for our, our social justice side. Um, but the reality is always more complicated. Um, you cannot understand the atrocities in the world by thinking they are caused by evil. In fact, almost all the trustees are caused by people pursuing the good, who believe at the ends. Justify the means. There is no pure evil. It's actually moral motives, a cloaked in a cloak of self righteousness.
