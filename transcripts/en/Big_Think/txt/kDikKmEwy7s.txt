Speaker 1:          00:00          I can't think of a single issue that, uh, democrats should draw. W, W, which American be I usually Democrats portray America, the beautiful a should we say, listen, we don't care about American beautiful anymore. We're going to get in bed with the oil spills and the clear cutters and the mountain top removal and the people who want to destroy America's beauty for profit don't want to portray that value. I taught my kids to sing the song. I should probably stick up for it. Which, which American badge, which we, we, we, we try. Uh, you've got, uh, the Statue of Liberty. May we just knocked that over a little, a little mall there, a little strip mall with Sasha. Used to be so we can join the anti immigrant crowd. No, the statue says, give me your tired. Give me your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

Speaker 1:          00:47          If that sentiment was good enough for our grandparents, it should be good enough for our grandchildren. The color of the immigrants might change. Our national values should not change that we are a nation of immigrants. We should be respectful of the contribution of immigrants. And you cannot be an anti immigrant, bigot and a Patriot at the same time. Those are things that don't go together. We're supposed to give that up. We're supposed to give up the idea of liberty and justice for all. Okay? We, we believe in liberty and justice for all. Just not for the gay people. You know, just leave them out or you're not for the poor urban black kids. Leave them out. We'll, we'll give them a justice based on their hoodies are wearing rather than based on what they're actually doing is. I mean, which American value are we supposed to betray?

Speaker 1:          01:31          Um, I'm not going to betray any of them. I think we should have liberty and justice for all. I think we should honor honor the, not just a statue of liberty as a symbol, but as also the substance, uh, that, that statue stands for. I think we should believe in America, the beautiful end offend America. But I'm not willing to give up any American values to appease people who, if you gave up those values, they would move 10 feet 10 more feet to the right. Anyway. Anybody who is in public life needs to find out what they believe in and in public life will test you. You may think you know what you believe in until you get put over those hot coals, the public life. Some people believe that Americans just as this land of, of, of, of, of individuals who have a lot of liberty and she'd be left alone because how we got so great, I can't find any evidence that that's a true story.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Best I can tell. The American Century, the last century when, when everybody looks at with such awe wasn't built by a bunch of random individuals who didn't care about each other and when do anything for each other and the government that was missing in action that was built by us pooling our resources, uh, mainly through government, massively investing in infrastructure, public schools and dams and roads and bridges and education. Educating a whole generation of young people at a level and scaled. Never been done before. Building a middle class. It had a labor rights and civil rights and women's rights to make sure that middleclass could include more and more people. Making sure that we were no longer poisoning the air and the water, taking care of our children, making sure that industry wasn't poisoned, killing our kids. That is what made this great American century that everybody's so off.

Speaker 1:          03:12          It wasn't just individual liberty or just a market economic performance. Lots of countries care about economic growth, but they have no environmental protections in the labor standards. That's not America. America is a great country because we perform well economically and meet those standards, but also we meet high environmental standards and high consumer protection standards and high civil rights, Labor inclusions. Here we are. We're a worldclass across the board. That's why people want to come here, not just because we got to hire a big GNP, you'd have great gmp and have people working as wet shops and have water and the air poison that's not America and so when you look at that as the kind of country that we are, then you say, I'm going to defend that. I'm going to defend my parents achievements. I'm going to defend my grandparents achievements. I'm not going to let people take a wrecking ball painted red, white, and blue, and smashed down every American achievement for the last century and call that patriotism.

Speaker 1:          04:11          In my view, it's not patriotism in my view. Patriotism and frankly being a conservative would mean you would conserve the achievements of our parents and our grandparents. They achieved the American Century, the American middle class, the American way of life. It includes a, an appropriately active government. It also includes a dynamic private sector. It also includes community responsibility and individual responsibility, but all of those together, not just free markets and and, and, and, and starved this America's government so they can't do its job. And so we have a responsibility, I think, to go forward and stand up for what we believe in. Whether we're running for office like some are or whether we're not like myself. We have a responsibility to defend the America that we inherited and to make sure that, that people calling themselves patriots don't smash them.
