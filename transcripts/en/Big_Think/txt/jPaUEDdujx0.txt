Speaker 1:          00:04          The short answer I would say is anyone. But the real answer I think is almost anyone. Um, I am very comfortable with the system that for a very acute period of time protects people from their own worst instincts. But I do mean a very acute period of time. I think the power dogmatic and Campbell, if someone you might want to prevent from committing suicide is the teenager who breaks up with a boyfriend or girlfriend and tries to overdose on tylenol and to tell them for a few days we're going to hospitalize you against your will. Listen, see men unreasonable to me. In contrast, someone who has suffered from chronic depression throughout their life with multiple suicide attempts. Clearly modern medicine, modern psychiatry has been unable to help this person. Um, while I wouldn't necessarily choose to end my life under those circumstances, I be respect someone else's right to do so. So the real standard I would use is does this person on the one hand have capacity to make this decision? Are they thinking clearly? Are they thinking rationally? And secondly, can they demonstrate this capacity over a prolonged period of several days rather than being in an instant? And I think the vast majority of people who wish to commit suicide wouldn't eat most of the both of those criteria.
