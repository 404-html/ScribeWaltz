So that is encouraging. But I look at the enormity of what's a hedge. And that's discouraging, but it doesn't really matter, does it? Because you'd never know. You can't get to that crystal ball. You'll never know whether you're going to succeed or a meteor writer's going to hit the earth and it won't matter anyway.
