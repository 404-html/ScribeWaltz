Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08          I have teenage boys and I started investing with them when they were 12 years old. So ideally the best time is when they're teenagers. I'm a big believer that those people who have been exposed to investing at an early age are going to be much more comfortable with the whole process as adults. So ideally parents starch start teaching their kids when they're teenagers, you know, open up a custodial brokerage account, help them choose stocks and mutual funds and let them be a part of the process. But that's not always the case because what we found from our studies is that so many adults are not equipped to make sound financial decisions. Their parents didn't talk about it there. Um, schools didn't teach them and so they're not in a position to teach their own kids. So the second best place to start investing is when you become in the workforce when you're 20, you know, 22 years old and he worked for a corporation that offers a 401k. In fact, our studies show that that's really when people begin to learn to invest, but then it's up to the corporation to provide financial education and literacy and encourage their employees to take advantage of this retirement vehicle

Speaker 2:          01:26          because young people have more time to weather the ups and downs of the stock market. They're in a much better position to take on more risk and you know with what little more risk you get a little more reward and that would be a reason to take on more risk. But again, it really depends on your, you know, how much you can stomach it, you know, can you sleep at night when there are bigger dips in the market? Because if you do have a bigger percentage of stocks in your portfolio and we have a big downmarket that your portfolio is going to react more so than say if you had less stock and more bonds. But again, over the long term history shows that if you take on a little more risk, you're going to get more return. But keep in mind, there is a sweet spot where there, if you take on a little bit too much risk, you're not going to get that much more return. So consider, you know, at the very least I'm saying, I'm going to say for a young person in their twenties, I would say, and again, it's very personal, um, at least 80% in a diversified stock portfolio for their retirement account or for those accounts that they know they're not going to touch and they're going to build upon over the year, save for the next 40 years.

Speaker 3:          02:44          Yeah.
