Speaker 1:          00:08          So consumer electronics has been an amazing cross industry for the last few years, right? We've seen this tremendous explosion in terms of digital TV's in people's homes and mobile devices. Now people with two, three cell phones are the types of mobile devices we're seeing net books and so on. So there's been this big growth of devices out there and that's obviously been a big part of Samsung. It's rise, but now what we see is more of a transformation to consumer experience. So it's less and less about the hardware itself. It's more about the emotional connection with it. It's about the experience of using the product. So your user experience, you Ui, Ux, that's becoming more important. Uh, the interface is much more significant than in the past. Design is a more important element to doc can feel. Touch of products. I mean, my favorite example is the TV used to be a big box.

Speaker 1:          01:06          You had hideaway in the corner of the room. Now it's something sleek, almost like a picture you want to hang up on the wall. So we're seeing that we're seeing more applications coming, content and services delivered through devices. So a cell phone started off being about just talking to people. Now it's much more about the content and services that you can get through that device. So that's really where we're going to see in 2010 I think a big evolution, which is now that now that all these devices are out there, we're going to see much more about the service and the experience that's delivered design or be more important user interface will be more important and all the kind of content that you can get through these various devices.

Speaker 1:          01:57          Yeah, it's right that the emotional feedback is becoming much more important than it used to be about a device for a devices sake. Now it's much more about what you can do with that. So what, what does it do for me as a consumer? And we think about the, the experience of using that. And so that's why we do a lot of research now to really understand consumer needs and consumer tastes and unmet needs of consumers. You know, we've really evolved in the consumer electronic space from being very technology driven to being almost like a consumer product or package goods industry where it's really about how we manage our brand and how we gain insights about consumers. So we have a big effort in terms of market insights and consumer research, which I had up here in North America to get out there, understand what consumers are looking for, what the unmet needs or not.

Speaker 1:          02:52          I'll give you one example which is to move content between different devices. So you know, I was out recently taking photos, you know, family for those on vacation. We get back, I pull out the card, put it into my pc and we all stand around a 20 inch monitor looking at these photos in the room next door there's 55 inch tv. That's where I want to watch the photos. So we need to make it much easier to move content between different devices, big screens for certain content pieces for certain content, mobile phone for certain content. So those kinds of insights that we can get from the way in which consumers use product. A, and also the things they want to do with products. That's where we can really get benefit.
