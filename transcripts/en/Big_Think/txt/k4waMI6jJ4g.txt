Speaker 1:          00:08          Away from our, from Dan price in some cases, seasoning to believe that a founding as possible. Some people think that it's not possible to have permanent principles or semipermanent principles, but that everything changes with history. And so you have something called the living constitution or a kind of historicized constitution that the progressive's first thought of, uh, in, uh, in the early 19th century. Woodrow Wilson is a great example of that. And I, I think that's a very popular view today. And yet, uh, when it comes down to crises, I think people look at our three branches of government, the separation of powers, uh, the fact that we have representatives for limited terms, all these fundamental things in our constitution and hold on to them

Speaker 2:          01:05          lamb. And still, I'm still believe that.
