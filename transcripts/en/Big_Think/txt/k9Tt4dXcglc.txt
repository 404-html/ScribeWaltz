Speaker 1:          00:05          Other people can learn from writer's life many things because La la writers' lives are so different. Some are processed. It's something that comes from outside. Some our process with their visions likes of me are different. I work like a cloak and then also my books are more like frescoes and epic, so I start from a corner and continue and continue without even knowing what the final picture will be in the end. 40 years of devotion to the art of the novel taught me one thing that is to pay attention to people's lives, to pay attention. What you wrote here about people's lives this now as strange as in my mind is based on interviews that I did with lots of people that that also taught me to be modest about people's life and play around with the details of their lives til it really sounds more real than reality.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Most of my life, I did not have a proper editor since I was writing in Istanbul. I am my own editor, but the secret of writing is the right thing. Self editing, editing, leading to your beloved ones, to your wife, to your daughter. To Your partner and hearing the story from other people's point of view. Never giving up your high standard of criteria of good writing, but continuing on and on and on and on, and editing and editing and care taking out, no matter how much time you gave to that beautiful page, perhaps that can also be cut out.
