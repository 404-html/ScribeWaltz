Speaker 1:          00:04          I was, uh, and I, I am, I'm a, I'll just say a positional player, but active positional player. Uh, so, uh, they had, uh, a purely positional player who was a world champion, um, for six years. But, uh, I had a active positional style and uh, I played, I played quite strongly a endings, so this was my, my advantage also, and then a different difficult positions which is quite seldom in more than chess. Uh, so, and I could resist in a, in a position for other place, probably will resign. And I, I was, I was, uh, uh, finding, uh, interesting, uh, interesting ideas, how to, how to defend difficult positions and uh, I could save money games so I never gave up. I was a stubborn as a chess player and uh, so I, I tried to defend even very bad positions and uh, in many cases succeeded as a, as a personality and fighter, you know, and, uh, I don't give up if I believe, uh, uh, I'm a, I'm correct. I'm right. Then I've broken a. okay. This could be overtures boards, it could be in life. And a saw. I defend my principles and in just in just, okay, this is a special, uh, special, uh, uh, how to say a characteristic when you, when you try to find the best for whatever position is because many people, they say, okay, this is bad. And then they, they lose the will to fight. I never lost will to fight.

Speaker 1:          02:16          This is a very important, and this is good question because many people would, would, uh, the situation, okay, they miss chances and then of course it, it will spoil the rest of the game. Um, but, um, it is concerning concerning not only special situation during the game, but also the results of previous game for the next, for the next game you play. So now in my life I, I tried and uh, I succeeded in many cases to forget every single was in the past. So of course you need to make some analysis and not to repeat mistakes, but it's extremely important, uh, to accept situation. Like it is the real situation, not with the salts and the regrets of what, what you missed. And uh, okay, to mostly goal, you'll have a winning position now you'll have to defend difficult position and probably, you know, you might lose the game.

Speaker 1:          03:18          So this shouldn't, shouldn't be venue play when you play chess game. So later on might be you and a license, then you know, you have to see then you make some conclusions by is a game. And this is also really important part for a, for just education because a chess, uh, chess is getting ideas how to accept a, how to accept a real situation and to be, uh, to be objective, to be objective and uh, to, to meet, uh, unexpected situations. And uh, to adapt this immediately and to start to sink and to solve the problems, you'll have to develop this. So I don't think it comes from, from your childhood, obviously your bus.
