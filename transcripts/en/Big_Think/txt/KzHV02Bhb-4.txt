Speaker 1:          00:13          I think Americans obsessed a lot over celebrity. But I think the thing that I've written that you have to remember is a small country. It, you know, there's an expression that they use saying that you punch above your weight, which means you kind of play with the big boys when you're not such a big boy. So Britain, you know, tries to be more of a kind of world figure than it may be is. And so it kind of wants to do an America does, but it doesn't have as many celebrities. It doesn't have, um, as many serious things to fill. It's paper with papers with as America does. So it, um, it has this weird celebrity culture filled with not that important celebrities actually a lot of newspapers that it has to sell and a lot of tablets that are completely, um, hollywoodized. I mean they're all about kind of crap really. And um, and so, so you do, it's, it's in the culture much more. I mean, there is a kind of lack of seriousness and discourse there because of all that. I think it's really brought down the tone of a lot of the papers, all this celebrity stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:19          I interviewed him, um, right before the dark knight was rapping. I think he was in his last couple of months of filming. And um, he, um, was, you know, he, first of all, he's really good looking. A lot of movie actors aren't good looking at all when you meet them, you know, they're much smaller than you would hope they were, which is fine. I've nothing against short people but, but you know, but you're disappointed because they don't look the same as you want them to look. And he was like a big strapping, you know, Australian guy. Um, he clearly was really bright, really creative, very restless. Um, and you know, but charming and charming and intelligent and clearly having a tough time with the filming. And one of the things we talked about was insomnia because I suffer from insomnia as well. So we were sort of trading tips, so you know, what kind of drugs to take and what kind of, you know, techniques we used.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And He, it kind of hauntingly said, you know, I've been taking ambien and I took one last night and it didn't work. So I took another one and then I only slept for an hour. And he said, you know, my mind is fizzing with this role. I cannot get my mind to shut up. And he didn't seem like he was, you know, on anything. He just seemed like he was clearly somebody who was one of those people who, who get so into his work that he couldn't comment down those voices that were all excited and fizzy. And so I felt just so sad at the way he died because clearly he was talking about that. And it was clearly was a mistake, I think because he just couldn't get any sleep. And I know what that feels like. Awful. And so it was just shocking because he seemed, he was so full of life and so lovely.

Speaker 1:          03:05          And we talked about his daughter. He was, you know, a little baby daughter. He just loved her and it was just such a waste. It was so sad. And again, you know, I just had, would have had no idea. And he certainly wasn't suicidal. He was really full of life, but it was so poignant. He was living in a beautiful rented house in London, and it had, I think three or four bedrooms. They took me on a tour, beautiful place, and he showed me every single bed had been, it was all messy, you know, all the sheets were everywhere. And he said, cause last night I just couldn't sleep. So I went from bed to bed hoping I could fall asleep somewhere. It's just so sad. I'm just so sad. And you know, you wonder if someone had really kind of taken him in hand and said, you know, let's, this movie's hurting your health. Let's try to work on this. If he could have been helped, who knows? You know, creative people are, you can't really, you don't really have answers, do you? Um, you can't really know what makes them tick. Um, but it was, it was just, it was a tragedy really.
