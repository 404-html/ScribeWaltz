Speaker 1:          00:07          Now remember, Central Asia was under Soviet rule for many decades, and before that it was part of the czarist empire. This is an area of many different ethnic groups. The Uzbeks, the Tajiks, the Kazaks, the Kyrgies, and to some degree, the territory is that these groups inhabited would never really clearly demarcated there. They're nomadic people, so they have traditional lands. But the Zaras came in and said, okay, this is where we're going to draw the lines. And then the Soviets came in and drew the lines and they don't really bear close approximation to where the particular people lived. So there are a lot of competing claims to wear. Their territory should be, and in these areas lie uranium, lie natural gas and coal and oil. So there are some struggles underway as to who should control what of these valuable areas. So you could have fights in the future that a territorial over, you know, who should get these prized areas.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Now on top of that, you have a situation where most of the governments in these areas are controlled by people who were once part of the Soviet bureaucratic machine. You know, they, they, they look and smell like old sue Soviet bureaucrats. Right. And they're, they're not, you know, they claim to be Democrats, but they're really not. They're, they're really very authoritarian. And with the new wealth coming from oil and natural gas, well most of that money winds up in the hands of their friends and relatives and cronies and a lot of of the wealth disappears into hidden bank account somewhere. Uh, you know, I'm thinking particularly of the family of Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan, which is the wealthiest of these countries. Meanwhile, most of the people in these countries are not getting any wealthier since the breakup of the Soviet Union. These are also predominantly Muslim countries.

Speaker 1:          02:30          They have been a target of the, of the Muslim Islamic fundamentalist movements of the past decade or so. I'm talking of groups associated with Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda and some of the other extremist movements that we've heard of. And these groups are finding some sympathy among the people of these areas who the governments to be corrupt, to be insensitive to their needs, to be pocketing all the money and giving it to their cronies. So in the future you could have uprisings, like the kind, we've had another countries that are fueled by Islamic propaganda, but really at heart are about the Maldistribution of resource wealth. You know, kind of like what I was talking about in the Niger Delta area where the elites claim all of the resource wealth conditions are deteriorating, the masses of the people are getting worse off, not better conditions, a deteriorating. And this is exactly the kind of fertile atmosphere in which extremist movements take off.

Speaker 1:          03:48          And, and this is what I worry about. This is an area of geopolitical competition between three great powers. This is the one part of the globe in which the United States, Russia and China are all competing for influence. At the same time, the United States, after the breakup of the Soviet Union saw this is an area to gain geopolitical advantage and new sources of energy. So first President Clinton and now President Bush have made an all out effort to gain influence in the stands is they're called Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan if I get them all right, but Russia which used to control this area under the Soviets and before that the tsars also wants to control this area. But now you have a third factor in here, China, which is very worried about instability and its back door. The Chinese region of Shen Jiang, which has a Muslim majority area and it's extreme west and it's the one part of China that's predominantly Muslim.

Speaker 1:          05:07          They are very worried about instability in this area. So it wants to have a say in what goes on in Central Asia and it has growing economic interests in this area. Also wants to tap into the, the resource riches of Central Asia has also become involved. So you have three great powers all seeking geopolitical influence it once the United States is providing military aid, Russia is providing military aid and now China has stepped in, collaborating often with Russia through a new organization known as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization or the SCO. And the Seo pr jointly with, you know, China and Russia together provide military aid to the stands. If this isn't enough, both United States and Russia have established military bases in the region, namely and Kyrgyzstan. You have about 50 miles apart, a US base on one side of Bishkek, the Capitol of Kyrgyzstan and a Russian base. On the other side. I mentioned all of this because you have to imagine a situation in the future where there's some kind of upheaval and Kyrgyzstan between, you know, one political faction against the other. The military breaks apart and somehow or another American soldiers and Russian soldiers get caught up in the conflict and overnight

Speaker 2:          06:42          have shooting.
