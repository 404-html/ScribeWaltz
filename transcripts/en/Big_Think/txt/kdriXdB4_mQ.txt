Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, I've been interested in writing online for some time. I was an early participant in salons table talk, which was their forum, the section in 96 97 um, because I just thought it was interesting that the readers could be published in the same space as the writers. That idea was intoxicating to me. And then I spent some time at Howard Rheingold site mindstorms cause I wanted to check out a different environment for writing online. But I didn't know anything about blogging because both those sites were produced by people who kind of new code. I didn't really know about blogging until a student in one of my classes in 2002 told me about it and he said, professor rose and this is really up your alley. And he described his blog, which wasn't opinion block. He was a conservative undergraduate at Nyu, obviously I minority, but he found in his opinion blog away to make connections and the and have a voice.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Right. And he started telling me sort of how the blogging system worked. And I remember he said, if you get a link from a big blog, you can get lots of readers. So I said, well, how many? You said five 10,000 and I found this staggering because the leading quarterly journals in my scholarly field, if that wasn't the kind of writer I was, wanted to be our like three thousand four thousand readers. Right? And He's already telling me that his opinion blog can get five or 10 overnight. So I didn't really understand what a blog was, but it's very interesting what he was telling me. So he told me to go check out his blog and insta pundit.com so I was very intrigued by what he had told me. And I started walking back to my office. By the time I got close to my office, that was closer to a running because I just had this sense that I wanted to know what it was.

Speaker 1:          02:11          And I remember logging in and looking at instant money and I didn't understand what it was because I was looking at the surface of the blog without understanding the blog is fear behind it. But once I did everything that I had been kind of wrestling with since table talk and mindstorms, I realized it's here. This is the thing, self publishing is here. That's a long revolution. Self publishing, that's a 300 year event, right? It's to the point where the capital required to be a publisher has gone down almost to zero. That's a 300 year event, you know, like a 500 year flood, so media time, that's like a thousand year flood. So I took a year to study blogging from 2002 to 2003 and the reasons I wanted to do it, we're about five. The main one was I wanted to have my own magazine with no editor to tell me what a valid idea about the press and media was.

Speaker 1:          03:24          I wanted to completely evade the existing editorial system because frankly it had kept me in a very limited state of expression for a long time. There's only so much that I could say if I wanted to publish a Columbia journalism review article, if I wanted to write in a hot bed for the Los Angeles Times, which I did. And it was just the frustration with the limited range of, of terms and the, the very stunted imaginary of the press about itself was the main reason I wanted to have a blog, which I conceived of as my own one person magazine, which is still my description of what press thing is. So I wanted to go around the gatekeepers and I wanted to know what was happening in this field because I was pretty sure as soon as I understood the self publishing is here, that it was going to have major consequences for professional journalism.

Speaker 1:          04:14          So I wanted to know it. I also wanted to catch up to, as it were, where my students were, right. And this student was a little bit ahead of, of the crowd, but he was definitely pointing me towards something that would connect me to my students. And um, and I wanted a platform to address both professional journalist. So I've been talking to for a while and my earlier work and this new class of potential journalist that I saw a rising up also, um, I have a phd. I did my dissertation on the whole idea of the public as this thing on the receiving and of the press. That was what my research was about. So when I say this is a 300 year of men, it comes out of that because what blogging means is that the self publishing public is real. You know, a lead and said, freedom of the press belongs to those who own one. Well, what I said was blogging means anyone can own one. That was exciting. That was something I had to be in on. And I knew by the end of that afternoon, I would have to have a blog.
