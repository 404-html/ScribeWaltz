Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:06          Rita dove title, professor of English, I guess you know, when I read this sounds really weird, but when I was about 10 or 11, I stumbled across the Elliot at home. My father had bought the great books of the Western world and one of the first books there was the elliot. I had no idea what it was, but it was a very long thing and I thought this is the beginning of literature, so I'm going to read this and I understood probably about half of it, but it was fascinating. It was an incredibly tense and interesting story and once I got into the whole way that the poems worked, it were like a, like a swash buckling mystery in a way. So that made me feel like, gosh, this is exciting. I'd like to do that too.

Speaker 2:          01:11          The one that I remember, I wrote posts before this, but the one that I consider first real poem was about that time too, but it was an easter poem. Um, in school we were supposed to write, write, or paint or do something artistic for Easter. So I wrote this poem called the rabbit with the droopy ear and I remember it because when I began writing the poem I had no idea how it was going to end. I just had this idea of a rabbit, the Easter bunny who had one ear that you know, droop down and he was distressed. So I kept writing and it rhymed and all that, and it was actually the rhyme itself that helped me solve the problem of a rabbit with the droopy year. So the end of the poem that goes hip, hip, hooray, let's toast the cup for now. Both ears were hanging up, he hanged himself from a tree and his ears hang straight and everybody's cheering. And I was just, I don't know, it was very exciting to find that. Indeed. I actually had to read it aloud in class, you know, that was another thing. Those were the days when you did these things in class, but now people showed their paintings if they had something from eastern. I had to read my poem aloud and, and people liked it, the kids liked it, my friends. So that was an instant success story.

Speaker 2:          02:31          It hasn't totally changed. Um, it, it's changed in the sense that, that, uh, to some extent I know let's say that the goal is not to come to some kind of neat solution as that did, but, um, but it hasn't changed in the sense that at some level I'm never quite sure how the poem is going to resolve itself and that I'm always in some way surprise. I make a discovery in a poem once I write it a buy now that means more accessing the subconscious and the fact that if I begin writing a poem on that means I'm intrigued in some way by whatever it's about and that if I'm not trying to find something new and pushing that envelope in the poem, I can't expect my reader to be particularly excited about it either.

Speaker 2:          03:31          Um, it's different every time. And in fact, years ago there was an, I did do something like that, uh, for a magazine. Uh, we're a, we're a journalist actually followed me around and we tried to. But, but I'm frightened different every time. My inspiration comes from everywhere. Uh, just walking down the street just and I never know where it's going to come from, so I keep a notebook with me at all times. Um, and the only criteria for anything making it into that notebook is if it stops me in my tracks for even an instant, if it catches my eye or my ear, you know. And, and I just write it down. That means that there are recipes in there, you know, there are words and sometimes there's a character description or sometimes it's aligned. And after that point though, what happens is kind of odd.

Speaker 2:          04:28          Um, I tend to, I work in fragments in the sense that I'm not going to sit down and say, first line is this, and now I'm going to just write my way through it. I let the poem, it's like piecing it together like a pot. So I might have a line that I might write down on the middle of a page and I still write things down with a pen on paper. I go to the computer when it gets too messy and use it like an elaborate typewriter because I've printed out. And then I mess it up again, but when I do get down, sit down to write in my room with my study and I try to write it a certain time every night. I'm a night person at best times or midnight to six, actually I'll leave you my notebooks and if something catches my eye and I feel like I want to transfer it from the notebook to the page I do.

Speaker 2:          05:21          And then comes this very strange process, which is difficult to describe and that, uh, right until I get stuck or I can't go any further, I'm boring myself or whatever. And then I might go to another poem. Uh, I might go to another folder where there are other drafts of poems and various stages of completion. And the only way I have for keeping track of all this fragment tarry stuff is by color. And I have different colored folders, red folders, blue, yellow. So I might go into my study, let's say one evening and say I feel like the blue folder today and I'll pick up the blue folder and see what's in there. So it's something that I've kind of worked out over the years, but the colors are only because I didn't want to put anything. I didn't want to file anything in a, in a straight.

Speaker 2:          06:18          Um, I think if you put something in a file that says war poems or love pumps, but you already restrict the way in which the pole might move. If I put it in blue, it could be sad blue, it could be happy blue, it can be peaceful blue. But my mood at the moment when I'm about to work on that poem wants, will, will tell me where I want to go. So it's an odd process, but I do do lots of revisions and I love to revise. So 30, 40 revisions is not unusual at this stage. I do most of my revisions by myself until I reach a point where I either need to give it lots of time because time is a great reviser to, you know, just months of, of uh, putting it aside or I will show it. A lot of times I'll show it to my husband who is a novelist and as a prose writer, he has a totally different take on things.

Speaker 2:          07:21          So he comes at it a different way. Um, I yearned for those old days, you know, from graduate school and you go into a workshop and people would give you all these ideas and you take it away from him. But at this point, um, that just doesn't, it's not in the current. So I think it's both. I think that, that you certainly don't have to be aged and you know, and, and travel the world to write a poem, in fact sometimes traveling the world is, is, is a way of not writing a poem, but it's the quality of experiences being able to, to experience something. And when you begin to write about it, be able to apply the tools that you need for writing, you know, a mastery of the language in a way of, of, of, of piecing together the language. I guess that those two factors have to come together.

Speaker 2:          08:24          So you do need to be to work at it, but you also have to be able to know when to, when to take the experience as it happened, when to tweak it a little bit, what part of the experience is going to move somebody else or what part is really your own private moment? So I've, I've seen poems written by very young people which are absolutely stunning and of course we have examples of bod layer and wrote. He was in his teens. These were amazing poem. So he obviously didn't have a wealth of experience or age or anything like that. And I've seen pumps which of course could only have been written by someone who was older and had lived a certain stages of life, have gone through certain stages of life. But it's a combination of the two really is, you know, I, I've always felt that the, the poems I've written, which have historical contexts are hopefully not just simply plucking something out of history and saying, oh great, let's write about that.

Speaker 2:          09:37          In every case, what has happened is that I've become fascinated or haunted by something and couldn't shake it as an African American, as a woman, I think that I've been sensitized to the way of which history of privileges of white male and the way in which certain aspects of history, the things that we are taught in school, the things that are handed down, never, never entered the picture, but they might've been very important. Anyone can tell you that, uh, at the risk of over simplification, let me say that anyone can tell you that, that, that, how you're raised as a child has a great deal to do with how you behave as an adult and, uh, whether you have complexes or whether you need to prove yourself or all that kind of stuff. And yet the mother in a traditional family who has raised chuck never makes it in the history books.

Speaker 2:          10:38          I mean, and so, so those kinds of things have always irritated me. Let's put it that way. And I'm, and I'm always reminded when I, when I see someone, Napoleon's stocks through the battlefields. And I think, yeah, but how do you get that way? How this guy become who he was. So that's, that's the predisposition I have. I think us as a writer, as a person who wanted to create poetry, that's one of the things that has always been one of my things I carry along with me each time is different. For instance, in this new book, which is a tells the story of a, of a black mixed race violin is George Bridgetown who grew up in 18th and 19th century Europe. I came upon him because I was watching a movie immortal beloved, and there was a scene in which Beethoven walks by a group of musicians and there's this black violence on my, what I've heard of color of my casting because it's a bit strange. And so I looked him up and the, I didn't intend to write poems. I above it. Um, I just wanted to know more about it and I kept reading and the more I read, the more I realized the only way I was going to get him out of my head was to get into his start writing down. So in each case it's, it's been something like that.

Speaker 2:          12:17          I think it's going to be a mix of things. What I find very interesting, well first of all, poetry of all the forms of literature I think is the most suited for the digital age and for the shorter attention spans and all of that. It, it, twitter's very easily some lyric pumps and um, it's very easy to zip up home to someone. So that's, that's one of the things I think wonderful about poetry in the digital age. I think that is going to be a mix between people who will really only need to see a book on a page and those who will only want to hear on the stage. I want to hear the hear the oral word. What's interesting about the digital age is because of all of the ways in which we have of transporting moving images now and making it very portable.

Speaker 2:          13:18          The oral aspect of portraits coming back in the portrait began as an oral discipline and we had the printing press and then it became gradually something which, uh, began to lose a little bit of its musicality because now we could read it. So all of the rhymed pumps, which, you know, all the formal homes, which certainly began as a way of, of, um, helping us remember a poem as an aid to memory it, that wasn't necessary anymore. We moved away from that. Now we have spoken word, right. It's coming back in. So it's, it's absolutely fascinating to me. I think it's going to change a little bit more, become a little bit more musical and we'll have a whole range of things. But it's an exciting time. My first advice would be to read, read, read it, which sounds interesting coming in a digital age, but it's so much easier to listen to upon it is to sit down and actually read it and to hear it in your head. And that's something that, that every poet or aspiring poet needs to be able to do anything to hear it in their head. What I wish someone had told me,

Speaker 3:          14:34          hmm,

Speaker 2:          14:39          I wish someone had told me that

Speaker 2:          14:45          my stories are really mine to tell another with anything that um, I think is important or that that has moved me, has the ability to move somebody else. It was a long process too for me. And I think for many young poets to be able to realize that even the smallest, the most domestic, uh, experience can move someone else. It doesn't have to be about, um, the Trojan war, you know, doesn't have to be the Elliot. It doesn't, uh, it doesn't have to be something that, again, here, we'll get to history that, that makes it to the front page of the news. But we live our lives in detail. All of us, we walked down the street, we breathe, we hear things, we try to transcribe it in generalities and the details are what make us come alive. And I wish someone had said that just at the beginning. So I wouldn't have felt so discouraged when I began writing and thinking who would want to hear the stories of a young black girl? You know, growing up in the Midwest, you know, that's not interesting. I have to live in Paris. No, you don't.

Speaker 2:          16:07          I'm not thinking of my audience, which does not mean that I'm doing it for myself. Uh, I'm thinking at the very beginning when I begin writing a poem, I try not to think of the audience or anyone at all except for trying to get at the very center of what's driving that poem. Why, why? In a way it's like analyzing myself. Why did I even sit down to write this? Why is it even interesting? What is it that drives this thing that means excess assets in the that means going down into the very deepest psychological moments. Things that can frightened and scare you and I think that to think of an audience at that point would actually drive those thoughts away. But during the process of revision and what happens is that I'm thinking about the language and how I can use the language, which is my tool to convey whatever this experience slash emotion is so that if anyone else sits down to read it, they can also feel it.

Speaker 2:          17:23          So it's beyond just saying, talking about describing something is also using words would help to shape the emotion so that if it's supposed to be something very hectic or a frantic moment, then the words probably would be shorter and clipped and things like that. During that revision process it becomes less and less a private matter and Baltimore, something for an anonymous audience. I don't try to imagine a an audience in the sense of at that stage I don't try to imagine the audience in the sense of, well these are all educated people, you know, from the ages of 18 to 45. I just think of there is someone out there who might want to read this. If they read this little bit. I want to get them to feel the same thing that I'm feeling and that's my audience, but that in the end I'm thinking only of them and I'm not there.

Speaker 2:          18:31          It would be wonderful if we were striving for toward a post racial literature and certainly the election of Obama is a big step on the way. I think that we shouldn't get complacent and think, oh gosh, now we're post racial. We are not, we haven't had the conversations we need to have about race and privilege and all of that stuff up. We're starting, so we're on our way, but one of the things that I've always dreamed of is to have a post racial literature at you waste so much energy and good a talent. I'm either trying to insist upon your presence, which is certainly what happened in the black arts movement in the sixties for instance. Uh, and you also waste a lot of energy then. I'm sorry, I lost my thought.

Speaker 2:          19:37          Well, you wasted a lot of energy insisting upon your presence, but then you also can waste a lot of energy explaining things, explaining things which are specific to your, to a certain racial culture, which if you think about it in terms of the mainstream, we don't mind looking things up if we don't understand them, but we kind of expect to be clued in on various things that happened in, in the culture. One of the things that I've always found frustrating are the little reference points that I might have to explain it, a poem that I wouldn't have to explain if it were in it, if, if it were a mainstream detail. For instance, I know exactly how a white woman would do her hair every morning. I know the washing and the blow drying and all of that kinds of stuff. But so that if I see that in a poem, if it were to occur in a poem, um, then I would have problem with it.

Speaker 2:          20:48          Whereas for me to, to even to get up and explain getting up and rushing in and how to do my hair, it would require all sorts of glosses. You know, I'd have to say, well, yes, there's the, there's the hair pomade and there's the visit. And uh, and, and so my hope is that in a, in a post racial, cultural, all these kinds of details, we will just assume that we can figure them out. And we will assume that that is something as we read them, that will, we'll have to look up instead of demanding that our writers, um, give us a gloss right in the middle of the palm. I think we're on our way.

Speaker 2:          21:32          It's so funny, when I was poet laureate, when I be, when I was named poet laureate and went down to Washington a little bit beforehand to meet, um, the, uh, assistant and meet the Librarian of Congress and all that into, to kind of acclimate myself. And I did ask what my duties were, the only official duties are to a sponsor, a reading series at the library of Congress twice a month and make sure that. So that was fun too, to be able to invite poets from all over the world actually to come to read and to read for the archives. That was wonderful fish. Dory. The other duty was to advise the library of Congress, the Librarian of Congress, and also, and this was the funny one, to promote poetry in any way that I see fit. I said, what does that mean to promote poetry?

Speaker 2:          22:29          And I said, well, what's the budget because you're going to promote you, but, and I got to kind of a blank stare. So I thought, okay, this means that you make it up as you go along. What else? The, the, you know, I'm an artist I could create and I decided to just do things, um, and fear they would stop me if they didn't have enough money, which was probably a good way to go about it because they did find money for, for various things. But what was interesting, it's not a, it's sort of like being Miss America for poetry. And that as a, as the poet laureate, you have an immediate, um, cache and you have some, you have stairs, people see you have some kind of publicity, some kind of a public stage. And I thought of myself as being more like a lightning rod.

Speaker 2:          23:25          People would say, oh, there's a poet laureate, let's ask her or tell her what to do. And I got so many letters right from the beginning, from people all over this country. He's telling me what I should do. And some of them were really good ideas, so, and I couldn't implement all of them and the time I was there, the two years I was there, the one thing that I found very, very helpful was to remember that many people are very frightened of poetry. And as poet laureate, I had a chance to travel around to just inject poetry in to everyday life whenever I could. And so I visited grade school kids or the naval academy and with all sorts of places where, where you thought, you know, didn't know they liked poetry or poetry was absolutely necessary. So, um, each poet laureate decide kind of what, how they want to use that public arena.

Speaker 2:          24:27          And I decided to to try to just be there and people's faces whenever the they turned around to make poetry something that was all around us. I went on Sesame Street for instance. And, and, and, uh, yeah, it was really fun. The other thing that happens with poet, the poet Laureateship, is that when you are. When I was in Washington, there was an opportunity to inject poetry into the government. And the other lawyer does not have to write official poems or anything. There were many occasions when I would be asked to say a few words, which is of course a kind of a euphemism for, to, you have a poem was there's always a poem. You can always find a poem for almost any human situation. So I didn't write poems or for specific events, but, um, I could look and see if I had a poem which would fit in that because I think that it's always important.

Speaker 2:          25:30          It's important if, if there's a celebration for some bill being passed, it's nice to have a poem there to remind us all of the human element and the human effort that went behind it. So that was, that was important to, um, the, the Penguin Anthology of 20th century American poetry is a Gargantuan, Gargantuan project. And basically, uh, I'm trying to make sense poetically, of the 20th century in America. So it starts, I'm really right there with 'em at Arlington Robinson and it goes up until anything published in the year 2000. I'm trying. So what the difference in the center algae is instead of just a poem here upon their two pubs where this person trying to give a sense of of major poets who then influenced other poets as well, so that we may be quite a few poems by say let's choose someone William Carlos Williams and then show how he influenced all sorts of other poets who may have a few other, not as many poems in the oncology. What makes a classic poem. I think that when a poem can move

Speaker 2:          27:15          readers across generations and across its specific class or race, then it becomes truly classic. I mean, in other words, if the poem is so moving that even if you have no experience in that particular setting, be it 19 twenties, Harlem, let's say you still are so moved that, that, that you can put yourself in that position. That means that the writer has managed to go beyond the, the, the personal and, and touch the humanity in all of us. And it's been really a blast to read it because I realized how, um, that this does hold true for the truly great poems. Oh Gosh, no, there's not a specific poem. There they are, it changes, changes depending on the, on the, um, what I'm working with, where I'm at at the moment, but there are, I mean, they're just poems that are just so amazing to me. Um, and I, and if I named one that I course lose another, but, but it, it goes in and out, I think that.

Speaker 3:          28:39          Hmm, let me think.

Speaker 2:          28:45          I can't name a specific one lines flow through my head. There's a,

Speaker 2:          28:51          a very beautiful German poem by Gerta, which I often say to myself because it's like a little prayer and uh, but it's also totally untranslatable I've never been able to translate it. And um, it's humbling because you realize the, we need translators. Please, please, please, we need our translators. Otherwise we'll never have any of these posts, would never know who, how bottom layer moves us or anything like that. But you also realize how much gets lost, how, how necessarily poetry is so bonded to the, to the language in which it is composed that it's, you're, you're always going to lose. And I find that very humbling. Um, so yeah, but it's a wonderful woman that rhymes, but it rhymes in odd ways about other gifts and I live vip spirit. His Stu calm. I'd how Baltimore binder who was out. That's it. And you can hear the rhymes and basically transfer it. It says overall the mountains. Tranquility rests in all of the tips of the trees and that's VIP for which is a great little winter. All the tops of the trees you can. You can hardly feel a breath.

Speaker 2:          30:32          Wait. Just wait. Soon. Youtube will rest. And it's just, it's because of the minds that make this such a calm and it's just in certain words that totally untranslatable like vip, which does mean tips of the trees, but that doesn't sound very good in English, but it, it's, it's almost rocks you to sleep and I just find it incredibly amazing poem tightness. And yet tranquility could let me think. What could I do a longterm? I'll read one, I'll read a short one and a, but I have to give you a little gloss for it. I'm in. This poem is from my new Book Sonata Melodica, which tells the story of George Bridge Tower, a Mulatto violinist from the 18th and 19th centuries. In this poem, he was a prodigy. He's a little boy, 10 years old in England playing his violin in front of all of the music lovers of London, and his father is sent back, sent away from London.

Speaker 2:          32:04          The Prince of Wales says, I'll take care of the little boy, and so you have this little boy who is has the best job in the world for a musician, but at the same time he has no family, and in this poem the prince has ordered him to go into as women to change into British clothing. The undressing first, the sash peacock, blue silk unfurling round and round until I'm the India ink darting a called British. Now I can bend to peel off my shoes, try to hook the tasseled tips into the emerald sales of my set and pantaloons fair. Well sir, monkey jacket, monkey red, a do shirt, tart and bright as the lemons. The prince once. Let me touch goodbye. Lakeside metal, goodbye hummingbird throat. No more games. I am to become a proper British gentlemen cuffed and buckled with breaches and I find Krevak, but how my tossed bedclothes while I. I am a smudge acquainted wick. A twig shrouded in snow.
