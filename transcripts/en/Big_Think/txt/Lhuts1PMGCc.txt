Speaker 1:          00:08          If I gave one piece of advice

Speaker 1:          00:12          to the world about how to avoid diseases, I would say have clear lines of definition and demarcation and that makes it sound like I'm recommending exercise as number one because I want the absence of fat under the skin. I think that is the single most powerful generator of most diseases. It affects cholesterol, it affects triglycerides, that affects diabetes, therefore dialysis, therefore blindness, therefore amputation. It affects cancers and so on. So the best way to do that is of course to put diet and exercise together as far as, um, uh, immunizations. Frankly, that's a question, uh, in our culture that is mostly immunize those people who choose not to get immunized or sort of living off the benefits of those who did because the disease incidence is low, but there have been several studies to show that whooping cough epidemics have begun to occur in those populations who have not been immunized or adequately immunized or recently enough been immunized and whooping cough is nothing to fool around with.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Frankly, my children are grown and I don't know what I would do if the question were asked me now, uh, do you want your kids immunized for all of the things they're doing? I will say this, I would spread it out a little bit. I don't think you need to jump in and the first week or month and start the immunization process as for seat belts and, uh, you know, avoiding too much sun and hence melanoma. You shouldn't be in the sun. Vitamin D levels are very low in our culture. You should be in the sun before 11:00 or after 1:30. Uh, and you need a great deal. You need a high vitamin D low. You should not avoid the sun. You should be in the sun. What's happened? If you've already developed a skin cancer of some variety, then you really need to think about taking vitamin D as a supplementation in our western culture. I think virtually everybody should probably be on vitamin D. I've never seen one person who had a 25 hydroxy vitamin D, three level of 80, which is considered more or less the best level. Everybody in my practice of thousands of patients is below that number, so I think just across the board, people need vitamin D. I've seen a few people in the seventies, uh, but uh, not missing.

Speaker 1:          02:52          Everybody has a genetic predisposition to develop multiple disorders, but those disorders occur if only if the person does what's necessary to express that weakness. So those people who are exercising adequate, virtually everyone who follows an organic, unprocessed whole foods diet that the 87 point five percent level and who exercises a an hour a day is going to have the kind of physique that I've just recommended. And of course that's a lot of time and people say, who has the time, pay me now or pay me later, do what you're supposed to. And then you'll find out that you'll avoid diseases. Dr. Visit a high copays, high health insurance being rated by your insurance, having surgery and so on and so on. So if you put the time in, now it's sort of like an education. You put the time and now you get the benefit down the road,

Speaker 1:          03:51          you should get a rectal examination for cancer. Of the prostate, I think thermography is a better way for women to go than mammograms. It's a heat registering technique that gives no radiation. There is a time and a place for a mammogram. There's a time and a place for an MRI and of course now the big hot news about cat scans and so on is that they are cancer generating at about one in 500. So I'm a. people over the age of 50 should get a colonoscopy and people should be doing stool blood for a Globan Glo bin or what's called a cult blood, uh, to detect cancers of the bow. If you have stomach distress and intolerance, you might need to be checked for a bug in your stomach called h dot pylori or wheat allergy called CELIAC disease. So these are some of the kinds of things, but everybody should get their cholesterol checked.

Speaker 1:          04:48          Everybody should get their diabetes checked. There are 25 hydro a diabetes test called an a, one c, they should get cholesterol, which should be less than 1:50. Triglycerides, which should be less than 100. A one C, which should be less than five point five, 25 Hydroxy d three, which should be right around 80. And those are some of the biochemical tests that might be of interest for people. Um, but, uh, we've mentioned a colonoscopy, mammogram, rectal examination, pap and pelvic for women. Uh, I do think that as much as I have hesitancy about the injection of foreign proteins called immunizations, if I had a daughter, I probably would want her immunized for HPV. Uh, but again, I wouldn't rush into it, but once you became sexually active, I would certainly want to have a discussion until she made a final decision whether or not it should be my decision at this point. So she doesn't have a voice in, uh, that, uh, is a different discussion.

Speaker 1:          05:56          Disease reversal is not impossible. You can reduce the weight of diabetics and for all apparent reasons, uh, hi. Uh, their diabetes goes away. You can do the same for high blood pressure. You can, for lack of a better word, put it in quotes. Cure. There are doctors who argue against that saying that you cannot cure. I'm a hypertension. You cannot cure diabetes, you cannot cure high cholesterol. Well, it's very academic, whether you want to argue about can you cure it or not, I can make all the signs of it go away or reduce a person to Claude, clear lines of definition and demarcation. Most diabetes will go away. The vast majority of hypertension will go away. Then of course, you have to address salt. A salt intake has to be comparatively low. Um, and uh, um, you have to address exercise. So I believe that for the most part, diabetes can be reversed. Almost 90 percent of high cholesterol can be reversed. Virtually 95 percent of high triglycerides can be reversed. Um, cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes, cigarette smoking. Uh, it's been shown time and time again. If you stopped smoking, the cells in your lungs begin to change back to what they should have been and so on. Plus, you'll reduce, when you do all these things, you reduce back pain, you reduce depression, uh, you reduce a predisposition to accident. Overweight people have more accidents.
