Speaker 1:          00:00          I am very good at hiring because I've made a lot of mistakes. I learned to look at the specific individual and look for the most important traits in them and ignore everything else, especially the resume. Send you in the wrong direction. I learned through trial and error what makes a great manager, what makes a great salesperson, and that's who I always are. If you're going to hire a lot of salespeople for your organization, I found that I looked for the same three things in every single person I hired. I wanted someone who was insecure with something, approve. If somebody walks in, they're cocky. They never become. Your great salespeople. Might top 10 salespeople making millions of dollars a year. Every year came to my office in December, swearing. They would never have another good year. Why? It was ridiculous, but they were insecure enough to think it could never happen again.

Speaker 1:          00:56          You want an insecure person. If you're hiring a salesperson with something to prove. You also want someone who has a positive attitude in every way because you know what happens. A positive person when they get hit and sales is all about getting hit and knocked down, they spend very little time feeling sorry for themselves. They get right back up that backout you almost need a low Iq like hit me again, hit me again, hit me again. That's a great salesperson and then you need the work ethic to go with it. Nobody is great and sale unless they work like crazy. So those are the three traits I look for in every great salesperson. What I look for in a manager is someone who's going to be loyal. I mean heck, if I'm going to build a giant house, which is my business on a shaky foundation, how far am I going to get?

Speaker 1:          01:45          I need a structure with a footing is loyal as can be, is going to stand there through the thick and thin. I also need someone who believes that we're going to succeed. I need someone with a positive attitude, always a positive attitude because you know what I find, I find a manager with a positive attitude is always going to find a way to get to where you want them to go. A mark of a good manager is someone who's organized. I always ask everyone I'm interviewing in an interview. On a scale of one to 10, how would you rate yourself as an organized person? I never hire anyone who says nine or 10. I want the guy who says, oh, I'm bad at 12. A manager without follow through is useless. You gotta be able to give the command. They get it done and they don't forget about it when something distracts them. A manager always follows through.
