Speaker 1:          00:09          You know, history has tended to move people toward mutual acceptance. You might say, you know, in other words, the moral compass has expanded, uh, over time. If you compare us to the time back when people in one hunter gatherer village thought the people in the next village or subhuman, um, that doesn't mean that continued progress is, is guaranteed. Okay. What is, what is guaranteed? And this is what's interesting to me and this is, this is what leads me to think that it's, it's not crazy to say that, uh, there's some larger purpose with a moral dimension unfolding through human history. What, What's interesting to me is that the way history seems seems to kind of be set up, although I know set up is kind of a biased a term because I'm, I'm not sure that any anybody or things set it up. But, um, the, uh, the way the system works is that if people don't make the moral progress, they pay a price.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Okay. So right now in the history of the world, if people in the different abrahamic faiths, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, don't get better at accepting one another, don't get better at tolerance, it can be really bad for the world on an epic scale. You know, it could be, we can be talking about the collapse of the society and, uh, I think this is built into the system and we've seen it time and time and time again, that history forces people to either expand their moral compass or pay the price. And so all I can say for sure is that, uh, for pretty sure is that, that I think the salvation of the world in the sense of just holding the system together. You know, having some degree of peace and order, uh, depends on further moral progress. Uh, that doesn't mean that the outcome will be good.

Speaker 1:          02:07          But it's interesting to me that, that the system drives, drives us toward this point where we either make the moral progress or we pay the price. So, uh, and this is actually reminiscent of something that various biblical prophets were kind of saying in one sense or another. And not just biblical prophets. I mean, I would say, uh, Mohammed, I would say abrahamic prophets in general. A common message is to say that, uh, salvation is possible. So long as you align yourself more closely with the moral axis of the universe. Now usually these profits, they didn't use the term moral access to the universe. Of course they use the term God, but they did think of God as the moral axis of the universe. And I would say that even now, even if you're secular, uh, you, you, you can still that the salvation of the world and this concrete sense of holding it together, um, is going to depend on humanity, aligning it self more closely with the moral axis, uh, of the universe. If you agree with me that that access involves things like, uh, acceptance of people who are different from you and, and overcoming, you know, prejudices and biases. And so on.
