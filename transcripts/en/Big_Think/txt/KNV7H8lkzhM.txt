Speaker 1:          00:07          Uh, I think collectively we should be all together at the table much more often than we are because I think that the table is a such a magnet for interaction from the family onto world issues. Uh, it's Ford is a conduit to a venue that we can sort of permeate each other's thoughts and all that. So at the table, beginning with the family and the family, eating together to the leaders, eating each other's food at the table and maybe discussing, uh, the point, an issue over a nice bowl of pasta. I think individually we should have a consciousness of herself, of her body, of living well and using food to get them in a positive fashion. You know, using food to give us pleasure using food to lose those few pounds. Enjoyably not in a negative negotiation because I think today food is a negated a lot, you know? No, no, no. Instead, food is yes, yes, yes. It's the right food is the right amount at the right time.
