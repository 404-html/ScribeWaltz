Speaker 1:          00:05          I think a lot of people just assume that the way to make more intelligent just to make them more human, but I think that's a very dubious assumption. I think we're much better off with tools with colleagues. We can make tools that are smart as the Dickens and use them and understand what their limitations are without giving them ulterior motives, purposes, a drive to exist and to compete and to beat the others. Those are features that don't play any crucial role in the competences of artificial intelligence, so for Heaven Sakes, don't bother putting them in. Leave all that out and what we have is very smart things that we can treat like slaves and it's quite all right to treat them as less because they. They don't have feelings. They're not conscious. You can turn them off. You can tear them apart the same way you can with an automobile and that's the way we should keep it.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Now that we're in the age of intelligent design, lots of intelligent designers around. A lot of them are intelligent enough to realize that Oracle's second rule is true. Evolution is cleverer than you are. That's Francis Crick's, famous quip, and so what they're doing is harnessing evolutionary processes to do the heavy lifting without human help, so we have all these deep learning systems and they kind of in the varieties, there's basie and networks and and a reinforcement learning of various sorts of deep, deep learning neural networks and what these computer systems have in common is that they are competent without comprehension. Google translate doesn't know what he's talking about when it translates a bit of Turkish into a bit of English, doesn't have to. It's not as good as the translation that a bilingual can do, but it's good enough for most purposes. And what's happening in many fields in this new wave of ai is the creation of systems.

Speaker 1:          02:38          Black boxes where you know that the probability of getting the right answer is very high. They are extremely good. They're better than human beings at churning through the data and coming up with the right answer, but they don't understand how they do it. Nobody understands in detail how they do it. I know, but he has to. So we've created entities which are his inscrutable to us as a bird or a mammal considered as a collection of cells. This inscrutable is still a lot we don't understand about what makes them tick and we can use these products, these intellectual products without knowing quite how they're generated, but knowing having a good responsible reasons for believing that they will generate the truth. Most of the time, no existing computer system, no matter how good it is, that answering questions like Watson on jeopardy knows how the system is conscious today, not close. And although I think it's possible in principle to make a conscious android, the conscious robot, I don't think it's desirable. I don't think there would be great benefits to doing this and there'll be some significant harms and dangerous to you could at tremendous expense, but you'd have to have in fact that quite a quite a revolution in in computer design, which would take you right down, right down to the very base of the hardware.
