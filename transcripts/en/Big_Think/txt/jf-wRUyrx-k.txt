Speaker 1:          00:07          Sort of roundabout way I got into the story because my, my great grandmother, sister and my great grandmother immigrated to the United States from Slovenia in Nineteen Oh, five. And one weekend my great grandmother's sister went to Chicago and was never heard from again. Um, and I, you know, it was always intrigued about this and didn't really know much about the story. Nobody in my family had any, um, really, um, traceable information. But I thought it would be interesting just to explore the circumstances that could have led to her disappearance. And because I knew Chicago was a pretty dynamic and dangerous place at the time. So I just started going through microfilm, a Chicago Tribune Microfilm and 19 and five and came upon the marshal field junior shooting and was immediately intrigued by that because it was huge news. And um, soon after coming upon this shooting, I found the everlys sisters. And, and then of course, you know, forgot all about my missing relative because they were so much more interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:03          I,

Speaker 1:          01:08          I never cared to know. Once I, like I said, once I came upon the elderly sisters, I didn't care about finding anything about her, but I got an email a few months ago from somebody who said, you know, Dear Karen, I'm not a stalker, but I found your great grandmother and the Ellis Island records, um, and it seems, and I fell, so found another woman named Maria who came over with her non nine in 1905. But in 19. Oh four. Um, and they both settled in Pittsburgh, which is where my family had settled and the person said they tried to track to see if this woman went to Chicago, but there was no record of her in Chicago, which if, if it were her was, her, wouldn't have been surprising. Um, you know, being that she was a poor immigrant. Um, and if so she did disappear. It certainly would have been high on the police departments, um, priority list to sort of track down and see what happened to her. So that was the closest I got to, to um, any other clue. And I assumed that that was probably.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Well, the sister is a good question because they were very, um, part of their main facet of their personalities was their ability to sort of camouflage who they are and to keep changing who they were and to change their backstory so frequently that, that nobody really could pin them down and they told people they were from Kentucky, they told people they were from Virginia and they told people they were from Indiana and I was able to pin down that they were in fact from this wealthy family in Virginia. Um, but they had fallen on hard times and nobody knew the really sad part of their story, which was that their father is the one who forced them into prostitution at a very young age. Um, and they of course lead everybody to believe that they just decided to become mad. I'm just on a whim, um, after sort of coming into an inheritance enjoining a theatrical troupe and, and seeing that this might be a good business opportunity. Um, so, so there was a sort of sad undercurrent to their story that, that was really interest.

Speaker 2:          03:15          I think it was, it was terrible.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Things, I do think that they were colored by their experience, um, and, and being forced to be prostitutes themselves. Um, they, like many people who became magnums, they, they began in the business like that and I think that they were subjected to such degradation that they really would concern them, that they wanted girls that they had not to be. They wanted to spoil their girls, not exploit them. They wanted to treat them as they wish they had been treated. Um, I think that was a large part of it. I think the other thing was they saw, looked around and, and we're realists and saw that there was not much opportunity for women. This is 100 years ago, women couldn't vote. A women couldn't even enter saloons where politics were discussed. I mean, there was absolutely no way for women to enter political discourse or, or have a say in anything. Um, and all of these reformers who were trying to quote unquote help these women, um, these sisters were actually doing work concretely to help these women than they were, you know, providing them with food and clothes and, and meals.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Just from me of something funny Minnesota, she said it entertaining, most men in the parlors is more tiresome than with the girls lose their social standing over. Um, so, so yeah, girls were lose, lost our social standing by being promiscuous by being prostitutes. A lot of girls in fact were kicked out of their home for being promiscuous. I mean, it was such as considered such a egregious offense back then that you could actually be kicked out of your home and a lot of them enter prostitution. Figuring, well, if I'm going to be kicked out of my home, I might as well be paid for it. What? Of course, it was a huge stigma. Um, and I think the elderly sisters, part of their, part of their goal was to help girls to reform themselves in terms of returning them back to polite society if that's what their ultimate goal was. A lot of their girls ended up after leaving the club, marrying into wealthy families across the United States. I'm marrying senators and prominent businessmen and whatnot. Um, so, you know, men, of course there wasn't a stigma. In fact, that was a badge of honor to be admitted into the everly club. Of course, the usual double standard applied, but, but, you know, the everly clubbed seemed to be the one place where girls could sort of overcome that, that, that stigma,

Speaker 2:          05:38          I think part

Speaker 1:          05:40          of their power came from, from the fact that they were able to. So I'm so completely covered there pass. I'm in the book, I call them in 19th century amalgamation of Martha Stewart and Madonna. Um, because they just kept reinventing themselves and reinventing themselves. And I even think that minute in, by the time they were older, they believed every lie they ever told. Um, I think that they completely bought into the idea that they were aristocratic ladies who had these, you know, privileged, lovely upbringings and, and never had a hard day in her life. Um, I think that by that point that that's their story and they were sticking to it and no one really had any right or, or a reason

Speaker 2:          06:21          to know anything different.

Speaker 1:          06:29          The early sisters wielded tremendous power and part of the reason they went into this business, it was, if you think about it, it was the only viable, um, business where a woman could actually be the commander, not the commander in chief, the CEO, if you will. I mean, it was the only women did not run in the street. They weren't masters of their domain. This was the only industry where women could actually assume a position of power. And the everglades sisters were very powerful in that regard. They, they dictated who was allowed on their club and who wasn't. They had a very specific set of rules, um, you know, in the men paid dearly for that. And I think, uh, the sisters felt that if anyone was being exploited, it was the men in this equation, um, especially in light of the fact that the way they treated their women and made sure that the women were never abused by these men are mistreated by these men. Um, I can't say the same for other, for other brothels. Um, I think that, um, especially when the men were in charge, either there were there, um, the, the exchange of power,

Speaker 2:          07:32          much difference. This all was one of my favorites

Speaker 1:          07:40          characters. Um, she, she was the rival Matt, I'm the rival Madam to the everly sisters and, and sort of was the Queen Bee Madam until they came to town and, and um, you know, had, had worked her way up and spent quite a bit of time and effort really establishing herself in Chicago and she was this scrappy, relentless woman who was not uptown, you know, she didn't even know what I've tabbed looked like and she did not at all appreciate these two sort of aristocratic sister sauntering in with their, they're flying ehrs and, and sort of taking what she thought was rightfully hers. And um, the fact that you tried to frame them for murder twice as a, it was, I, I mean, I just couldn't have made her up. And I always say if there's ever a film adaptation, a bet midler has to play. Vic Shaw, I actually sent back with a copy of the book, but I'm, you know, I'm sure she's, she's going to call me any minute now and want to do that. But, but, uh, you know, I, I really don't enjoy

Speaker 2:          08:40          the.
