Speaker 1:          00:00:14       Is anyone here knows? She just generally by raise of hands, how many people were present before she tell the Chinese journalists in 2004, the Chinese government distributed document 11 to Chinese news agents around the country telling them to not cover the 15th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre was, had a meeting where a document level of disgust, he took those, type them up and then set them off to a New York based Pro Democracy Ngo. She acts with not just one of the expression, but it was also an effort to undermine the propaganda by a, uh, by an infested regime.

Speaker 1:          00:01:03       One of the things that she does cover is the degree to which the Chinese government thinks about censorship as engineers who are thinking about a day. I'm very politically contentious moments. They raised the dam to pay very close attention to what's going on. And during liberal periods they let it go. Um, obviously you're an anniversary of the canvas, but messenger is a pretty contentious pack and they're going to be paying very close attention. So for instance, if you send an email with the year 1989 as your username, if you're going to pay attention to that, if you're sending state secrets about a documentary revealing of propaganda, a strategy to have political opponent, United States of America, they're going to pay attention to that. They picked up a, she passed email and they asked Yahoo to reveal the user information for this email address from a very tiny second. We know she has ip address, we know she tells a email. This email was sent from a Chicago address because God gave it over to the state security apparatus and she had was condemned to 10 years in prison where he is right. And there's a real question about how should, as United States citizens as residents of the West, we react to the United States. Congress had one answer. They have a series of hearings and the inquiries into this during the Sciatica who was less than forthcoming. And those hearings culminated in a northerly anxious tongue lashing by a representative in the WHO's has particular experience with oppressive regimes. Representative Lantos, the only surviving member of the congress. Um, who, uh, the

Speaker 2:          00:03:23       conquer that game Herrmann I by the night jumping off the matter would not all what happened, but I really don't believe that way that would lead me to say that we haven't tightened up that whole lot better than me. You don't have a whole lot better. And like I understand that comment at the end of the day, I have the highlight in an environment that is very cool

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       said to the police, which pretty much everyone agreed with except the actual tickets. Anyway. We are currently facing a similarly complex situation, be enough as issued a circular which we don't have access to perhaps because of that have been translated in English perhaps because it hasn't made its way out of the country, but the circular. It's bloggers from creating posts which the government says incite violence or crime undermine national security, including inaccurate information or disclose eight secrets. And the real question, I mean there are really two questions. The first is, should we ask stakes, residence, attempt to change the situation or attempt to protect the privacy information of medicines who are based in are going to break it down to right now. That's something everyone is going to be able to answer on their own in their own teams and the second half of this presentation, the question I'm going to try to explain the answers to is what we can do.

Speaker 1:          00:06:12       If we say yes, we should change. Yes, we should go and attempt to use every power that we have, every course that we have to protect the privacy of political dissidents in China. So the funnel, our thoughts on this, I'm gonna have to defer to professor Lawrence Lessig who lays out for metaphors for regulating the content of flow of human behavior on the Internet because it's obviously a challenge as to whether these categories are distinct all the time. I mean, they're definitely learned often as we learned in law school, but these are the basic or factors that I want or that I suggest all of you think about in determining what your team's solution is going to lead to. This problem and what you think everyone's collective solution should be for the problem that we're going to introduce the second half of the class norms, mind, law and code.

Speaker 1:          00:07:08       Have you guys another 10 seconds just to look through it. If there's any questions on this, feel free to raise them right now. All right. I guess we're pretty familiar with this framework. So we'll move on to the global network initiative. Local network initiative as a sort of voluntary guidelines which the Internet companies a specific signatory, Jerry Yang will get harangued by representative who they sign onto a series of principles, guidelines and a framework for going forward, documenting and streamlining the process by which they interact with the pressing machines who request private information of otherwise anonymous for, uh, individuals with pseudonyms, a political dissidents in trunk while we're political dissidents and across the world.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       Uh, so we're gonna start with whatever condition and hopefully by discussing the details and getting into the language of this framework, we can massage out some of the benefits and tensions of this, uh, of this. Uh, so we started off with three basic elements of the global network initiative, sort of principles, which are general aspirations and goals, the ideals of the signatories, Google and Yahoo have signed onto this, a bending implementation guidelines which are the real meat and potatoes, the specifics which these companies have agreed to, and this framework by the way, it was set up as a negotiation between academics, these companies and human rights groups mentioned. And then finally the governance accountability and learning framework. A plan for putting this framework into motion over what is now the next four years. So we're going to just start off with a basic understanding of how these principles, the principles are founded upon, or at least with respect to privacy. Privacy principles are kind of two basic claims. A two basic assertions, one that privacy is a human right to privacy is a guarantor of human dignity. From here, the guys move on to a series of ships, some ideals about what, what, what these companies are aspiring to be. A part

Speaker 1:          00:09:27       starts off with. Everyone should be free from illegal arbitrary interference with the right to privacy and should have the right to the protection of the law. Again, such interference or a test, right? Privacy should not be restricted by governments excepted narrowly defined circumstances based on getting actually recognized laws and standards and these restrictions should be consistent with international human rights. Now he's principles are so wide, so broad in terms of what we can imagine their applicability to be that they are inevitably going to be somewhat watered down when we get to the real specifics. In fact, just by highlighting this principles, a g and I framers were telling us these are not specific to which we should hold these Internet companies accountable. Those specifics are going to come. Any implementation guidelines still there is something to point out in terms of watering down shaded in gray except the narrowly defined a circumstance.

Speaker 1:          00:10:24       The face, I'm internationally recognized standards, so on the one hand the principals generally close the door on privacy invasions, but they always open windows and whether or not you think this is a good tactic in terms of what kind of Lsd you all want to prep, what kind of approach you want to take to solve the problem, and it's up to you. This is one of the things that I thought was important to flag and the principal section will be on implementation guidelines. I think it's just important to take a look at the kind of language which the implementation guidelines to use.

Speaker 1:          00:11:00       This is just a section of implementation guidelines, just like I like the kind of language of uses a, so they're going to receive and evaluate regular reports for management. We're going to review and they're going to participate in training. All of these words are rather subjective. What does review mean? What does receive mean? What is participating in ultimately that is determined by WHO's interpreting it. These are voluntary guidelines. Have anything to just specific words might or might not have an effect. As we saw in Lauren's less extreme work, he's will certainly affect norms that a potentially will affect markets. Therefore in terms of what he see these Internet companies doing and me hold them up to certain norms either by shaming them or by using our power as consumers. That's going to determine how effective the wording is. Any implementation guidelines. So that said, I've given out a packet to everyone and I want you to take a look at the privacy section of the implementation guidelines now that you have a sense not only of the principals but also the general approaches the implementation guidelines take. I want you to read through those privacy guidelines and judge for yourself how effective they are and whether or not that would change the approach when you have a chance to do what they've done in about 40 minutes. We'll give you guys about a minute and a half to do that.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Alright, so moving on, we're going to move onto the global online freedom act, which is a legislative attempts to use law to create a different approach that solves the same problem. Uh, so the global online freedom act was introduced by representative Chris Smith and it uses a rather more objective approach to a certain degree. That might be because of the negative language that these groups cannot do that. On the other hand, it might be because a judge would be interpreting, locate elective or obtain personally identifiable information, the

Speaker 1:          00:13:16       global online freedom that does run through the State Department, which only recently has raised a Snafu, have a bit of an obstacle to the enforcement of the globe on my freedom back, which by the way, it's only been asked the past in the house was not passing the Senate. So there's not long and that's that the secretary of state has explicitly said that human rights are going to be secondary to economic survival during the recession. So that is one slight snafu with the, with gofundme as, as it's called, is that it only highlights certain countries. Others through Ethiopia I read and specifically Vietnam. And that's a problem in America, which I will go straight, but they help quite a bit in general what he does, and I know sometimes on this one. So what do you generally illustrates is that our own country has been responsible for major invasions of privacy. The NSA most recently has been sued by the Electronic Frontier Foundation for a series of more into wiretap and is it really, are we really being consistent, fair, or is it just something that we want to do to create a law that only applies to other countries when our country might be said to have binding at the very end. I'm just going to sum up by just saying these are the four general forces that you should think about. Attorneys not only analyzing these two solutions but also crafting your colon

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       and with that we're going to move onto the guest is managing director of the Burqa and sack the cofounder of the information technology group at Harvard Centers for International Development in teaching a course this semester on the technology and politics, Internet control, and he was very involved in the crafting of the global network initiative. Andrew Mclaughlin, which we are trying to prepare early connect with over skype for to Jack is joining us from the left coast. He's the head of the global public policy at Google, NC, your council there, and he has also taught at Harvard and is a senior fellow at the Berkman Center.

Speaker 3:          00:15:34       So I guess we're going to start our questions with column and the first one is, what do you think the optimal use case is for the Dni and against what situations is it built to work that well? So first, if I could just, um, thank you guys for inviting me here. I'm sure this will provide a lot more than my normal environment inside of asking you to gentle. I'm not used to being taken apart by the class. And second, important to let you know that I'm speaking on my own behalf. Not officially in anywhere. So we've done part of what we have and what a lot of us to create. The sort of trust that we have is through a great deal of caution with to speaking on behalf of the people. These were my experience.

Speaker 3:          00:16:26       Um, so kind of before it gets to your question, can I kind of just reflect on a few points in that? Please do. And I, I really wanted to highlight one which I thought was really interesting, sort of the focus on aspirational language and to say that that was very, that's a very intentional tension that we introduced. They're sort of on one hand saying what can we aspire to and uh, what's, what's something that's realistically implementable and ultimately verifiable. So I think you're pulling out tension in the beginning as a suite of documents as well as see that particular thing in that that in particular is important. So the question is, what's the ideal case? What's the ideal use case? One? Is the, there a specific case that he's looking over? My, it's fine. I guess I should say this, I'll start off with a question for you about, about, about human rights in general and your, these packs. Well, if you'd like. Okay. So where thing. We often talk as if there are, there are, you know, big categories as repetitive companies. Does it, does it simplify things, you know, tend to refer to just google different anyway, or should we, should we try it aggravated

Speaker 4:          00:18:13       state? She and I, uh, um, so, so it was both of us decided to do business in China town experience and Microsoft find that itself has been subjected to Chinese content controls on a, as a locally hosted service, uh, which, which I don't think it's the, um, was that, uh, that, uh, any one of these companies trying to Tino the government on its own is basically at a massive disadvantage and so worth it was a, we try to aggregate together a lot of market capital behind a basic set of principles and the, I can say in all honesty that this, this thing was my idea to begin with. So I can say what I was thinking when you started this off, the original idea was that there was one principal that I thought mattered and that was the idea that if we could get the companies to read too insistent, one basic rule of law process or censorship, we'd be able to introduce an element of accountability and also transparency in the censorship system.

Speaker 4:          00:19:48       So you got remember from a kind of global perspective for a company like Google anyway, what Chinese, what China does is an extreme form of lots of student. It's actually isn't an Obama in Europe this week. I gave a really interesting answer to a kind of snarky administrating this question about American exceptions and one of the things that he noted, which is absolutely true, is that one of the things that is very exceptional than the United States or in freedom of speech, we are in a global context and extreme outlier when it comes to detection, meaning speech. It's fair to say that there's no one to country which isn't really a metal all as protected as the US is of dissidence expression of uncomfortable expression of last expression and certainly even Canada or Australia countries which are in many ways culturally quite similar to ours, engage in Ireland, sponsored censorship in content in a way that would be recently a unconstitutional in United States.

Speaker 4:          00:20:52       So, um, so anyways, so many new roles. We as a company have gotten into your commute censorship in Germany and France, Brazil and the UK countries, which are democracies. And in which competed successive elective ordinance validated by the ballot box, have voted to moser maintain a censorship machines. So in Australia, in classify broadcast content, they've extended that stream. Theo in Canada, they're a national content rules will use to suppress speech from outside Canada and prepare the speech inside Canada. Germany suppresses a bouncy related stuff, extreme violence, um, uh, world, uh, evocations to go work. Um, uh, you know, I hate Fox News would probably be illegal in Germany, um, and, uh, and, and, and, and, and so on. So he, there are lots of jurisdictions where you have to do this. And what's different about training horses that aids our democracy and the, um, the range of speech that is suppressed, there goes well beyond sort of narrow defined categories to the arbitrary and unpredictable a range of subjects that they, that they choose to suppress and experience has shown that in China is, it's actually a short winded zone.

Speaker 4:          00:22:16       What is censored is, is much less today than it was say 10 or 12 years ago, maybe even five or six years now. Um, but there still is a broad range of things. The shorthand of it use the, a, the, a three season two teats or um, uh, are three t's and Tuesday's Tiananmen Square massacre. I wanted dependence to independence. The first C is with the last one is criticism with the communist party's says central leadership. So, um, those are the things that really got a internet content blocks. And uh, the problem is that there's no rule of law to. So if we leave aside the differences in political systems for a second and say, you know, what really distinguishes German censorship from Chinese censorship, what answer is that? German censorship happens in an accountable framework that's very well documented. The law follows the rule sets.

Speaker 4:          00:23:09       So, uh, in Germany there's a body, a governmental body which produces a black list. Are Else, is subject to oversight from different parts of the government so that they can make sure that this apple beyond the range of things that supposed to be blocking, it's got 12 experts from outside the agency that participative decision making and presumably could be whistleblowers and there was something bad going on. Um, and uh, the black dust itself is not published for fairly obvious reasons, um, a, the process by which it's implemented, it's pretty transparent. So I'm a, that's one alternative. The Chinese alternative though is there's rule of law. It's basically an individual decision being accountable. You're not documentation. So the, I cannot make the GI initially, like I say, because I first cooked it up was that you should try to get as much accumulated market capital in the tech sector, media sector and, uh, broadly speaking in the information center and try to get them all to agree to one second principle, which is, that really does follow a censorship requests on Chinese in services and actually follow the formal one.

Speaker 4:          00:24:21       So not for Prom, not somebody just sending you an employee to a meeting and yelling at them to block something. But if model document that's been signed off by court, um, and again, this could be usefully transformative at least in some small way and that requires some official to attach their name to an order that follows legal process at least on paper. And therefore there's a chain of accountability built in. Something gets why you can look at seafood was that ordered it to be. One of the things that the fuels, the range of censorship in China right now is that, you know, you can never really tell it's complete black box. The outside world ordered what and for what purpose? So that was the original idea. I'm just one question to ask was better, um, it should take. I think it's largely failed in that because the only two companies that are taking on Google or Yahoo and Microsoft, there are a couple others that I hope to see getting into the fall by the stampede and any interest in players where it's, this set of rules has not really happened.

Speaker 4:          00:25:27       And I think the rule set became a quite, a bit more prescriptive than what I just outlined because we also wanted to move on your recipes others and actually wanting to push the, uh, a formal requirements on participating companies because they thought they sorta had to companies over a barrel because congressional criticism, pleasure stage. Um, and so anyway, that's something that I broke is going to be useful, but it definitely has not lived up to be the second vibe, which was the other question you mentioned google basically the same as apple, Microsoft. Um, uh, probably not. I mean we, we, we, we are much for, were much more conservative than the countries that we opened up our operations in a much more conservative about the kinds of services that we deploy and how we deploy it. So in China, for example, we don't locate any personally identifiable data inside China, um, which is critical because even though it means that our services are quite a bit slower, um, it means that if the Chinese government never wanted to get personally identifiable data from us, they would have to go and file formal legal process through something called a mutual legal assistance treaty.

Speaker 4:          00:26:38       You are, which means that it goes government to government from China to the US, which is Davis, Ashley Stewart. Um, and then the US Justice Department is involved with the same thing. We, we're gauging cooperation. One of the critical things would be what the Chinese government is going to use this data for. Is it a political dissident or is it a child? Pornographer? Both are possible. US would obviously, I think one of the cooperate in an investigation of the latter than the former. Um, so anyway, that's, that's sort of what I know that a powerpoint that you sent around with, you were talking about Vietnam, the announced example country where we offer Vietnamese language services. We offer them on adopt 10 domain name, but we don't actually have any employees or operations inside China that's probably different from who was a Microsoft. Microsoft sells software, all the girls. And so their online division to probably.

Speaker 4:          00:27:35       I'm piggybacking off of this physical presence for us, we can be a lot more deliberative about it and they're chosen to be a separate. There are basically two things that we're extremely focused in any country where we're going to put people. One is access to user data and the second one is censorship. And so we study a, you know, sort of study the hell out of those two questions before we make any decisions about weeds. We're a data service facilities, storage facilities, um, and uh, you know, all different illusions country by country, I will say on the censorship score then what has been extremely challenging is that because we pulled from the United States, there is no country which means us levels of protection for free speech. There's a single one anywhere in the world. So every country that you go to this got subject each control or at least attempts through instruments like the liability provisions that goes beyond what would be acceptable know and kingdom, for example, it's libel, defamation laws, um, uh, and they just act as in order to do a rules of the liability.

Speaker 4:          00:28:46       They act as the speech control games. And that again, was just a difficult. So, you know, you're looking at a country. So for me personally, it's exactly accompanied view, but a critical distinguishing factor has been about which countries have democratic systems which are capable of correcting errors over time. So there's that I don't like about speech restriction laws in India, let's say a, but I'm comfortable with Google doing business in India because when it needs to state, which it sometimes does in the form of a police arresting somebody who posted the Oregon community that was critical as somebody for example, is of course incredibly dismaying that somebody would be arrested on the basis of criticism, on the other hand, a ideas democratic system for all of it's a force. It's a very robust wine in one with the court system, which at the top level is, we've already, this institution have a tremendous amount of integrity, a partial decision making and is likely to be able to prevent errors as into mature system. So I think the profession is probably unrealistic aiming for something which is workable, um, is, uh, is more realistic and try, just try some kind of balance.

Speaker 3:          00:30:05       Um, so one of the things Andrew mentioned that is that ai is only all has been going by too much. The company. Is that a metric to access your. So it is a new prevail. It doesn't have to be arrogant. Are we to kind of differences between people or companies or how would you respond to that? First, I would say that the official launch of the materials, which is to say the documents referred to in the presentation was in October of 2008. A public launch was in December of 2008. Uh, we have ongoing conversations with probably 20 companies. We've had a whole host of other kinds of non-company participants, which pushes me, uh, academics and gos and investment groups, but most of the social responsible investors, I think there's a lot more folks that we're likely to see. One of the things that we've been involved in is in drafting precisely the governance charter and the terms by which you can become a member.

Speaker 3:          00:31:15       So the idea was not that any, anyone would just join up. In fact, we need to establish that they were committed to this venture and to making it a success. One of the things that each of the companies that have been leading up to now I've demonstrated through their longterm commitment and meaningful engagement and actions and willingness to address this stuff publicly. A number of different ways that they really care about making this work and that's person not enough, but a very strong. There will be accountability. It's other mechanisms, but a very strong signal to their success or their seriousness with which when they're done with you. And I had the other thing I would say that, so Andrew referred to one sort of differences among the companies that are participating now. Um, what I would say is that indeed the point since the beginning has been to try to get a broader range because now admittedly we have not succeeded in that regard.

Speaker 3:          00:32:07       We did have a series of uh, other, other Internet service provider, a mobile provider and telco types from Europe primarily involved in the drafting process, but the variety of reasons didn't end up signing on, uh, we remain in good contact with them and never kind of sorta considered we'll see what happens in long term, but the plan had been and remains to ensure diversity and the diversity of the company so that you don't have folks using one kind of technology or one sort of business are operating in one country. But rather a mix so you don't end up with technology specific or region specific solutions that would not be as meaningful or as a, it would be sort of a to two specific. Of course there's the risk of becoming too broad, but that will allow for some sort of nuance in terms of meditation.

Speaker 3:          00:32:58       So I'm going for people in. Your challenge is to get in not just American companies. This is key, right? If we're going, we claim to be anything like approaching global, a drawing on the ICC bar. New EHR is not so willing to have, not just companies with global reach, but companies that have values based on non us and indeed non western value systems. We need to have a wider range of companies involved. So we need to have a telephone, we need to have other kinds of internet companies. We need to have the next Google or the next company that the social network would be another group or groups involved. So I think the criticism that we have not scaled, uh, we are at scale. Completely agree with that. To say that we. The fact that we haven't scaled this quickly needs, it's a failure. I would say that's an overstatement and that, you know, perhaps if Andrew had been around or that we would have more company, so maybe he'll help us get some other folks to sign on if you will. So we asked him to go back to window and I was just an idea, just an idea. Even if the had to deal with a lot of people, uh, what was the process like a tear there to sell it internally to people at Google? Um, what, what will be most conservatives couldn't accomplish quality st death as yet unfortunately. Treatment, what would it be concerned is what I'm drawn out.

Speaker 4:          00:34:26       Most of the concerns with it. It just to be too late and too useless and will be sort of like a pr. A fig leaf for companies was worse practices than ours. I'd say that's probably the primary thing that we had to.

Speaker 3:          00:34:40       What's your biggest weakness? You work too hard.

Speaker 4:          00:34:45       I just care too much. But, you know, the, you know, the, the sales job that we had to, um, that we had to, uh, you know, sort of do one on the two guys who started the goal was to, um, you know, was to persuade them that this wasn't just sort of like putting people's weight behind a PR exercise that was more important to the other participants that loves to us on the other concern which was student process was on as a publicly traded company on the idea of having sort of outside auditors go crawling through the company every couple of years. Uh, to judge our compliance with standards is not one, it's not one that the lawyers who deal with no obligations will tcs to get back. So we had to cook up a compliance mechanism which would be, you know, just recently trust building but not so intrusive to trigger a bunch of alarms, alarm bells in that cereal, serial informational material, non public information coming out into the public in a way, that kind of thing. You're not supposed to do this training from.

Speaker 1:          00:36:07       Oh. So I see some questions from the audience. Um, so I've always been struck by your observation that if you keep data in the US, you can tie governance like the Chinese government in knots trying to get to it with letters rogatory and mutual assistance and enforcement trees and such. Because I always seemed to me that if there were some data that the US government had reason to think that Google health does it interest to the government here, and Google's answer was it's in China, don't talk to them. I think the US government would say, well go talk to this contempt citation, you know, it would be, you'd just arrest the people who are on us term and say, all right, we're going to keep you in jail until you talked to the Chinese and get them to give you the information. And I always wondered, isn't the same true on the training side of things that they, as long as you've got boots on the ground engineer's there, the Chinese can pull your license. Current restaurant engineer's insert all sorts of pressure for violating their domestic law. If you failed to turn over information. So how big a difference does it make that the data is physically on some other server?

Speaker 4:          00:37:22       So it's, it's really good question and either that better example than China's sale because actually the facility gets indicted the head of our Brazil operation because we were not surrendering a user, David, that was helpful on servers in the US. One thing difference between the US and every other country is that because we're headquartered in the US, it means that all of the subsidiaries outside the United States are controlled by the US. One of the, uh, the converse is not true. The local subsidiaries elsewhere do not control the operation in the United States. Um, but even so with what with resilience did was they were interested in getting data about people that they claim they felt child pornographers, so people that were trading bad images in working. So I know that background. Google runs as a sort of strange 20 percent engineering time project and social working, um, which nobody in the United States a citizen, but especially in Brazil in particular, to a degree that no service, the United States where they're certain virtually everybody on the Internet as we're good accounts and they use it to keep in touch with each.

Speaker 4:          00:38:34       I, I have some theories about why that was it. It's awesome. Brazil actually, the Berkman center is at the heart monitor them because three of the people who were kind of like ground zero users for the Internet in Brazil were up 49 law. I'm a add to Berkman center and later went back. This is our kaminsky ended up when all of us and one other guy and they certainly became a part of the working group anyways, so hard work it takes off down there. But anyways, so Jonathan, I believe, uh, but uh, so the working community sort of really takes off and becomes a big deal in Brazil and um, uh, people were using it for everything that you used the Internet for. Right? So if you're using it to share child porn images, they were using it to engage in racist tribes that were using it to, uh, uh, you know, do all the good things that you know about, but they're also easy to do the bat.

Speaker 4:          00:39:27       So Google's a posture has always been to never engage others, sort of control over content, but rather to be a platform and respond reactively when users flag things that are against our terms are against the law of this stuff will be out there and it would often be there, you know, for law enforcement officials to capture screenshots and then mom and complainants. And so, uh, there were um, you know, both things which were illegal in the United States, like childhood, you know, we just did the letter, um, uh, taking place to work and then there were also fixed that we're not going to be in that state. So that would be, for example, racism. So, uh, there were no police trying to pursue, uh, the greeters of racists, uh, groups in Brazil and angry. We meet, we read an impasse, impassable. We told him that they had to go use an a and m black mechanism to get the data cooperation with the United States.

Speaker 4:          00:40:21       They told us so, you know, we're gonna make, we're gonna arrest her people in jail and so forth. And indeed they did indict ahead of personal obligation and extremely uncomfortable a situation for instance. So we ended up doing was basically set up a server inside Brazil and copies of child porn images and stuff worth onto that server so that it's actually physically subject to jurisdiction and wouldn't be violating US law by channel data outside of the bounds of legal process. Um, and uh, that's standard office suite works. But, um, and we also, you know, if the problem is now the problems that the United States law speced specifies that that will be discovered. A child born in HR systems somewhere. He notified the FBI, which gives you and that you're sharing that eventually a organization called the National Center for missing exploited children, which is a great organization to an executive and financially and they do excellent sort of forensic work out on the Internet to try to track people down and it couldn't trust, but they'll also is very.

Speaker 4:          00:41:38       That is the only organization that we are legally allowed to treat. These images have overtaken. And so, uh, you know, we had to sort of go through a process of getting a, getting a kind of an okay for us to have these images are shared. We the resilient law enforcement and impossible. This is just a silly law. It just needs to be fixed because there's no point in saying that to us. These are forbidden from sharing a legal activity elsewhere if law enforcement elsewhere. Um, but, uh, it was a question that you asked is what's the socket just arresting and invoice? The answer's nothing. I mean, they, they, they did do that. The problem is that, you know, you start to look like a hostel and unreasonable environment for investments and for Internet companies to operate. One advantage that we have is that even police chiefs and government officials in districts and countries like and using, um, and find that it's useful so they, they're often not particularly interested in going the nuclear rooms and pulling her licenses, kicking us out of the country and resting air holes.

Speaker 3:          00:42:47       So let's, uh, let's change topics a little bit and so, um, say when you mentioned the foundation Congress last term was paying a bill called Blah Blah Blah. And that was, that took a different coach than, uh, than, uh, than the Gi. But for all, for this question, just all you know is that you're not anymore and I will never been. I wouldn't say so. Let's say the Congress instead, he says you'll have some kind of APP. It says American companies doing business abroad. He's accurate. He sent me to a sign up for it. What happened is that, is that an APP? Let's see. It will be up to us to make it into that. But I think, you know, as of right now, it would be a little difficult to go from having three companies and a total of 20 participants invest with the scale required level adjustment on one hand, upside down, some of our notions with respect to governance and cool and underworlds firms, they agree to participate.

Speaker 3:          00:44:02       So I think that's an adjustment that you make in terms of the, um, but that's, that's more process oriented. I think in terms of the, um, the guidelines said the patient better and so forth. It would absolutely skill. I mean, this is giving me maybe for all his criticism as to the rule of law, of course, that's a significant part of the GNA and to introduce process is where there has been no process which has been a major heading, a profoundly negative impact on you. Um, so in many respects this would be a great game, right? To have everyone participating in this, uh, a snap of the other things you do is, is that as we have a greater number of participants in more diverse markets around the world, it gives us the opportunity to have a greater transparency so that instead of just asking Google to release this block list or it's sort of statistics which it's been, it may be elected to do for, it could in fact highlights behavior in front of a certain document, either compliance or lack of compliance to aggregate collectively the statistics of the number of different, uh, the number of different companies to get the show to both policymakers, users, activists, and others.

Speaker 3:          00:45:22       In fact, what's happening so, so move away from censorship. Censorship is a problem or a privacy, your privacy, your private information. It's not really safe towards saying this is how unsafe it is or this is how big a problem with this is the trend. In fact, we're seeing greater and greater amounts of censorship or we're not really. Maybe it's this. Andrew says it's actually other problem is that is finishing. So that one of the, one of the sort of medium term goals with Gsi, which is the rule of law, is to generate this kind of data so that we can actually have empirical information about what's happening and that then a citizens users, uh, atmosphere organizations, companies and policy makers can make choices based on that information.

Speaker 4:          00:46:06       So make a note about that. So as censorship is not diminishing or why should, I think we're experiencing right now, a massive surge all fly expansion in censorship. It's not interestingly, it's not happening in China. It's happening again in a vast swath of countries in western Europe, on Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and so forth. I'm sure you had. Your country is now attempting to impose restrictions on the Internet in the name of copyright, in the name of child protection, in any combat and indigo activity and in the case of many telcos in the name of a differentiating services and, and in a fast and slow lanes for different kinds of content. Um, so from, from my perspective, actually, this is a, a gathering storm seating. And, um, I think for the US government, this is something that needs to be taken very serious. I'm leaving aside the exportability of American values like freedom of expression in the old tradition of John Mark and John Stuart Mill Constitution.

Speaker 4:          00:47:26       Uh, we have an economic interest in that information center which generates a lot of cash and jobs to be kind of embracing about it is this, this is the single biggest trade barriers we faced. Um, so I actually think that the perspective of either legislation or executive action for both, there's a pretty wide. So it's worth considering and see if the United States can use. It's a whatever remains our economic power worldwide. All in the service of freedom of expression offer individuals worldwide cause it's in the interest of our movie industry or a TV or newspaper industry's Internet companies. And so we've all got an interest in being able to move information without a enduring. The, um, uh, uh, many complex and expensive censorship regime center are, many of them are very well intentioned that they're not going to traditional where, uh, you know, adults autonomy is not a, it's not the prevailing value rather than freshman social values, um, is, uh, so I actually just there another big fan of the name which would be this building highlighted, for example, on an basis barely make it illegal for us to deliver it in an email message to China because of the way it's written.

Speaker 4:          00:48:50       But, you know, even leaving that aside, I think there probably are things to be get you to try to raise the bar, a little wall in center, our trading partners, uh, to create a, an environment in which our companies are edited, uh, regardless of, uh, of, of censorship restrictions

Speaker 5:          00:49:16       against the background of that last comment, which seems strong. It's not at all clear to me why you think that reliance on the foundational principle of the rule of law is going to help. It would seem just discussed the alternatives scenario for moment still there because you just disappeared from the screen now. There we are.

Speaker 4:          00:49:37       Yeah, I'm here. I can hear you. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:49:39       So the alternative scenarios, one image you've combined the increased willingness of governments to, um, to engage in overt forms of censorship with the trend exemplified most recently by the Goldsmith book acknowledging the technical feasibility of country specific management in such an environment. It would seem that the rule of law, uh, to the extended connotes open processes of making an independent judiciaries is not going to do anything to retard the imposition of controls on speech. It just have legislatures in Saudi Arabia is saying actually we think sexualities and bad idea and the judges appropriately commissioned to execute the law say, and we think sexuality is a bad idea and we're going to clamp down on it. So why is there any advantage to employing the mechanisms of the rule of law to resist the coming storm? It

Speaker 4:          00:50:42       so is in a structural answer of rule of law and accountability and transparency answers you struck with Scott, unaccountable, nontransparent, secretive, the structural answer that answered substances, just social consensus. As a group censorship, that means you still also have to add the substantive arguments and build a substantive case why he should not attempt to the memory of Kemal Ataturk or protect community shake you. I think that it's an answered you didn't problem. And so I can engage in, in a, in a series of arguments possibly to economic and diplomatic. It's a to do subsequent.

Speaker 5:          00:51:37       Can you vote for questions here?

Speaker 6:          00:51:42       So now you've got a little bit of background on the issues in a democratic cross international borders and a that we're going to make you do it. So welcome everyone to the first international conference on Democratic Free Speech Online. It is a build on facts because we ended up last week that, um, there is a recent case in which a, a, a Vietnamese missive to Internet service within Vietnam telling them which sites are blocked was given out to various products. We didn't have a staff member of one of the Vietnamese Internet service providers blog about the list of blocked sites on his, um, his pro-democracy blog published by Yahoo, which is the most popular blogging service in Vietnam today. That was picked up by Rebecca Mackinnon global voices, which is a popular, a Franchisor of individual for an auction, bloggers around the world, and that wasn't picked up by the New York Times, New York Times story upset that the enemy is government.

Speaker 6:          00:53:07       Government in turn has come together to ask them to give up the names of the people who were blogging this information. Now, uh, it turns out this is the backdrop for a group of international actors getting together and saying, we see this problem far too often. We'd really like to come up with a solution that's going to allow all of us to be satisfied with procedures that we have for dealing with these problems. So we are going that each of you, your six groups, and I should name the six groups right now, the government of Vietnam here, we have a group of Vietnamese Burnham auction bloggers. You can just assume we're all wearing masks. So the government of Vietnam doesn't spot on and take them home right now. Um, the United States Congress, a reputable August dissertation, um, the Board of international and convincing just because they like look up the shoulders with their friends again, China.

Speaker 6:          00:54:11       So, uh, right now what we'd like you to get to do is take five minutes, discuss what it is that you'd like to see as your actor in and sort of an international system for dealing with these kinds of problems as they arise. Each group should elect someone to act as a communications director. That person should, a laptop, then we're going to engage in two rounds of sending people to other people's vacation is director or from various parties, negotiate over the agreement that every part of the commitment. So for example, we would take amnesty, Amnesty were to relax, you know, room to be director, and then we send them over to various other groups can negotiate with them over terms and everyone can agree with to come back to their communications director and to write it into the final document that Amnesty International, uh, we're going to have a second round of meetings within the group. You can discuss what you heard from anyone else. And a second round of negotiations and then each group is going to present it solution and explained to us first why it thinks it's a good solution for it's so valuable. Why Amnesty International in particular sport the EMC solution, and then liked good solutions of the gen and it's sort of a desirable overall answer. So with that in mind, I'm going to give you five minutes starting now. She can sit with your groups, discuss exactly what you're negotiating strategy conveyed and I'll let him know.

Speaker 7:          00:56:00       So the idea here is that not only that but also to win the vote.

Speaker 6:          00:56:07       Which solution is the best solution. So when you got here negotiating for your needs, you're also negotiating. Our first presentation is going to be,

Speaker 7:          00:56:24       you guys want to spend two minutes, why you for you?

Speaker 8:          00:56:40       Apparently I'm not so much into free speech, which is probably a, but we're essentially DMTA style. Notice the take down because we recognize that the Vietnamese government is never going to allow us to just post whatever we want online. So it exchange for this Cape Town. We were asking for the right to remain anonymous and that will also get immunity from criminal penalties. And so why we thought this matter interest are interesting word that one you have to post. Um, and we also though, we don't want to make Vietnam too bad because we want economic growth. So that's what I mean.

Speaker 7:          00:57:41       The second group that we got was a Yahoo International. We'd like to present yet Yahoo, the greatest collaboration with the Vietnamese and the Chinese government game, the following solution, finding arbitration underneath the existing, the World Trade Organization Rishi, such that if the government has a problem, if the Vietnamese bloggers have a problem, they can bring it to the attention of his international body. The governments will have signed onto the GSI and principle and we can have a binding arbitration's that uses the economic, carrot and stick of the WTO arbitration per blog post. Important general class action arbitration. The

Speaker 1:          00:58:56       details are that each country wouldn't have their own boss. That basically kind of caught up by their interpretation of Gina. Both Vietnam and China agreed in principle to kind of aspire towards Dni principles in, in respecting privacy, so in each individual case there will be processes and procedures and laws and the Chinese in China and Vietnam which be independent and respect their sovereignty now in extreme cases to the extent that either party it the government or the blogger has a a major kind of dispute. There would then be in a process by which the either party could appeal these extreme cases to the WTO in that arbitration would inviting under the WTO of which both is there a two inch, both Vietnam and China already kind of our members, the exchange of information. Really a trade issue here and that's that. So the idea is that not that not only not only respects the sovereignty of both of China and Vietnam, which we think are paramount, but it also kind of creates an international, a set of principles that other countries can aspire to, which is, which is what the Gi represents.

Speaker 1:          01:00:15       Hopefully this will keep other countries to kind of start using guidelines, guiding principles in addition to the fact that it kind of respects the privacy of the bloggers and the interest of groups like Amnesty International and finally, truly I think we think expands the global economic high nine zero seven transactions. That's what we're about. We're with launch with the WTO, not for being a disciplined and being arrested for that, but for having his information turnovers in future cases. There would be a procedure in place for dealing with situations like this. You try to because that's extremely. Yes. Alright, gentlemen, the next up, the Chinese have a presentation or proposal. I'm not sure I actually agree with you, was pretty sort of the WTO. Um, we don't really. Our main proposal is that we think that countries should agree to adopt the United Nations on Peachtree Hispanic program being dropped to about [inaudible] 70. Um, beyond that, I think our position is that we're not going to have a sign on the agreement here no matter what. Basically has it all, um, as, as an interstate matters from the wheel bolts, it's commitments to letting countries do what they want within their own borders and not having other countries dictate to 100 dictate to another country what they should be doing. So is there anything here, but we won't sign on to anything

Speaker 6:          01:02:18       that we don't with that is imposing on our, our society, someone else's. So now no international arbitration is going to satisfy if it's not binding, said Cheryl, we might sign onto that. Fair enough or it could be like the US and even if it is binding and we started going through and just ignore what it says that, but that sounds reasonable. The United Nations a q, six, 17 group life. Yeah. That's alright. Next up we'd like to hear from the United States Congress. So we realized that, um, there are a lot of definitions of state sovereignty play here, which is why, um, that, uh, we set up some sort of ex ante procedure, uh, in order to determine what sorts of information requests are really justified by telling me which ones aren't. Uh, so we propose a recording either a committee or, or, um, an official within the US State Department who would review requests, formal

Speaker 6:          01:03:41       requests, uh, from, uh, uh, the relevant government, um, uh, to determine whether there exists a compelling need for information such as a, uh, a realistic connection to some sort of terrorist activity. Uh, and if such a need exists to then authorize the ISP, our ISP is in question to a handover, the relevant information to, uh, the request and government, uh, the ISP is, would not be subject to penalties, uh, in this country unless they hand over information that has not already been authorized by the government. Otherwise, the US or the US government. Otherwise, all negotiation, uh, all interaction interactions take place on a state to state level, but all the information that would go, all the permission, we'll go through this committee. So any information that was turned over to governments that didn't go through this committee would not be authorized by Congress government. Uh, yes, with the symmetric interpretation now he had put in our original legislation that we got some feedback,

Speaker 8:          01:05:18       um, many of these companies in a very difficult position where they would either be forced to define local laws are approved by our laws and we thought it would be in the interest of bloggers and democratic decisions around the world to have the tool of the internet at their disposal instead having yahoo just leave the country for fear of reprisal from whatever dictatorship. So we've got that by keeping this in the diplomatic sphere and by not trying to harness the economic incentives that Isp, we would actually be doing a greater service to people who wanted to use the internet.

Speaker 3:          01:05:59       The American government wanted to get information that will poses overseas against the wishes. Say they're with us, recede on applying pressure of the sort that Andrew was talking about. Contempt of court for those assets are people we can get our hands on. They have a process like this place

Speaker 7:          01:06:32       that's classified the US Congress now Amnesty International. So

Speaker 3:          01:06:47       our proposal is based on this principle that when it gets into trouble, a large number of parties who support the rights, including a state and non state actors, should have taken interest in exercising all our necessary to defend that blogger. So that starts with us setting up a network of pro bono lawyers in every country who works specifically with local laws concerning speech and also lobbying governments to strengthen some sort of private right of action, which is worthless when you're a blogger who's secretly arrested, um, but does do a little something towards establishing international norms. We visualize the process is working on those Vietnam complaints and Yahoo alerts the blogger and get the water a chance to correct false information or pull the post. And I think we saw some agreements on the idea of pulling the post and Yahoo alert sauce and we activate our network of pro bono lawyers so that this anonymous blogger has some legal representation in their home state. Um, and then we'd have a review board possibly based in the WTO that might include a mechanism for anonymous mediation between the Vietnamese government and the blogger who's in trouble, although we know that there's a risk of espionage here in anonymous mediation. Um, the board could later can include the TNI countries and maybe if, if things are really not going include other interests in nations, hopefully United States.

Speaker 3:          01:08:21       So the idea is that we can really just make this issue explode on the international level, make an international incident out of one nation, attempts to get to a single blogger. I'm, we'd also like to see an extension to the GSI that would mandate that all these companies participating in protecting speech rights online could work together and collectively bargain with say, the Vietnamese government. So the nuclear option would look a little something like this. Vietnam says turnover. Yahoo, who says no negotiations totally fail. Things are going very badly. Microsoft, Google and Yahoo unilaterally pull all surfaces out of Vietnam, which isn't awful for Vietnam in terms of being competitive in a global market.

Speaker 1:          01:09:05       Um, I think that's what a lot of state right now, so. Okay. And then our final group is Vietnam. Sure. So I'll start. Um, we, we talked to a good number of parties and that we feel very strongly that yahoo was obliged to turnover a blogger on the, a state secret with a. We do not believe that we move into post remedies. The problem that we do with the blogger, no more than we gave. Julia said, Ethel Rosenberg, oopsies. I'm making that up, that this is a no, no, no more than anyone would have done. This is a very serious matter.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       This is a, this is something that requires that judicial system of Vietnam going. The fact that we believe that we offered you processed by our laws, that we have all of the procedures, that we are willing to comply with the best practices of the GSI and for future forward looking proposals including modifying the underlying infrastructure of the internet or have proven to WTO. We were willing to take these proposals very seriously. We just joined the WTO two years ago that we are country with very low internet presence. And so we are not willing at this time to commit ourselves to a abrogating any jurisdiction, um, and we are in fact willing to tell the other if it's unwilling to follow the laws no differently than if they decided not to follow the minimum wage laws. We are comfortable proceeding against the company for violating our last, um, and that we, we believe that there was some agreement that so long as the country follows the piece of law certainly does that she and I have principals are respected and that this is something that I think a lot of parties agree to. A little bit of feedback on.

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       Some of the ideas we've gone here and then we're going to take a boat. Um, so, uh, first the DVCA style notes and take a. So I thought, let me just start. Okay, go and think those are very creative ideas and I will certainly take them back towards you. And I know I'm going to take a little while to process that. The DNC was definitely interesting. I liked how you kinda came up with the tradeoffs. You just sort of that benefit. I'm not sure that the Vietnamese government is necessarily going to be really thrilled with that and it's. I mean, I certainly love the idea of preserving anonymity, but from what we've heard about the Vietnamese government, they may not necessarily. They may have other ways of knowing who you are, so I'm not sure that you're really going to preserve your referring to key loggers and other trojans and this precise.

Speaker 3:          01:12:14       I'm trying to remember what the Vietnamese isp situations, but my recollection is that there's, there's a pretty close tie to the government in a lot of instances. I'm not sure how they're gonna feel about it, but certainly it seems like a good start to see, well if there is a problem and someone does say, Hey, I want to blow the whistle on this does scale unlike some of these other solutions which I think are going to have a real challenge with scaling. Um, whether there's potential for abuse in the DSCA style thing. And certainly people have argued that there have been abuses in the US of a, on that front end therapy. Similarly in these context. So what about international arbitration? When Debbie came back, there were some up. The trade issue is interesting and this is certainly something that the companies have pursued. I don't know that anyone has really felt that adding it into WTO, maybe tim mover and paper that was advocated for epic adding into WTO, but my suspicion is the scaling issue is one problem.

Speaker 3:          01:13:15       How does it work? How does it work in practice when you have a pretty substantial number of actual replaces a possible, when you have a legitimate law enforcement, how do you determine the difference between those two things? What does it mean? I think you guys also had government signing on the GSI. I have no clue without looking in practice if a lot of it's about responsible company behavior piece of it's interactions with governments rather than responsible government behavior, which it shouldn't be falling in some of the US anyway, that somebody or perhaps that universal declaration, declaration of human rights to. It's mostly, I assume that I have to be quite frank. Um, and uh, I think the value of women within Dni, there is a venue for complaint. There is a third party complaint mechanism that we're working on right now, so I had a that needs to be some space, but I'm not convinced that the WTO, which hasn't arguably been super kind to some countries, wouldn't really do the best place.

Speaker 3:          01:14:18       I'm sure they do. I is that Chinese book before the International Telecommunications Union to retrofit the Internet so that all communications are traceable. It's proceeding for studying from now until 2012 for the Chinese herbalist. Very hard and ACB and finger in this class as well. I mean, so I guess to the rest of new attorneys may have this already involved in mind, but I think what you would see as sort of always seen with a lot of other technologies that there would be scope creep and uh, what you might, when you start out with your filtering or sensory activity, you begin to filter out or filter or search for child porn only. And then child porn moves into kind of other objectional speech. Like, I don't know, the political opposition or different ideas of religion. So forth. And I think you could see very likely a scope creep with this. I also wonder, I mean, so that's the scary side. The other side is I tend to be a juvie excited the fold that any technology fixed will remedy anything that there's always going to be a technology fix. Um, and uh, perhaps that identify you by your, you're a very noble aims, but perhaps it's enough if you can make people think that they can be traced that sufficient.

Speaker 3:          01:15:43       Congress is committee that looks out for every single piece of intervention. So that to me sounded sounded very boastful. Like if my recollection of the bill is accurate in that same, he seems like it would be pretty difficult to practice. My recollection is that piece and the international legal processes like this, another defer to the lawyers in the room and all of which you and me is that you're looking at a few years currently to get many of these sorts of questions resolved. So going from a few years to being able to resolve the volume of questions, not just from Vietnam but from all the other countries around the world would seem like the presenting the real challenge and I think Jonathan's questions as to what's the flip side of this is real important that we could end up in a similar situation we have to eat on go what about a industry international network of pro bono lawyers in secret ucl as well. So there were definitely some fun elements of, and Mystique is all about fun.

Speaker 3:          01:17:03       Yeah. Criticism and it didn't seem there was a lot of stick which we would expect, but I liked it. I thought the Yahoo alerting blogs. Interesting. I mean, I think it depends on the jurisdiction, but most places I think it's generally illegal and you guys got to get it corrected. If I'm wrong to alert someone that law enforcement has requested their, uh, information, unless it's for a civil procedure in which some cases. So my suspicion is that that's probably depending on whose laws to follow that could present some problems for them. Um, but, uh, I, I like that as a way of saying is there some way that we can work and try to remedy this situation internally? The lobbying government doesn't necessarily strike me as something that's gonna go too far since that's already happening right now, but perhaps it might institute some change, um, ended up Bono provolone or whereas is interesting. I think it would be pretty neat if you could get lawyers to sign on to do that. But of course what we've seen in a good number of countries is reprisals against those lawyers. And this is often a lot of settings which we want our jurisdiction. I'm sure you do.

Speaker 3:          01:18:33       But I also do think, I don't think you want them to their option. I don't think you want. I think that within your government there are a lot of different factions and some, maybe I'm more dug in on this sort of control and others in fact may be open to a more progressive approach and might find it. And I suspect that this is always the case. We'd like to talk about governance is monolithic, but that in fact there's more variety or more diversity of views in the government that if the these companies were to lose or there were to be or to leave or if there were to be a large international dispute that it would cost you some and certainly your relationship with the US. Well, I supposed to. China is significant in terms of the economic terms and I don't think while you don't necessarily want to bend over backwards to please the Congress, um, you at the same time, we're probably not eager to, um, to cause some major international so they wouldn't take a vote. Executive catching over my two minutes already. I'm thinking perhaps take a boat over the class. Any of your feedback on hold you here any longer than we actually happen. So thank you very much for participating.

Speaker 7:          01:19:45       Thank you.
