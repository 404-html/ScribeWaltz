Speaker 1:          00:04          Um, I think they are friends. Um, I think what's troubling to the American Jewish community troubling to me is I think there's been a change of strategy. And I think that comes as a result of the fact that, um, the United States today is facing a major challenge in the world. It's not Russia, it's not China, it's not Chavez. It's, um, it's the Arab Muslim world. We're at war America's at war with two Muslim countries. We baby at warroad a third. Um, not all Muslims are terrorists, but most artists are Muslims. It's a major challenge for the U S and, um, I think what we're seeing in this administration is an effort to deal with it. And I think part of that effort is this notion of linkage that if you could only solve the Arab Israel conflict, Messiah will come in the Middle East. And it's that notion, that analysis that is motivating American policy.

Speaker 1:          01:10          And so, um, yeah I think friends, but I think when the president went to the Middle East is stumble Cairo Rehab three times he was in a neighborhood of Jerusalem, didn't visit Jerusalem, sent the wrong message, sent a message that we're reaching out to the Arab Muslim world at the expense of our friendship or relationship with Israel. I've been focusing on settlements without focusing on Palestinian incitement and stuff was another mistake. So I think what we're seeing is a policy which sees itself distancing the United States from Israel in order to reach out and in some manner to the Arab Muslim world. I don't think it's worked. And so many of the Jewish community have been concerned that this nuance or non nuance changed as is as is. And I believe as I indicated earlier, is hurting prospects. That piece, cause if Israel does not feel that it's only ally continues to be its friend event, it will not risk.

Speaker 1:          02:19          It will not compromise to the extent that it has. And if you take a look at it, and during the Bush administration, whether you like Bush or not, the first president to come out for a Palestinian state with Bush. Why? Because Israel trusted him. And, uh, Sharon trusted him to the point that when, when President Bush announced appellate that America's for a Palestinian state, prime minister, Sharon leftist political party because they were opposed, um, disengagement from Gaza happened under Bush, um, the Annapolis. So when it's closer, now we have no talks and in Palestinians and Israelis are talking through proximity, which is their 15 kilometers away, nine miles away. And I've got to talk through the United States.
