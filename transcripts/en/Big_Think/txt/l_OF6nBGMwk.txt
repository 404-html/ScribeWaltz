Speaker 1:          00:00          No, I started this whole project by looking at Ed. Okay. Keep it in the data and writing the blog that I did and hopefully will one day do it again very soon. Um, and it's the best data center in the world cause it's people, all strangers. I'll making judgments of one another all probably trying to sleep with each other, which is also adds a certain, uh, pick one see to the whole thing. Um, so you know, you, you look at the data and you, you, you really get a kind of special window into people's psyche. Got, we kind of like, you could see everything that was going on in a big bunker on a Friday night. And you know, you see that, that men are the kind of pursuers and relationships that have four to one ratio. And it kind of correspondingly, uh, you know, women because they're getting four messages to everyone they send out, like they respond a lot less.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Um, and, and response rates to track directly with how hot the writer was is a, but then you also see that once people start talking, um, and they established a rapport, which for Okcupid is for converse at four, four messages going back and forth, that attracting, this kind of goes out the window. At that point, your personality takes over after the fourth message. Um, you see that, uh, in general women's opinions of men's looks like, and, and I get an on average is about half of what men's opinions of women's looks are. So they kind of get a 50% discount just ice cold. Uh, on tinder it's actually a lot more, it's something like a 10, a 10% discount or 90% discount. Sorry, the other way they go at 10th. Um, so these environments, I think this is, I can't prove this. My intuition is that the more sexual and environment, the larger that discount, um, from, from men to women or from women to men.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Okay. Cuba's userbase in theory on paper is as liberal as you could ever want it to be. You know, you ask people if they're a Democrat, if they're progressive, yes, yes, yes. You know, two, three, two, one. Um, we're all highly coastal, very little red state, very blue and a piece of paper. Okay. Keep, it should be a very progressive place. And maybe it is because who knows what the rest of the world is like, but the data that we have, you know, black users get three quarters of the messages, the, the, the positive votes, uh, the, the, their, their attractions ratings or three quarters of an average white user, um, or, or Latino user for that matter. Um, they reply to about three quarters of the time it's pretty blanket. Um, Asian men also get a similar discount but not Asian women. And then you go and you look at at date hookup, which is a site we run, um, you look@thedataformaster.com you'll see the exact same patterns.

Speaker 1:          02:29          Maybe not in the exact same ratios, but the same basic up, down. Yes. No pattern. When you compare any race with another race, and it's kind of suggested, it's kind of a once a universal in the sense of permanent pattern, but it's certainly like I state of affairs right now in the American psyche. I mean, and these three, those three sites alone, um, you know, that they registered maybe 30 million people in the United States last year. So it's not like some small sample. I mean that's about half of the single and looking people in the country to my best guess to the, if you look at the census numbers, so you know, it's, it's, it's pretty meaningful. Um, and, and pretty depressing thing to kind of digest, you know, insofar as like Grindr or any of these other sites, they're kind of hookup apps are hookup apps for gay men.

Speaker 1:          03:13          Okcupid is a little bit more of the relationship side and we have a very strong, um, gay userbase men, male and female, and you know, so we get to look at their patterns and you know, they're basically the same as straight patterns, you know, which I think is meaningful in the context of marriage equality because it certainly the pre marriage relationships seem about the same when you actually go and look at the data, which I think is, you know, a strong argument for any type of relationship being held apart legally for sure. Right? Um, I think the most significant thing that people do on OK cupid because it's a precursor to going out, going home with somebody, getting into a relationship with somebody getting married, any of that stuff is just messaging. Right? And we found some kind of crazy stuff like, uh, it doesn't really matter how long your messages, you know, the, the best messages are very short, 40 to 50 characters.

Speaker 1:          03:59          But by best, you know, they're, they get a reply 2120 2% of the time and kind of all messages get a reply. Maybe 19, 20% of the time. So it's not like a massive increase. Um, it does help you to spend a little bit more time on your message. We put a little script to just track the time since the composition window opened. And so if you put a little bit more effort into your master's per character, uh, it will yield slightly better results. But again, you know, it's, it's, it's not a huge effect. So we were, we were surprised at both of those things. I thought that longer messages we either do super badly or do super well and that if you spend a lot of time, at least on your message, it would do better than something you just like and type it and go, you know, um, as a writer, it's a little sad to say, but it kinda comes down to just think it does in person.

Speaker 1:          04:46          There's so much like first impression, which online is your picture, frankly, you know, um, that your actual words aren't as relevant as you probably wish they were. So to that point, you know, people being the kind of like intuitive to people and math being the intuitive genius is that they are the wisdom of the crowds or whatever. You know, you have like 20% of messages from guys to women are copy and pasted from other messages that the guys have sent. They just, they found something that for whatever reason either works or typifies them or that they like or whatever it is, and they just tricking, just blast it out, you know. Um, and those actually they do worse. Um, they do but not that much worse. They do like 70, 75% of of a normal message, theoretically unique message. Um, and so you get it, it's very easy to arrive at, at the, uh, results per unit effort is like sky high, just cut and pasting.

Speaker 1:          05:38          Right? And so we at that probably will be something that increases over time and we don't, we, we thought about trying to kind of, it's very easy for us to know whether a message has been cut and pasted from another message. Obviously right now you just compare it. Um, but we just decided to let those things go because, you know, it's, it's, it's just the online equivalent of, of people having their favorite anecdote about themselves, or this one time they got into this crazy bar fight or I don't know, some dumb story how I got the scar, that kind of thing in a bar or just like a standard pickup line that you might use. So it's one of these things that the online version of it seems very weird and kind of unsavory to be like, oh, this do just sent the same message to like 40 people. But I've probably told the same story. Everybody that I'm friends with, it's probably heard a large set of the same stories from me, you know, and it's something that people just do.

Speaker 2:          06:24          Okay.
