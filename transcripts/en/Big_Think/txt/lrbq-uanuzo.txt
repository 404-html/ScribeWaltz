Speaker 1:          00:05          Here's why I wrote big guns. I had served in Congress for 16 years and in those 16 years, um, I witnessed a shooting at a university in Virginia shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado, shooting at a nightclub in Orlando, shooting at an elementary school, uh, in Connecticut. And after every single one of those mass shootings, I in virtually every one of my colleagues were confronted with the same question. And that is when is congress going to do something about it? When will this stop? Not necessarily when we'll converse to everything about it, but just do something, do universal background checks or, uh, some common sense legislation. And when my constituents in New York would ask that question, I knew that the honest answer and the painful answer was we're not, congress is not going to do anything because of the politics that surrounded the gun safety debate.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And I decided to try and answer that question in the best way I can. And that is, uh, with snark, uh, with humor. And from the very inside of Congress, I wrote this book during hearings on gun safety. I wrote this book on the floor of the House of Representatives. I wrote this book on that little balcony off the floor of the House of Representatives where members go to rest while they're not beating each other up, uh, inside. And so this book is really, it's reflection of what I learned as a member of Congress. And it is my way of explaining to readers why Congress seems so paralyzed in the face of this mass violence, uh, that is affecting so many communities. And so many of our constituents, 90% of the American people support strengthened background checks of about 80% of Republicans support, strengthened background checks. A majority of NRA members support strengthened background checks.

Speaker 1:          01:58          And yet when we offered this amendment for stronger background checks and the appropriations committee, it was defeated, uh, virtually in a party line vote. And I was wrestling with this. Why would members of Congress vote against something that has such massive support? Well, I learned the lesson and the lesson is reflected in big guns. After that, uh, hearing, uh, I went to one of the most sacred places, uh, on Capitol Hill, not a church. Uh, but the members only elevator. And the reason that's sacred, it's because on the members only elevator, you can't have tourists and can't have the media in, can't have staff. And uh, and so you reach a real level of confidentiality in that cramped space. And a bunch of members piled onto this elevator after the committee meeting and one of the Republicans on this elevator said, why did you try and force us to vote for, you know, for this amendment for background checks?

Speaker 1:          02:48          And I said, well, we didn't force you to do anything. You voted against it. A, my question to you is, why would you vote against it? And this member looked at me and said, I wanted to vote for it, but I can't go home and explain that vote to my gun lobby voters. It would be the end of my career. That tells you everything you need to know about why Congress seems so paralyzed. It's just say one other thing on this. After every mass shooting, the entire country has galvanized. They want to mobilize. I mean, think about what happened after park land. You know, we, it was so certain that Congress was going to pass something. There were rallies and marches and uh, you know, everybody was talking about it. But now we're months from Parkland and what does Congress done? Nothing. I wrote this book.

Speaker 1:          03:29          So Congress people will be reminded that the solution to this is in the congress and they have to keep pressuring their members of Congress to pass meaningful reforms that will make our kids safer. I did not want to write big guns as my personal screed against the, the NRA and the gun lobby. Uh, I thought the best and most credible way of writing this book was to bring different characters in with different viewpoints. And by the way, that's what congress is like. It's different characters with different viewpoints. Uh, and I felt that the best way to tell this story a was as a satire. But you know, all set tire has to be based on a kernel of truth. And the truth in this book is that the fact that Congress does nothing, the book was actually based on a and extraordinary and a shocking event after the Sandy Hook massacre that, uh, that killed children in this elementary school in Connecticut.

Speaker 1:          04:23          I was reading a sitting, having breakfast right after that. I was so convinced that we in Congress, we're finally going to do something when first graders, uh, our gun down, it would seem that Congress would do something and my confidence was really high and I was having breakfast and I was reading my New York Times one morning and I came upon this article, uh, and I could have sworn that the New York Times had been infiltrated by the writers of the onion. Uh, because it seems so bizarre. The story was that while most state and local governments were actually passing local ordinances for gun safety, because Congress would do nothing, the small city of Nelson, Georgia decided that they would go in a different direction. This small city passed a local ordinance requiring that every resident of this city must possess a firearm. And that was my kernel of truth.

Speaker 1:          05:12          And when I saw that I said, first I had to figure out whether it was actually true. And then when I realized that it was true, I decided to build a satire round. This only instead of making it a applicable to one small city in Georgia, I federalized it. Uh, I create this law that requires that every American must own a firearm, uh, that works its way through congress. Now, if I had just written about the process, it would be a maybe a slightly lighter version of the congressional record, still very boring. And so I decided I had to weave into it real characters and I had to make sure that the characters express different viewpoints because the gun debate is in Philly is influenced by so many different viewpoints. Uh, so it was important to me that this story reflect both sides of the issue, but also make the point that Congress will not act because of the politics that surrounds us and the fear that so many of my colleagues have, uh, not that their constituents are going to be shot, uh, but that their careers may be ended if they take on the NRA and the gun lobby.
