Speaker 1:          00:05          Hey, deliberately developmental organization is first of all a mouthful. So we call it a Ddo for short. And uh, it's sort of an answer to the question. If an organization's so valued developing the capabilities of its people that would want to create a culture that could immersively gather every member of that culture into an ongoing developmental, personal kind of learning journey, what would that, uh, culture look like? What would such an organization look lark? And, uh, that's what we set out to discover and you know, in the process, uh, what we learned is that in the ordinary organization, most people are doing a second job that nobody's paying them for. That second job has to do with looking good, hiding their weaknesses, uh, covering their inadequacies, managing other people's favorable impressions of them. And you can say that's a human nature. But, uh, it also turns out to be incredibly costly in ways that we don't think enough about.

Speaker 1:          01:19          If I keep hiding my weaknesses, the likelihood that I'm going to overcome them, uh, shrinks to near zero. And, uh, the organization has to keep, essentially, I'm paying for the consequences of my limitations. And, uh, they're paying me a full time salary for part time work. So imagine an organization where people would feel safe enough that they would, uh, they would kind of consider they were hired not because anybody thought they were perfect, but because people thought they were good and that they could learn and uh, that one of their jobs there, you know, is uh, to learn and uh, where you get actually supported for, you know, revealing your mistakes. And you could say the kind of, there's kind of an entrepreneurial stance toward people development. You know, the watchword of entrepreneurial ism is not to avoid failure, but to fail frequently at to fail fast and to fail forward.

Speaker 1:          02:25          So imagine a culture where people were encouraged to do that so that they would, I keep learning and getting better. And then you would be imagining a Ddo, a deliberately developmental organization. I think another really important feature of these cultures that anyone would quickly notice if you spent a little time in them is a kind of transparency, a way in which, um, people, and often the way they'll say it is, I am who I am at work. Um, I'm, in other words, they're not living a divided life. This is what we mean by this notion that an ordinary organizations, we're all doing a second job. We're trying to look good. We're always trying to kind of be at our best, uh, in these organizations. Uh, that quickly gets seen as a way of essentially avoiding one of the most precious and valuable things that the culture has to offer you, which is the opportunity to just be the same person at work that you are when you're not at work.

Speaker 1:          03:41          And that means, you know, the good, the bad, and what you might think is the ugly. Bridgewater talks about this as a radical transparency and uh, that means that, you know, in the ordinary, ordinary organization, everybody agrees it's unprofessional to talk critically about people behind their backs and everybody participates in it. And some of you listening right now are thinking, I don't do that. Okay. You may not be a speaker, but I bet you've been a listener to such communications and you didn't say to the other person, I think it's unprofessional and wrong for you to be talking about Ralph to be behind his back. So one way or the other passively or actively, we have all participated in what we know to be unprofessional behavior in bridgewater. There is no back to be behind. Why? Uh, because hold on to your hats. In every office and in every meeting room, there's tape recording equipment and every conversation is being tape recorded.

Speaker 1:          04:55          Not in a creepy NSA a kind of way. But if I'm having a conversation, if, if you report to me and I'm having a conversation with you, I haven't had the conversation about you with my boss and you're not in the room. So I've now been talking about you. You don't have to fair through a 400 tapes and see if somebody mentioned your name. I have an obligation, send you an email and let you know you were discussed. You know, in this meeting, you know, at such and such a time on such and such a day. Feel free if you want to listen to the tape. So there's absolutely, I know it drives people, uh, you know, people get very struck, you know, by this. But, uh, you know, it's just one of a number of features that quickly give you the sense we're talking about a whole different way of being at work.

Speaker 2:          06:02          Yeah.
