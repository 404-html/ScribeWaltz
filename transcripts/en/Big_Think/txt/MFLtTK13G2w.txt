Speaker 1:          00:05          From Texas, my question is, how do you reach someone who was maybe a conspiracy theorist or someone who is a anti vaccines? I'm someone who is staunchly, scientifically, scientifically illiterate and agree with them on what a good source of facts is. Thank you.

Speaker 2:          00:31          So Daniel, how do I. How do I recommend reasoning with a conspiracy theorist? I'm right now, the last couple months I've been messing around with this idea of cognitive dissonance. This is to say you have a worldview. You're presented with evidence that conflicts with the worldview so you. You either have to change your worldview, which is hard because you've lived your whole life with it, or you just dismiss the evidence and dismissed the authorities that may have provided the evidence. The authority can be a person or it could be a book or shoot me an article in the new electric Internet computer machine to so you dismiss the evidence so that you don't have this discomfort, this conflict in your mind, this dissonance, and that's what I'm working with right now and apparently the way to overcome that is to say, we're all in this together. Let's learn about this together, present the conspiracy theorists with the idea that he or she may be rejecting evidence because it's just so uncomfortable that you're in it together.

Speaker 2:          01:33          We're in it together. I'm uncomfortable too, but when it comes to moon landings, just ask the person and how you would generate all that paperwork, the warehouses full of documentation, but national NASA created a to make landings on the moon would overwhelm any anybody trying to do it on the side. You just, it just be very difficult to print all that and just understand it's a process. Somebody who has a worldview that's inconsistent with evidence and I may have some, uh, it, it takes a while for you to turn around, like the example of palm reading or astrology. It's not something people reverse their ideas about immediately. It takes, in my experience, takes about two years for somebody to sort of look at palm reading, look at cold reading or a Tarot card reading for a while, and then realized that these Tarot card readers, palm readers, are just taking information that you've given them, the clients given them and feeding back to you.

Speaker 2:          02:31          It takes a long time in the same way people who, uh, who are anti-vaccine, I think I've just lost sight of the history. Vaccines, you know, part of the reason I'm able to be here talking with you is my grandparents did not die in 1918 during the Spanish flu when it has estimated 50 million people died twice as many peoples were killed in combat, in World War One died of this disease. If you go to old cemeteries, you can see these tombstones of very young people died of the flu. So people just lost sight of history and you can, we all tend to go, well, look at the facts, change your mind, but it takes people a couple of years to change their minds. So my recommendation, Daniel, is stick with it. You'll get frustrated. The person will get but present the idea of cognitive dissonance. This is my latest idea about a way to work together to a scientific understanding.
