Speaker 1:          00:11          One of the great things about the liver is that it regenerates, so if you cut out somebody half of someone's liver, it grows back. That's why we can now not only use cadaver livers, but we can use, we can use portions of living donors. Um, it's entirely possible that, that, um, and there's work being done in this area that in the future, a liver transplant will be no more than an injection of a number of cells that will implant somewhere in the body and will grow and form an entire new liver. So this is the whole area of stem cell transplantation. Um, and then I think the last area, um, and this is a fairly controversial area, but I think has great potential, um, and, and the background here is that as you may be aware, there are many people, particularly with liver disease, many more people that need livers than we currently have livers for.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Um, there's a whole area called xenotransplantation in which the idea is that we would take animals, pigs big, currently the preferred animal and be able to modify them genetically in such a way that a human would not only not reject a pig liver, but that any potential diseases that would be unique to a animals would not be able to be contracted by a human. This is a big, a big concern right now that, that you could envision 20 years from now, everyone who needs a liver having access to one because you would walk into, um, and I'm just as, I'm just imagine you walk into a facility, you take out a pig and you'll use the pig liver for the, for the patient or the pig pen. So I think, I think, um, I think technical advances in the, in the, uh, leading to minimally increasingly minimally invasive surgery, um, a new drugs and ultimately a sufficient understanding of the immune system that no drugs would be necessary. Um, um, the use of cells rather than whole organs. And potentially the use of animal organs are probably the four areas of the future with when it comes to to solid organ trail.
