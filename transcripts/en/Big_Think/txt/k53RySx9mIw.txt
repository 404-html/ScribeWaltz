Speaker 1:          00:11          It is argued, tend to like younger women tend to like particular figures like large hips visits that are good for childbearing and large breasts that are good for breastfeeding. Uh, and women tend to like strong, masculine, big shouldered men who can take care of their child and them. Uh, and there may be some truth to that kind of thing. I think that it's, it's, it's too neat of a system. There are lots of popular books written that way. Lots of, uh, when I teach undergraduates, they love those socio biological notions because it's just a nice, neat little system. Uh, but I think it's too neat. I think that, uh, and it varies from culture to culture at different points in our own culture. Uh, we have, uh, we've put on a pedestal more corpulent women, uh, n and D and cultures. For example, the perfect body style for a woman a is not the hourglass figure, but more of a, of a squat square figure. Uh, so it's, it's, it's too easy for us to extrapolate from cultural, current cultural norms and then say, this is some sort of evolutionary propensity. Um, there do seem to be more pairings of older, older, wealthy men and younger, uh, women, uh, which evolutionary theory would lead us to believe. But you also am always struck by a newspaper reports of older women going out with younger men. And you see more and more of that these days. And that's, that's not at all what evolution would, would have his thing.
