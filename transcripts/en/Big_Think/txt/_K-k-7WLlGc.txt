Speaker 1:          00:09          To me, there's no question that the United States, as a matter of policy, must be against torture with sign treaties to that effect. We brought people to trial internationally because we accused them of torture and some of the things the Bush administration did fall into the same category of tortures as the Japanese. We tried after World War II, the legacy of the George W dot Bush administration will be calamity, calamity for our country here in America and for the world. For those eight years. We went backwards almost the whole time. So much damage was caused to the quality of our government. Good people left the government in droves. The executive branch was politicized by people who, uh, when no, nothings do nothings and they stopped functioning and all the problems we had here and abroad just festered and got worse and got worse. What a legacy.
