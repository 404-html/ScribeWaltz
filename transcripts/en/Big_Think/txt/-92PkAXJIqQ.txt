Speaker 1:          00:09          Talking about three or four years old, I drove Walgett time, do all the time. Every second. I worked at my, when I worked at my father's flowers to it, he was at from the old country and he was a Greek immigrant law with my mother. But when I worked at, I worked at a store. I just had a good week. A shot always did. I drew all the time. And when I was in the store and I wasn't actually working, I was drawing, drawing, drawing, drawing, drawing. Yeah. It was at a high school music and art. I call it the greatest school of learning since Alexander sat at the feet of aristotle. Uh, but, uh, uh, I took design courses, you a long history of art courses along with academic courses. And I had a flat for whatever that means, but that the, at the very beginning of the design courses, they were, uh, basically, uh, you know, kind of a retro, uh, uh, you know, condensed means and Herbert and Herbert matters and the poor clays.

Speaker 1:          01:23          And we did design with circles and then we did a design with circles and triangles and circles, triangles, squares, etc. Time. And I'm aT the end of my very first term after doing that for a term, I go along with all my other courses. Uh, he, uh, uh, mr pAtterson gave us an eight to a beautiful 18 by 24 sheet of strathmore expensive sheets must have cost at least accordIng to those days, which was big bucks. And uh, he said, uh, what we're going to do it in the next hour and a half will be a one half year mark for the term, you know, we had done dozens and dozens of them and he said, um, and the subject, this time is rectangles, period. And everybody started to. And I just sat there for an hour and a half and I didn't move, just kind of looked around the room and he was furious, you know, you could see walking around with it.

Speaker 1:          02:30          Everybody visited help cutting out squares and you know, and to a shape. He had dual doing mala bitches, you know, malibu red shaped for blue chip. And I didn't move and a lady said time's up and he started to pick up english, but she was turning red and he came up to me to me any, any went that grabbed my 18 by 24 sheet and I said, hold that, met it Mr. Patterson. And I go by my name, my signature in the corner, and I handed him a 18 by 24 rectangle and he still didn't get it. He was furious and tornado. And I said, oh my god, he didn't get it. I, oh boy. and I came into the next morning and there were two or three teachers in the hallway who stopped me and they said, george, what you get for mr patterson's class was brilliant.

Speaker 1:          03:24          So he obviously had gone into the locker room, was somethIng you and as they will leave in school. And he said that george lois, he said, terrific student athletes. He to an 18 by 20. Yeah. He really did nothing. He just had to be an 18 by 24 rectangle. Anyway, that was kind of a. I've always said that was my epiphany myself and induced an epiphany when I, when I realized that, uh, and, and I made the public who relate to high school of music and art that any, that, any problem, any design problem and a communications problem, that there's a chance to do something unusual, exciting, dramatic, unique, um, and um, and I, and my whole career is based on the fact that everything I work on, what I have to create, whether it's a advertisement or, you know, a, a, a, a music video, a magazine cover, promotion piece, uh, that the, that the got to be totally surprising and unique and almost and thrilling.

Speaker 1:          04:46          I'm a social somehow in that first year at, at, at high school in Michigan on, I knew I was going to be some kind of a. I'm a commUnicator, a designer, and, and also, uh, uh, I wish really inspired me greatly by, uh, uh, the work of paul rand who at that tiMe, uh, uh, that was 45 and I was 14 years old and he must've been like 26 or something. He was wanting to king. Uh, and he, uh, was, he was a writing and creating his own advertising for People for, for uh, uh, clients like all backs and he was doing an ibm logos, et cetera. And um, he was turning to look at his work. not that my work is anything near what his is, but, um, I, uh, I was thrilled with the idea that a, a, that you could work in a, as a communicator, as a designer, as an advertising guy and uh, and, and create your own work and not be a whore and not, and not do a, you have awful, terrible work. so that, that.

Speaker 1:          06:04          Well, I started in advertising. I after highschool and music and art, uh, that was, that was basically my, uh, my graphic arts training as far as I'm concerned. They was in for incredible years. uh, I then went to a it to it and I, uh, and it, uh, I met my future wife that first day of school and I was nuts about it. And um, I realized they have to want it to after a weekend of attracted, they weren't anywhere near as good as the high school music and art. But I stuck it out because I went, I went into buy the lever and um, I went to the first year and then the second year I, I, you know, I didn't cry. I didn't quite know what to do when I can, because I know the school was so awful. And um, but I want to buy first clashes.

Speaker 1:          06:50          At the second year they had a, again, I ran into another great mentor, a male teacher, but marsha levitt and he looked at me and he was, he showed what I did for him and he said, george, yes, and why in school and I should, I'm trying to make a living, you know, and he shed, get out of, you're not going to learn any more here. And he gave me a pivot of piece of paper with a woman's name who had had a woman art director, which are very unique back then who had an art studio. And she sent me to him the next night. The next morning I and I left school in Michigan in before my, actually my first seven years started. I'm a show and achieved good promotion and advertising, etc. It was a great, great first job because she would have a superbug designer.

Speaker 1:          07:37          It shows what happened was I lost my exemption for the army. It was during the korean war and I got drafted and a lot of going to Korea came back alive. And um, uh, she wanted me to be a partner with her but I didn't want to. And she said, what do you want to do? I really want to work at cbs television because there was a really dynamic time with her incorporate imagery and corporate design with the great bill golden that, the head of it. Okay. Just if they had just done the cbhi. So I went into, at cbs and it was a, I tell you, hey, of design and advertising, but somehow it wasn't a big, it wasn't big time advertising to go with, uh, you know, we worked on products, etc. And from then, so I left there, you know, and, and bill golden a shed to me in [inaudible] 53 or four, whatever it was, 54.

Speaker 1:          08:35          Uh, george, you can't go out there. It's a world that the world is terrible. They will feel exchange. They will hatch. And he was right, you know, um, he said, you not going to be happy, they're not going to appreciate your talented and I should. Well, I, I, somehow something drove me to, to do it and uh, you know, I, I went and I went and I had that I had the job I went to was pretty awful. And I ended a lot of, a lot of stories, a seemingly are apocryphal, but actually true when I kind of acted up in my first agency, can overturned the desk at shadows, did some kind of crazy stuff that, uh, after that I, uh, I went and I worked with somebody great. The other greAt pioneers in advertising in and in an inadvertent designer. Her blue bow and I worked there.

Speaker 1:          09:30          Then I went to the door, then brought back and work with them for bill burn back into and bob gauge and, and um, and so and, and again, I guess something insane, uh, uh, I left doyle dane to a bar back and I told him I was leaving to start the second creative agency and work with bill back and started the only creative agency where the reason I started it, it was based on the fact that he had worked with paul rand early in his career and somehow he understood that for your work, but good to have a graphic designer, especially a one who is prolific and could write like poetry in that you could do better advertising if you worked, if, if the, if there are automatic, the could work, could conceive advertising with the writer, which up to that time basically all advertising was a attractor.

Speaker 1:          10:23          Sat in a room with his stomach was and waited for the creative director for the, for the copywriter come in. So I'm a piece of paper and say, make a layout yet later shout and the layout, you know, the typical awful, you know, unambitious layout. So I left oil. Dan brought back when I left orlando brown back, bill bernbach said to me, george, you don't know what's out there. Uh, you know, uh, uh, uh, the uh, uh, you know, they, they, they, and he, and he literally shut that door they brought back, which was basically a creative freak. They, that they come, how they were miraculous. A group of people as somehow together could forge a great advertising and it couldn't happen again. Uh, not in, not in this philistine world, but I started the agency called pepper kang. Lois was that west to writers actually.

Speaker 1:          11:21          And um, and we were successful almost immediately, almost immediately. And, and then after a couple of few ca, one, two to three years coming out of all my say what to other agencies, uh, you know, uh, you know, call allie and slos. And then another guy left my agency and started going into business with Mary Wells and started married, know well, which green and before you knew it by the mitch by the mid sixties, uh, uh, you know, I realized that I had triggered with starting not second, the creative agency. I had triggered something call the creative evolution in advertising and um, and uh, and, and it, it, it became the, uh, the uh, golden age of, uh, of, of, of advertising in the sixties and seventies basically was a golden age of advertising and advertising.

Speaker 1:          12:24          This been, uh, you know, uh, think I hate the show, which is true. Um, you know, when I first started the show well before to me that I got a call from one of the producers and he said, you know, we're looking at where we're shooting. We're doing little spots with the people who were the original mad men. He said, of the period ending I was shooting. And then they'd named for five or six people and I'd never heard of a couple of them. and I'm a andw , w, w, wherever, whoever we talked to. But matches your name. I said, time out. You're doing a show on the advertising section. You'd never heard my name. He had on order. We've heard out of bullshit. You never heard my name as well. Uh, okay. I said, if you want to know what happened in the sixties, if you wanted a real understanding what happened at 60.

Speaker 1:          13:16          I did a book in 1972 called george. Be careful, which is basically a, you know, my story about, uh, you know, uh, going up in New York and growing up in the New York school of design, I became what it is one to in New York shoulder and how I started, you know, uh, the creative agency world and how that became the but, but, but it's all about the center. And um, and I call the george be careful because when I was a kid, uh, you know, I remember the hand of god coming into my, into my bedroom. We'll michelangelo's hand said good george, be careful. And my mother's, my mother told me, Georgia all my life. My mother told me, my father, my sisters and my coaches and sports. My, uh, uh, my, uh, when I went into the army and I told him to be careful and then again, when you go into advertising, so that's when everybody tells you to be careful, you know, anything, anything unusual, anything over the top, anything edgy, you can't do that.

Speaker 1:          14:22          So if there would george be careful with my anti slow anti slogan and if you want to know anything about the advertising in the sixties and the appetite, he read that book goodbye. You know, and I, you know, I wish I could fuck you. And I called it and he called me back a couple of days later. I told him to go get the book on amazon because it was out of her. He called me up a couple of days later. They say, oh jesus, wow. We could have done a show on that. I didn't know shit, you know, because of course that would think the sixties. Anybody who knows anything, the media world and anything know anything about it. When you mentioned the sixties and you mentioned advertising in the sixties, they don't think now they think of the madman, of that thumb show before that they thought of it as a lower gauge of really, uh, uh, of the eight that I was talking to you about, about drinking or you know, when you're leaving doyle dane bernbach and doe and burbank with a giant part of it obviously. And then with the other three or four agency after that came out of my agency that was the most a roll cage in media communications since the year 10 to 12 of the 12 apostles.

Speaker 1:          15:38          Well, um, just to oversimplify, the big idea is to, is the, uh, is the, is the, is, is a concept that, that, that takes the unique selling, the unique virtues of a product and, and shaping it into somebody's into people's minds a that somehow forces a, a, a, a extraordinary sales increase in whatever you're talking about. Uh, but, you know, and I always talk about the big idea. I'm kind of call the best of mr. Big idea. Um, you know, but what I'm really talking about is, uh, is to creativity and I, and I say creativity can shovel almost any problem, you know, the, uh, you know, the creative act, there's free of habit by originality can overcome everything. But at the same time that I talk about the creative act, I really, I really tell people who are, who are trying to be to create a work that creativity isn't really a creative active back to discovery.

Speaker 1:          16:52          And they look at you like her, you know. Um, and I, I did a book called, um, george on his creation of the big idea, you know, where I show 100 things. I did on the right hand patient on the left hand page before I show something in my dna. Something in my understanding of, of a shutdown in years of, of, of, of, uh, something of my understanding of, uh, of, of movies, of ballet, of a sports show, but have a fumo of dirty jokes. Whenever it is something in there that inspired what I did. And I tell, I tell the young people especially, um, you know, uh, uh, that, that background that, uh, that, uh, of, of high art and pop art at an intellectual background of understanding the world around you when, uh, and uh, and, and, and, and especially, uh, you know, the 7,000 years of art is, is, is, uh, is, is essential to doing creative work that, some of that and that one, once you have that, that understanding, you know, and, and that, that ssl of, of, of, of, of trying to understand everything when you have any kind of a problem, if you then look at the problem and look at the competitor and etc, then look at it and get your basic information.

Speaker 1:          18:17          Once you really understand the problem, the answer is the answer was there. It's like floating by, you know, you got to do is grab it. It really isn't an act of creativity from active discovery. I sound very mystical talking about it, but I absolutely, that's absolutely what creativity is to me. I fight, learn all there is to learn about something and I know I'm ready to, to, to come up with an answer. It's there and it's not a bolt of lightening what it is, it's coming out of your own, uh, out of your own essential belief in own understanding of the world.

Speaker 1:          19:01          The method is, uh, is to be interested in everything. And the, and the organic part of it is the passion for, for everything around you. The passion for, you know, I mean, I know when I, when I teach a class, you know, at school of visual arts as a favor to somebody and I'll, I'll stay till clashes, get 25 kids, uh, once the, uh, uh, one, the, if any, have been to the museum of metropolitan museum of art did here. Okay. Have you ever been to the moment this year? One hand? Uh, and if had anybody have any of you never been to a museum but not, not, you know, five people, eight people, you know, I must style. Did you know, I'm just truly astounded, you know, talking to design students, people who were supposed to be communicated, you know, you don't know, you know, that total.

Speaker 1:          20:03          And that's why when people say today, wednesday, the second agent, the second a credible solution to know, I said, I mean, you got, you got the, he got the internet and you've got google, we got all the information at your fingertips to know and nobody they don't know shit. Nobody knows shit. You know, one of the classic books and advertising, one of the great books and advertising the confessions of an ad man. Uh, you know, by, uh, by uh, uh, david ogleby, every word in there is the wrong absolutely wrong. We want in. When I was working at doyle dane bernbach in 1959, I got conned by his copy chief into coming to see ogilvy and I said, I should do. You're talking to the wrong guy. Yeah, I mean, uh, uh, and they. And he begged me to come and I went and uh, ogilvy's trying to hire me as their head art director.

Speaker 1:          21:07          You know, I think at one point I said I need to head off to act different if I could become the they creative creative chief. He was the creative chief, creative chief. I could, I could do great arbit sizing. Yeah. Yeah. But, and I told him, I said, mr olubayi, I don't know why you're trying to hire me because I don't understand one word. It, I don't believe I don't, I don't agree with one word in your book. I mean he had, you know, here's the rules of addition to the logo. It's got to be here. And he's got me. He's got rules. There are no rules and advertise. It's impossible. You know, I mean, the only rule in advertising, if there are no rules, you know, the best of what shanti and our look at the new standard, you know, I mean it's a company of a, of a, of a famous people have people want to be famous with blurbs all around it and supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          22:08          And uh, you know, just fuck that. Supposed to be creativity in journalism. My god, it's unbelievable. It's shocking. I mean, how can, how can 200 magazines, you know, do the same cover, you know, that's always there and advertise to go home and watch advertise. I watch avatar commercials on tv and I don't really, I, I'm not kidding. I don't really, I don't really understand what, what the hell. I mean half of them, I don't understand what they're talking about. Yeah. And, and most people don't understand, even if they see something that they kind of enjoy, they don't remember the name of the product, you know? So I mean, I think, uh, I don't, I don't see any, I mean these people to keep talking about, we're on the advent of coming up with the creative evolution. I don't see it. You know, I don't. At the same time, I know there's got to be content that they, I don't, I'm not sure who's telling them what to do.

Speaker 1:          23:05          Yeah. You have to have an understanding. You have to understand, have an that everything that I got back to what I said before, everything you do, you have to have a shower from. If you come up with an idea, a big idea it, if you, if you show it to somebody, your wife, your friend or a client, they should go holy shit. They shave your head coach and go back and forth, you know, it should be such to be such and such a surprising idea. The only chance you have to do anything unless you remember bullshit. It has to be a shock when you first see it, you know, and what people do is they, they, they, they just. So the, so the work is so unAmbitious, you know, uh, I mean television commercials are little films, you know, something's going on and you don't know what's going on and you say, well, what is it about?

Speaker 1:          23:56          And then you're looking for who the client is. And then when you see it, you say, oh, I don't get it. You know, um, shot that night trying to, to. It's a wasteland of creativity unfortunately. And I can't believe they didn't talent that day because I know I pay people. I have fans profess, you know, a love of my work at set of a set of standard kind of be something you gotta learn from it. I went and got to be learning from it is that when you do something, it should be, it should be a knock out, an idea, you know, and, and in most cases, certainly in the, certainly in an editorial and in which I already did for 10 years for esquire and I and I, you know, and then now in the museum or not, but, but, uh, but you have to, you know, when you're, every cover is when it hit, when it was on a newsstand, peep some people. WhAt I mean, the, the culture went ape shit on to, on some of them. They looked at It like, whoa, um, um, you know, go to a new standard today. There's not a metal boat. Forget about something being culturally, being a culture busta. There's nothing there that you could possibly remember. There's an lead today in about her that today, but with three magazines I talk about, they're getting awards, etc. Etc. And you look at the covers and uh, uh, I don't know nothing, you know, they're all the same cover, you know.

Speaker 1:          25:30          No, that's the, that's the big problem, you know, I mean, I'm talking about people or about a young design is not, not being ambitious enough, etc. Etc. One of the problems is, is that, uh, you know, certainly in, in magazine design, there's a lot of terrific talent, uh, doing editorial. I mean, when you get this society publication designer sends via, there were awards every year, a book, you know, and uh, and you look through it. And if I've terrific spreads in it, a lot of exciting stuff going on, you know, there's talent there and then they showed the best coverage of the year and at they are nothing, you know, everything who was the editor, uh, you know, Carolyn Hayes came to me. He had just basically taken over the ship of their magazine even though he had been responsible for the last five or six or seven issues.

Speaker 1:          26:23          And uh, he, he had, he had been leading in 1960 in 1962 about, uh, my, uh, my ad agency. And they, and the reason he, it struck them was because it was an art director with the first ad agency publication lowish, where there was an art director in the, in, in a, in a masthead. And the stories were all my advertising, you know, every month there was a big story in the New York times, at least about campaigns I had done. So he was looking at the avid art directors are exciting work and something made him call me, uh, to get advice on how to do coverage. I'd never done a cover in my life. and, and when he called me, I what I saw him, I didn't, I didn't know. I thought he was trying to get advertising for our ad agency and I was being nice to talk to them because I had been reading a magazine and it was a terrific magazine.

Speaker 1:          27:13          And he and he basically said, I need advice, how do you. And I said, well, how do you do them now? How do you do your covers now? He said, well, you know, a five, you know, four or five or saturday and sit down with, for their three or four feet out in november, we have a long discussion about, and we try to come up with the, uh, the, the, uh, what topic and the issue of coming up should be the subject of a color. I said, yeah. And then he said, and that we owe to go away. We come back two, three days later, we, each of us, uh, have one or two ideas on what the cover should be and maybe it's five or six of them that we really don't quite know. So we pick them out, we comp them up. And I said, oh my god, goop, fucking grope.

Speaker 1:          27:56          And he said, huh? I said, group grope. I said that you have to, when you're work with a male and police and, and, uh, you know, and I said, no, of course not. I said, well, obviously you don't have anybody there who knows how to somebody younger constitutionally, howard, why don't we do this? So go out. And basically I was saying get a freelancer. So he said, well, how do you. I said, well, you know, uh, you got to get somebody who understands the culture, who's kind of added a culture, who, uh, who's literate, uh, who, who understands, who loves politics, who loves to, you know, who likes, loves the opera theater, music, and uh, and uh, and, and, uh, you know, when you tell a dirty joke and he know spark somebody understands the culture and, and I, and I shot to give them a couple of names that make with people might be able to do it. And he said he was, he was southern southern liberal, kind of an oxymoron. And he said, hey pal, can you do me one favor? I don't know what the hell you're talking about. Can you do me one cover and the one cover? Uh, and uh, I said, once you get a bunch of next day she would do, went to the next cover, do. And he said, next tuesday, but now let me give you time. I said, I'll do it for next tuesday. What's an issue?

Speaker 1:          29:25          I don't have it here. I said, describe it to tell it, to scan a sentence for each story. So told me this, this, this, this, and one of the things he mentioned was, um, uh, a spread with a photo and a short piece on floyd patterson, who was a champion of the world. And sonny liston was the challenger and floyd was in the upcoming fight with a big favorite big five to one favorite too fast for listing the shadow shadow. Um, and I said, well, surely issues that have come out, uh, the issue will come out a week before the fight. I said, okay. I went away and I did a cover. I got a guy who looked like a, like, like patterson, you know, six foot, not too muscly. And I showed him and a call the fight. I basically shut. Everybody was wrong about it and he's not gonna win the fight and he's going to get, you're going to get destroyed by linkedin.

Speaker 1:          30:23          And I show parish and laying flat, you know, in the middle of the ring, left for dead. You know, nobody, nobody in the arena, the, the, his handlers are gone. The pressure's gone, 20,000 people are gone and it was a metaphor for a metaphor, not only for sports but boxing, you know, you lose your, if you're losing it, you're dead, you know, and uh, but a metaphor for any walk of life, you know, when you're lucia, they leave me for dead. I'm anyway. And I and I and, and the cover and w when he shut, he called me up and he showed my god I never saw a couple of my life. And I said, yeah, right. HE said, but you're calling the fighting. No shit, you're crazy. Supposedly long. I said 50 slash 50 chance to right know. And if I'm right, you're a genius and if a long time you know, hey, you know, you played the game but I had on blight, you know, I've been told that I am absolutely right.

Speaker 1:          31:32          And anyway, he, I found out many years later he ran because he said he would quit if he, if a publisher turned it down, which in fact when the issue came out, the publisher on king rich wrote a editorial saying, you cover, she our cover. We have nothing to do with it, you know, and it's absolutely true. Anyway, when the cover came out, when, when the issue came out, the, uh, every, it was a laughing stock in the sports world and they hold the young five or six days later listening, destroyed them and they were junior ship landed the biggest douche standard sales history. And found out later there were guys, uh, the that I've met only a couple of years ago. They said when I, when the cover came out, they thought it was. She ended up esquire because they didn't almost unexpected paycheck. Anyway. They were so deeply and read the magazine.

Speaker 1:          32:35          I found out later that they were really in trouble naturally. And what happened from the time I started doing a coverage to for almost 10 years is to show the circulation went from 500,000 to 2 million and uh, you know, and, and, and w with cover after cover, uh, you know, some incredibly controversial, uh, but you know, any math, the only mash magazine in America that, that dad speak out against the Vietnam war. And in fact, we, we, we, we were tHe leading, uh, we were the leading people in the media, in, in, in America against the Vietnam war. And, uh, and in the support of muhammad ali, which I would've hated to a fighter at the time of, uh, after it became a muslim and a and a, and refused to fight in, in that terrible war, you know, so, uM, uh, and, and, and it only happened because of page because people say, boy, he took trump boss covers when I was in boston, the recovered it took him boss to run it, you know.

Speaker 1:          33:46          And in fact, you know, uh, you know, I said I'd call them up and I'd say a watch. I was sending a cover that one. And I, and I always chose my own shop, a topic for what he showed me. Sometimes he show, he talked about the, uh, what was coming up with a magazine. And I, and I knew the topic that he was basically excited about with the one I had to do because it was that important. But in many times I, I picked the, you know, like that cover I did, like I told you about for the first issue with listed, whether it was just the spread that they put it in at the last Minute, you know, but, uh, uh, but I, I call him up and I say, I said I about the get the high world and uh, and I said this one's going to read and get us in trouble and didn't say, yeah, you know, and when I'm in trouble, I meant a, he would lose, not only would it be get bombed to his bike saturdays and congressmen and god knows who and, and, and, and.

Speaker 1:          34:45          Right. And people writing in your death threats sometimes, you know, losing a advertising client because he had, they had many clients down southville where they get a lot of uh, uh, you know, men's wear and a lot of mills went down south and, and, and there was a time of the jim crow south. I mean, it was a time of real racism going on in America with dick. I wish racism in America, but that, which one? It was a rabbit and ramping, no, it's changing for worse because I'm, um, somehow, you know, growing up with the internet and growing up on the stuff on the screen and filling it, filling the page with information, look at, look at motion magazines, state, look at even the great magazines today, you know, and like a vanity fair. It's just jammed with and New York that, that is just jammed with information and copy of cetera.

Speaker 1:          35:51          It's almost like it's an extension of, of the tb, of the, of what people were used to. I mean, when you're talking about white space in which we used to be a big thing in, in, in, in school, in graphic art school in god. Yet we've tAlked about hate that white space. But they knew what they were talking about. They were talking about she, which sometimes wait, that's an idea that should, that so that you need the expansIon you need to know. And you know, the great pioneers in advertise in editorial design in, in the twenties and thirties was a guy named dr argo and alexey brodovitch for vogue magazine. And, um, and uh, you know, the, the irving penn's and avid dons and all graphic design learn somehow from that kind of experience of the, of, of, uh, of, uh, of a spread that had some kind of vitality to it.

Speaker 1:          36:49          And um, and uh, when you look at the internet, there's a load of information, but there's no, they're not designed right calorie and then no attempt for design, vitality. I mean even most people's websites where you have a chance to, to do something, to express something and it's not so much, you know, I'm not down on the ipad or whatever they do, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm for the magazine. I fought a visual, a excitement of magazine. I mean, to this day, yeah, when I get magazines and they don't have to be even be a great magazine, you know, you turn the page read, you know, you know, when you lay it on your, when you lay it on your knees, that's like a lap dance. You know, I mean, it's a official thing, you know, and I can't see, you know, uh, you know, I mean if I was a really young, a young man today, a good to shape, what would, what would you do?

Speaker 1:          37:55          The website we do and I'd be, I'd created a magazine. Yeah. I create a magazine, have people say, holy shit. Did you see that cover? Then open, like, wow, we should do it. It's the, it's the, it's the, it's, it's a, it's a revolution in journalism, you know, the, the, a graphic dEsigner, you know, who, who understands them ideas and understands that I, that I did what their make that makes world go around, could change the world with a magazine. If it did one talent could do it right now. And everybody was stopped at the magazines.

Speaker 1:          38:33          I've tried, I've tried it. It's funny because some people said, well, you know, have you ever thought about cheyenne had been, you want a movie director or this, of that? And I said, yeah, well when I've able to beat it to be, to work on and being a graphic designer and being an advertising, etc. It was, I, I, I, I, I, I've done hundreds, thousands of commercials, you know, music, video, music, video ever done to this day joke. I'm in cocoa loaded still sessions, the best music video ever. Uh, you know, I thought that the shells, films that would knock it down, it was so exciting. Uh, you know, I do, I design logo design packages, you know, uh, uh, I, I, I designed an agency or a design space, you know, uh, you know, I mean every part of, um, uh, you know, uh, I could, I could be a renaissance man in a sense doing all of those things.

Speaker 1:          39:41          And um, uh, including, um, uh, I, the, the, the concept for New York magazine and actually the first design for the first logo for New York magazine I did as a supplement for the herald tribune in 1962 or three. Um, and in fact it was at my office one day, I think it was 63, it might've been 62. And, uh, he showed me working at a magazine and he said, well, what he, he took, what are you doing? I didn't want to, I'm, I'm doing the, I do the advertising for the New York herald tribune and he knew that because I was doing a very excited to paint who, uh, who says a newspaper has to be taught, in fact, that was producing a commercial for the tribune every night, get the front page and, and write a write a script and the shooting script in a cab and produce a commercial every night.

Speaker 1:          40:41          They would go on every night again, in any case. And I, and I, it was a big success and I said, well, I see the selling the hell out of the newspaper. Uh, danny paper, the sunday paper, I can't do anything with it. Could, you can't compete with the ties or they're sticking it in a show. I've been doing a supplement of trying to get them to understand that they can do a supplement called New York. And if you did it right, you do a beautifully designed to get terrific writing, etc cetera. And it could be a combination of the, of, uh, I said of the, of the new yorker andq magazine, you're telling you about specific things to do, uh, and if you did that, you know, you can sell another 200, 300,000, 400,000 copies just because a terrific supplement. And uh, and lookIng at it, and this was, I've only been doing covers for them for half a year or so.

Speaker 1:          41:38          And he said, george, if you, if I left esquire right now and you left your agency, we should do this magazine and we should do bag of scenes because it's a city magazine. And he said, and we could do a city magazine for seven or eight bucks, here's a card preppy. And I remember it was second saying, holy shit, that's a real big idea. That's big thing. And I've got hiM to do it. But I had an ad agency and he and he was doing. But when you say why didn't, why didn't I do it now? I said, well, you know, it's not that I'm old and tired because we actually don't. I suPposedly retired in to the year 2000 and my wife says, I'm not tired, I'm just, I'm not retired, I'm just tired, but I'm not because I work all the time. I worked with my A look and we do stuff all the tIme with doing advertising. Yeah, we're working on a script and shooting script for a tv special, a set, et cetera, et cetera. but, uh, you know, you have a hotel. I might do a magazine.

Speaker 1:          42:49          I would have to do work with a, a, a direct, a, uh, an editor who basically treated me the way howard and treated me as a, as a big talent. Uh, he took me at least as good as he treats. He treated the gates, elise, you know, and that's what he did with me. He said, you know, your ideal, your ideal with the releases and the, and the male is the initiative and the lowest isn't. And they do that thing. That doesn't mean he didn't edit those guys, you know, and which he absolutely did, you know, because even a great writer leach editing. Um, but, uh, uh, he didn't edit it. He didn't edit or change one thing on anything. I have a dead. I mean, would I dished up? And he was like, holy shit, wow, you know, I love it, you know, or a wow, am I going to be in trouble here?

Speaker 1:          43:48          You know? And uh, and of course he loved the whole concept of beIng in trouble because being in trouble meant, uh, meant that people, that he knew, that he knew, that he knew that a magazine had I had to be dynamic and how to have the ideas. And he also understood something that people know it as the worst understands today. And that is, you don't write, you don't write, you don't create a magazine for your, you don't do a pickup, you don't take a poll, you know, like, yeah, like the politician don't find out what, what they think and what they want. What do you mean, what they want? What do you mean? What they want? They're supposed to be above and beyond that, you know, uh, the culture you're supposed to be leading the culture. She to be ahead because he's supposed to be telling people what the hell you think is exciting and dynamic and, and, and, and, uh, and, and, and, and thought provoking and, and do it and do it your way.

Speaker 1:          44:48          And that's the way you could create a great margaret. And then if you do it to see if you do it that way with all that kind of passion and a talent, you'll get an audience. You know, we got all audience, our patient with a at esquire 60, the audience basically. I'm not sure. I never find out what the real numbers were, but I think at a trauma, a, a half of the circulation. I'm making it up a college with college students. Yeah. I run into people all the time. I finish a day who, uh, you know, who were in their twenties when I was doing coverage in the sixties, you know, and uh, and now nowadays 60, a 60 years old and a boy, they know every cover they taught. They can tell you how the coverage changed their law, that changed their lives.

Speaker 1:          45:35          They can tell you, they can tell. The people tell me where they were when they show the ali cover. I think sebastian, they can tell. They tell me when, when, where they were, when they sort of cover that. That's the kind of, uh, of uh, you know, and I will call them a pictorial zola's. You know, what's funny is I said toilet zola's to somebody a couple of months ago when they said what to pick zola door. Um, you know, wHat I explained to jack huge. They still didn't get it, but any case, you know, and, and I, and I call myself a, a cultural provocateur and I call myself a cultural product toward my advertising pto because when you create adverTising, it's not just to sell a product or a person or an idea it, it should go beyond that. It should, it cAn touch sometimes very dynamIcally on the, on the culture and it there's no way you can't do great advertising mess.

Speaker 1:          46:37          You understand that it shouldn't, you shouldn't just be selling a product you shouldn't be talking about in the culture or where the culture should be headed. P, I talked to that, but I took, I tell students that the young people and young people in advertising that they don't know what the fuck I'm talking about it. They don't Get it until I show examples. You know what? So when you say what excites me most, an appetite he was on, I took something and made and made it into a giant part of the culture. Um, uh, and, uh, that's, that was the most thrilling, you know, uh, of the things that I worked on and I've done a couple of doesn't like that. Um, the, the, the, the, the esquire covers. What I was most excited about was, um, the antiwar stuff, you know, stuff that woke up and help walk, wake up America and, and uh, and uh, and uh, and, and woke up people to the, to the greatness of muhammad ali because when I did that cover of a hammer to leave st bastian, he was, he was, he was.

Speaker 1:          47:59          I mean, if there was a poll on it that 80 percent of the country, white and black were against him. And, um, and the, that cover enough of a shelf help change the american attitude about the war and directly directly helped change martin luther king from shane to all of the sudden the, uh, all, all his older black leaders that he would keep out of talking to or against the Vietnam war because she didn't want to piss off a johnson because johnson was a, was a pioneer in, in helping, uh, in, in, in helping, uh, you know, you're fortunate, you know, what civil rights laws, uh, what, uh, the check and he came out against it defending muhammad ali and against the war. Uh, he wAsn't deep shIt with the johnson. Uh, so I mean, uh, I think, uh, a of a lot of things I've done that helped change the culture, you know, I mean, that's the stuff that you really remember.

Speaker 1:          49:17          I mean, uh, yeah, I, I stayed, I would do a magazine. You know what? I probably would start an ad agency and show everybody how much done, you know, uh, you know, additionally, there was an article I read day. I, what's funny is you're, you're, you read 30 magazines, you can't remember where you read it, you know, in the old days if esquire, what? Esquire, what am I covered? Do you remember where you show up? But that's beside the point. Uh, but uh, uh, it was an article, got the head of the largest agency in a world publish ashish. I guess Joe Levy ain't go with questions and answer. It goes on and on and on. He talks about his technology. I mean, if he had not one fucking word talking about his ad age that mentioned creativity, it's like, it's like a, like it's got nothing to do.

Speaker 1:          50:15          The product got nothing to do with what they do, what they know about it. It's shocking, you know? Uh, that's the way it used to be with all the ada. Does she have. I remember they would agency, like ogilvy made it, you know, after david ogilvy, he died and they, and they would, they talked about and the jewish, I, they, they sold themselves on the fact that there were scientific agency and a sense that they did this great research, you know, and the little, and I told everybody, you know, advertising isn't a science, it's an art. Tell me shy. Um, and, and, and your most, at most, the most advertised, most people in the day, most people in the who judge advertising in a, in a, in, in, in, in the world, uh, in certainly in America. They've all got their marketing schools and communication schools and when they, and they been taught or that advertising and marketing is a science because how do you teach it for the art?

Speaker 1:          51:21          You know, I mean, what would the school say for advertising and marketing know why I didn't teach that, you know? Um, so, um, so to this day, the way you show a client, most clients or something and understand something really edgy and uh, and they'll look at it and they'll say, very interesting. I'll hand it to somebody who's sitting next to him with a senior vp and say to a very interesting research it and find out, find out if I like it, you know, um, you know, there's, there's not, there's no people that are talking about the creativity of something, you know, uh, uh, it's astounding in all walks of life, you know, I mean starting with the head of one of those giant ad agencies go. But I was totally by elgar. He made it and I remember the woman was the head of the agency.

Speaker 1:          52:14          She went on and on and on and on and on about that because the, uh, the way they research, et etc cetera, and it's about time were, were, were, were, were, were, were not. One mention of creativity. I mean, and, and, and people like bill bird back when he did doyle, dane bernbach or people like me with papa kate, lois and Mary Wells, wells rich greene, you know, that, that's all we talked about was creativity. What the fuck else is there to talk about? That's the name of the game, mr. Product, you know, it's when you, when you talk to a guy who, uh, to, to malali at the ford, he talks about the car, but the product, you know.
