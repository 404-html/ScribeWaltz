Speaker 1:          00:00          What's an event? It's a difficult question. Not because we lack definitions, but because there are too many definitions. In my book, I focus on event in the sense of something extraordinary takes place. But with all this, uh, a wide span of what we call an event, I think an elementary structure can be described in formal terms within a certain field of phenomena where things go on the normal flow of things from time to time something happens, which as it were retroactively changes the rules of what is possible in the sense that something happens, it is generated by that situation. Of course, it's causally produced by that situation back in a way, it changes retroactively the whole situation. It's a miracle in the sense of the event would have been an aspect which is stronger than its own causes. For example. Now come a couple of examples that I hope we will all like in literature.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Why is Kafka Franz Kafka the one that we all know and love and event? Of course she has predecessors. We can say that Kafka implicitly or explicitly relied on a whole series of other artists like Edgar Allen Poe, the story of Ski Visium, Blake and so on. But it's not a simple as that because when you try to isolate in those earlier authors what makes them predecessors of Kafka, you can see that that dimension Kafka before Cafca is perceptive and only one staff that is already here as a bar has the Argentinian writer as he put it in a wonderful, concise way. Truly, Eh, all authors, writers have predecessors, a truly great writer in a way creates his own past his own predecessors so that uh, yes there are people who influenced him, but you can see this influence only once he is here. And now let me jump to a totally different domains.

Speaker 1:          02:37          Love, love in the good old fashion sense, which is today more and more rare love as an encounter. This is why in English and also in some other language is not all like French. You use the term fall, we fall in love. This is the eventful dimension in what sense? Let's say you live a happy life. You are lucky. You have a job, you meet regularly with French, you are not in love, but you just make one night's 10th maybe here and there. You meet every evening with friends you drink, you go to blah, blah. Then all of a sudden in a totally contingent way, let's say you stumbled on the streets, somebody helps you to stand up. It's a young girl or a boy, blah blah. And of course it's the love of your life. It totally contingent encounter, but the result can be that your whole life changes.

Speaker 1:          03:39          Nothing is the same as they say. You even spontaneously perceive your entire past life is leading towards this unique moment. You know, the illusion of love is, oh my God, I was waiting all my life for you. This something like this would have been the love event. And I think it's getting more and more rare today. Many intelligent cultural critics. Notice how we are almost returning to pre romantic premodern times when marriage or love connections were a matter of uh, uh, relatives, counselors and so on. Your uncle, your own day selected whom you will marry and so on. Today, it's similar only instead of all those old twice uncles and so on, it's dating agencies, marriage agencies, and shown and so on. What we bought, they offer us is precisely love without the fall, without falling in love, without this totally unpredictable promatic encounter. And that's what I find very sad.

Speaker 1:          04:54          I think that today we are simply more and more afraid of this eventful. It counters you encounter something which is totally contingent, but the result of it, if you accept it as an event, is that your entire life changes. It's a different story. Uh, this is why I think that this avoiding falling in love is the same phenomenon as a standard joke that I use in my all my, uh, almost all my books. You know how we want to date the thing without the bad aspect of it, without the price, we have to pay for it. We won't, I don't know. Uh, we want, uh, sugar without calories. So we have sweeteners. We want to be or without alcohol, we want and so on and so on. And I claim it's the same thing in sexuality. We want brief, safe sex, sexual without the fall, without this fake to attachment. And I think this is the most set theme here, the Tivan what is slowly emerging as maybe deeper dominant ideology. Today, what I ironically referred to us, western Buddhism life is just a playoff appearances. Don't take it too seriously. Maintain appropriate. These styles don't get too attached to where Lee objects. It's fits perfectly, this superficial consumerist attitude. So again, events are rare. An event is the traumatic encounters, which to put it in more learn philosophical terms retroactively creates its own costs.
