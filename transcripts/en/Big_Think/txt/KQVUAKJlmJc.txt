Speaker 1:          00:07          Well if I open my refrigerator I'm going to pay. I'm going to hell you and I'm going to get into Charlotte. Probably two or three type of either vegetable or salad or zucchini. I always have plenty in my refrigerator along with the beer and and the milk and probably some cream as well. So those are angry at the end that are in the refrigerator and in the pantry. I have a fair amount of canned and from canned tuna. But again there are quality. You can have extraordinary tuna in cans from pot to get off somewhere else. I had no long ago with some apricot in from Morocco. They were just fantastic. You know and so again all beans. I mean different type of beans. There is nothing wrong with can beans be good if I could beans. I will take beans water and salt and Velveeta. That's what I'm going to have in that can. There is nothing foreign in that camp that I wouldn't want to have in terms of chemical products or whatever. Liquid. Or. TO. MAKE IT. IT'S.
