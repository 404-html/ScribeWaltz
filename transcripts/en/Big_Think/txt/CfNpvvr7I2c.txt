Speaker 1:          00:06          We all experience emotionally charged conflicts, whether it's in the workplace with a colleague, whether it's at home with a spouse, whether it's even in our country, dealing with political issues, the challenges, how do we deal with them most effectively. Now, my sense is that most people come in with like the quick fix answer, uh, the rational approaches just listen a little bit more, talk a little bit less, and that's useful, but that's not enough. Beneath rationality is this other layer to the conflict, which is the emotional layer. You're starting to get angry. You're colleague is starting to get angry and things start to fester, but even that is not the fundamental force driving us in conflict. What's the core? It's identity. At the end of the day, what tends to fuel our emotions in a conflict is a threat. Who we are and what we stand for, and the moment I threaten what you deeply care about, all of a sudden now we have a real emotionally charged conflict.

Speaker 1:          01:07          So the moment your identity feels threatened, all of a sudden you fall prey to a very dangerous mindset that I call the tribes effect. This is an US versus them mindset. You could be in a conflict with somebody you love your mother, your kid, but the moment you get into this mindset, it becomes me versus you, US versus them. Think about a conflict in your own life. There are three basic characteristics to this tribal mentality. One, it's adversarial. It is me versus you to it's self righteous. I believe I am right and legitimate in my perspective and I believe you are wrong and crazy and element number three, this tribes effect. It is a closed system, so I will argue and defend my perspective to no ends, but I am going to close my ears to your perspective. This is the tribes effect. We fall into it in the family dynamic and unfortunately just as true national dynamics, international dynamics, we see the polarizations there.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Once you attach to a tribe, something strange happens. No longer is content as important. The substance of the arguments, the the policies that is important, but at the end of the day, the most important element in terms of being a part of a tribe is loyalty, loyalty to the tribe, and the most serious offense that you can commit against your own tribe is to betray that tribe's trust. It's loyalty. It's essence. It's to go against the tribe in some way. You look at the United States now, they're these huge political divides. You see the democratic tribe or tribes. You see the Republican tribes as well, and it's very difficult for either side to even say, I understand what you're saying because some on the inside of each side are going to say, oh, nope. They're betraying our tribe, and the moment betraying the tribe, that's a taboo.

Speaker 1:          03:23          If I break a taboo, I can suffer social punishments. I'm going to be excommunicated. I'm going to be ridiculed or worse. That's the challenge of our tribalistic world that we're in right now. So you can have somebody in Trumpville or Clintonville who, uh, you know, totally is getting hammered by. Well, let's say in the trump world, because totally going to get hammered by the by, it changes to healthcare, but they're still in that camp because they're part of the tribe. Recognizing that identity is critical. It sort of opens our eyes to what might be going on in the world around us and our communities around us. Think about some of let's think about some of the issues that are in the public sphere, abortion, healthcare, taxes, security of the country. All of these issues hit right to the core of our identity, who we are and what we stand for.

Speaker 1:          04:17          And the moment I feel that any of those elements is threatened now I moved toward the tribes effect. Now I want to move toward being with a group of people like myself who are going to protect me and my interests from becoming trampled on. And a powerful tool you can do is to emphasize the US, the two of us, you know, moving from ego to we go, there we go. And it's a big difference watching conflict situations. I've noticed something interesting, you know, at first people are battling it out, my perspective versus yours and all of the energy is moving toward my ego and my perspective versus your ego and your perspectives. When you start to see the transition, what starts to happen is that each side recognizes there's also an us, there's me and there's you, but there's also the space between us that we are creating together and the more you can emphasize the US, the more you can move toward real reconciliation or the two of you moving together towards some cooperative and sustainable outcome. I mean, looking at the rhetoric in the United States right now, there's so much divisive rhetoric. Where are the voices of us, the United States of America, and the more you get those kinds of voices, the more you can start to, in a sense, overpower the US versus them thinking. We're not trying to overpower. The idea is that the people have behind their us versus them thinking. We're trying to overpower that adversarial mindset.

Speaker 2:          05:58          Mm.
