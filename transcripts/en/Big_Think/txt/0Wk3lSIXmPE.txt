Speaker 1:          00:08          Sensory deprivation is where we put people in dark soundproof rooms or water tanks. People are becoming aware that we needed sensation, stimulation, variation, stimulation, all of us as much as we need to, a float in the water and so forth. The basic needs and deprivation of this kind of stimulation, uh, lead to, uh, some, uh, very uncomfortable states. Uh, so we, we asked is there a personality trait that some people need more stimulation or more variety or intensity of stimulation than others. And that's when we developed our first sensation seeking scale. And subsequently that expanded became the main focus of my research is the, uh, we were surprised by how many things were affected by this trait sensation seeking. And then we got interested in the biological basis. It's genetic and biological basis. And here again, we had some very interesting findings pointed to the fact that this is a very fundamental trait with biological roots.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Well, this is determined from twin studies called biometrics, have a behavioral genetics actually. Uh, and, uh, using these twin studies, we initially found that roughly 60 percent heritability heritability is the proportion of the variance trait that's determined by genetics. And we discovered there was 60 percent, which is very high for personality trait, which generally run between 30 and 50 percent. So 60 percent is high for a personality trait. Well, it's higher for intelligence and some other traits. So a little more recently, uh, oh, this was established, not only using twins are raised together, but twins raised apart showing that it wasn't due to the fact of sharing a stimulating environment. Let's say there was an environmental aspect of this, of the remaining 40 percent, some of those error of measurement, but some of it is due to environment, but it's not the shared where we go the shared environment shared in the family. It's due to the, uh, a non shared environment, which means your friends, peers, your unique life experiences that you have the other people in your family, you don't share with other people in your family.

Speaker 1:          02:48          We can surmise that the sense of particular gene has been found to be related to sensation seeking a dope, mean, receptive Jane, so that it's been there a long time. Well, actually they estimate that it's not old evolution, you know, maybe 50,000, 100,000 years old in our species, uh, this particular Jane, but there may be other genes that are older even, but you see this another, the point is you see what we might call sensation sick analogs of sensation seeking behavior and other species. In fact, a lot of my work has compared sensation seeking a expressions exploration, novel approach, the novelty and other species with the same explored this, that the extent that they have the same biological roots and Helen's and then other species. So in that sense, we look at evolution. We have a modern test of evolution when you can find something that exists in humans and earlier species, particularly primates, but also even in rats when you can find this and it's linked to the same biological indicators in both species, in both humans and other animals that indicates that has a revolutionary history.

Speaker 1:          04:08          Rather, it's more than a merely analogy, oh, this looks like what we do, but it's more than that. It's that the fact that it looks like sensation seeking and has the same biological roots, I would say the, uh, the age differences are somewhat larger if you're looking at the extremes. No, I would say like it like about 60, 65. A male would have half the sensation seeking store that he had when he was in his late teens, early twenties. So that's pretty much of a decline. Uh, the male female differences are constant across age, uh, but, uh, uh, perhaps not as large as when we talk about sex differences, you know, and traits. We're always talking about a lot of overlap for you about population differences. So people always say, I know someone who is a female, but it's very high sensation seeking. Of course, you know, there's variation within both genders. Just the overall population differences different.
