Speaker 1:          00:07          Spiritualities to experience

Speaker 2:          00:10          awareness, which is universal, and when we experienced that domain of awareness, which is beyond our skin and capsulated eagle identities, then we have the spontaneous understanding of love, compassion, uh, it becomes our nature not as a moral dictate, but something which is a natural expression of ourselves. It also gives us insight into the mechanics of how intention orchestrates its own fulfillment. Spiritualities, also a sense of connection with the creative power of the universe, the mystery that we call God a, and by having a sense of connection to that greater power, we gain self esteem and have the ability to create because we align ourselves with the elements and forces of creative universe. We begin to realize that the universe is creative, that is conscious, that it's evolving and our personal evolution is somehow linked to the evolution of the mystery that we call them

Speaker 1:          01:23          experiential. In

Speaker 2:          01:26          India it is trucked out to yoga, but most people have a misunderstanding of yoga. They equate it with the physical postures that they do in a yoga studio, which are one component of yoga, but yoga classically is divided into four types and they have to do with four basic instincts that human beings have, being feeling, thinking, and doing. So the yoga of being his meditation, self reflection, um, the ability to shut off the world of the sentences and go to the source of our own thought. It's called Raja Yoga. Uh, the second yoga is the Yoga of love through relationship and understanding that love is a, is the ultimate truth at the heart of creation, and that through relationship we can move progressively from attraction to infatuation, to communion, to intimacy, to passion, to detachment, to ecstasy, which is our ground state, the exaltation of our spirit.

Speaker 2:          02:38          So love and relationship is a second means of experiencing spirituality. If somebody doesn't understand spirituality, ask them if they've ever been in love. That's the experience of spirituality. That third way of understanding yoga or having the experience of spirit is through service. When you perform service without any selfish motivation, it's called Karma Yoga. Then you also get in touch with the same domain of awareness that we call spirit. And the fourth way of understanding spirituality is, uh, through the intellect, through the mind, through science, to understanding how the laws of nature work. Because the laws of nature are in fact the mind.
