Speaker 1:          00:05          What we're thinking about things we're already seeing. Um, uh, warm air holds more water vapor than cold. Um, the atmosphere is about 5% more moisture in it then it had 40 years ago, which is an astonishingly large change in a basic physical parameter. Uh, that means that we're seeing huge increases in the amount of day and downpour and flood. There's a record rainfall and flood event someplace around the world almost every week. Now, the hundred year storm comes to many places every three or four years. Uh, it's taking a great toll on infrastructure, on human life. You know, if this spring we watched, uh, hundreds of people killed in Rio, in the middle of Rio de Janeiro in mud slides after the largest rainstorms they'd ever recorded in that city. Um, uh, look at the chemistry of seawater. I mean, the ocean is the, our metaphor for vastness on this planet, but that hasn't stopped it from changing in profound ways.

Speaker 1:          01:07          See waters 30% more acidic and it was 40 or 50 years ago because the oceans are absorbing so much carbon from the atmosphere. Everything frozen on earth is melting. Glaciers are melting with great rapidity, uh, all over the planet. Some of them have disappeared in the western us, in the Andes. Um, um, you can go on for many days just listing the effects we've already seen. If we don't do things quickly, the effects that are coming as the temperature gets hotter and hotter will be even more dramatic. Uh, the latest studies indicate that by the mid to latter part of the century, we could be seeing grain yields for corn and soybean and wheat fall 20, 30, 40%. Um, that would be trouble of a, uh, a all encompassing sword, new planet. We need new habits, new ways of going about things. The biggest habit on our planet at the moment is a kind of, uh, addiction to economic growth and to the idea that growth will solve every problem that we face.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Um, that's a habit we're going to have to habit of mind really, that we're going to have to get out of. Uh, we've reached those limits to growth that people started talking about it in the 1970s when you melt the Arctic, that's a pretty good sign that you've gone too far. And so we're going to need to figure out instead how to build a world that is stable, secure, kinda hunker down that's built for, uh, uh, built for endurance, not for speed, a con. I think that means more and more than our economies will need to become more localized, less sprawling, uh, less vulnerable, more resilient. We can see that starting slowly to happen. The number of farms in the United States increased last five years for the first time in a century and a half. And it's because there's this local food movement that's building up that kind of resilience in place after place.
