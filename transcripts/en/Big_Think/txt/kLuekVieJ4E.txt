Speaker 1:          00:00          No,

Speaker 2:          00:02          I am Fred Wilson and I am the managing partner of Union square ventures. It's been changing the way I work for the past 15 years.

Speaker 1:          00:18          I see it as an, as an evolution, not really a revolution. So, uh, I think every year there are two or three new things that I use as part of my daily life that I wasn't using the year before. Um, and uh, you know, I think social media, whether it be blogging or I'm a social networking or things at the intersection of blogging and social networking, like twittering and so on and so forth, these are becoming incredibly more valuable to me as business tools. And they were two or three years ago, uh, I've used the phone less and less everyday. I used to say that when I got into the business, uh, in the mid eighties, the phone was the way that I did 80 percent of my work by the mid nineties, email had become the dominant form of the way I did most of my work. And the phone had gone down substantially.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Now social media and blogging and twittering and things like that have, have, have become the highest form of the way I do my work. Email has come down relatively speaking in value and the phone is almost completely gone from the tool set that I use to get stuff done now. Face to face interaction has been a constant. So, um, I see, I don't think that has changed one bit, you know, going to a board meeting or having a face to face meeting with an entrepreneur, um, in order to decide whether we want to make an investment is as valuable or more valuable today than it was 20 or 30 years ago. Um, so that hasn't lost any value, but the phone has come way, way down and now I see email coming down a lot too.

Speaker 2:          02:09          I think that several things going on,

Speaker 1:          02:12          I think that, uh, the, that this generation is going to be a, a very different kind of workforce and the workforce that businesses have known in the past, I think they will be a lot less loyal to businesses. They will be. I'm interested in maximizing the value of their career as opposed to the value of the stock of the company that they're working for it, unless they control that stock or own a big piece of it. So I think that the, we're looking at, I'm very much immersed, mercenary, mercenary workforce. Uh, we've already seen that in the technology business for the past 10 years, particularly among software developers in Silicon Valley. You know, there's, there's, you know, the best software engineers are constantly getting poached from company to company company and getting better and better deals along the way in the same way that a, I'm a film star or a music recording star would be constantly being offered a better and better contract to go work for somebody new. Same thing's happening with software engineers and I think that that kind of mindset about talent is what this younger generation's all about. And so they're all going to be about building their own personal brand and their own personal career, their own personal portfolio of what they can do. And then they can make themselves available to the market, to the highest bidder.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Well, so for us,

Speaker 1:          03:43          the biggest impact and in the companies that we've backed is that, uh, we can hire somebody, um, who is the best person for the job, uh, if they are not necessarily willing to locate. I'm taking here in New York City. So we have companies in New York City that have a software engineers all over the world. We have people in New York City that have product managers or whole customer services organizations in another location. Um, you can put your, your high labor cost workforce somewhere else than where your headquarters is and uh, and, and make it work. I mean, and this has obviously been going on for a long time, but this is a trend that will continue, uh, for, for all forever probably,

Speaker 1:          04:36          uh, I have been profoundly affected by this. I write a web log that is read by about 100,000 people a month. And, uh, within that group I'd say there's probably about 20,000 people who are sort of the most hardcore, you know, committed participants in that community. And I really mean community. These people do meet ups, they comment on my blog, they have offline conversations with each other, they meet each other, they go and do startups together, says this community that exists, I consider probably at least a thousand of these people friends, and yet I have met um, and advisors, right? Um, and I've maybe met 100 or 200 of them, um, but I'll get emails from people who I've been communicating with and dialoguing with for three or four years saying, you know, you need to go visit this company. I saw what they were doing yesterday and it's, it's absolutely revolutionary and, and I'll go do it even though I've never met this person because I, I know who they are.

Speaker 1:          05:41          I've been able to develop a relationship with them online. I've had conversations with them and discussions and debates and uh, and that's brand new that has never existed in the world of business. And we are leveraging that in our business. And I think that lots of people are leveraging it in all different kinds of businesses. Businesses are starting to engage with their customers using these tools in ways that they've never done before and they're starting to get feedback from their customers in terms of what's working and what's not working, what products are good and what products are not good, what people in their organizations are good and what people in organizations are not good. And um, and people are starting to develop a level of trust around this kind of blind or anonymous or semi anonymous kind of communication that they didn't trust five or 10 years ago because it was so new. But now people are seeing, yeah, I can trust that kind of feedback even though I'm not getting it in, in a traditional way.

Speaker 1:          06:43          So it's been going on. Last time programmers have been using something called IRC, which is Internet relay chat. Um, and they're these sort of form your own chat rooms. And so what programming teams have done for the better part of 10 or 15, maybe 20 years is they all come in in the morning and one person's in, you know, Vancouver, Canada and one person's in New York City. And one person's in, in Buenos Aires and another person's in Bangalore, they all come into this IRC chat room and they're writing code and talking to each other at the same time. And they're saying, yeah, how do I hit this database? What, what's the, what's the query I need to use? And the person who has the database guy in Bangladesh has, oh, you write this query this way. So they're collaborating using these online tools. So that's been going on for a long time now for um, you know, a marketing organization that's not as Geeky, you know, that's not a, that's not a, a good way for them to work, but they can use a Wiki, which is basically a website that exists inside the firewall and outside the firewall they can post questions to it that's happening.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Um, and there are, uh, there are even companies that are using facebook groups I'm in, which is kind of a public group, but people are using that even for businesses. So there are a hundreds, if not thousands of different tools that exists for businesses to do these kinds of things. And um, more, more being developed every day.
