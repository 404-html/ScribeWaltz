Speaker 1:          00:05          I don't think anybody should care about the gossip. It put it on my site. You know, you don't have to read it. The great thing about it is it's, I like to think of my website. It's like the Mcdonald's of the Internet. A lot of people love to criticize McDonald's, but yeah, it's still really popular and I love the French fries. I think gossip is

Speaker 1:          00:35          people's interest in gossip is nothing new. It's been around for decades. It's been around for centuries. The only thing that's changed is the media has become aware that a celebrity news can be profitable, so gossip or celebrity news is now mainstream news. I don't know, but I know that celebrity news is mainstream news. I know that Anderson Cooper has discussed Lindsay Lohan many times and he probably hates it, but you know what? He will continue to discuss about celebrity news and he will continue to talk about Lindsay Lohan. I would not insult the mainstream news by saying that it's a form of glorified gossip. No, I still think that mainstream news is very valuable. Invaluable.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Mainstream news is just doing their job. If they weren't making money, they wouldn't be able to provide us with the news. So they have to have that celebrity element there so that they can get ratings. But, you know, not all the times I, you know, there are those shows that have nothing to do with politics, but there's been a shift definitely over the last five or 10 years where there is a lot more celebrity content in mainstream news. I think celebrity news is only a positive thing. I look at it as, um, aspirational. It's a great escape for people and a lot of them love to fantasize. Like, oh, wouldn't it be great if I were famous to a, wouldn't it be great if I can, um, go to that shop and buy that fancy clothes that Kim Kardashian buys.
