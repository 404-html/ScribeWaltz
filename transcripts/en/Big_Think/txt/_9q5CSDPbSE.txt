Speaker 1:          00:14          Do an interview with you, Chuck Feeney with a billionaire who gave away all of his, uh, molly and he, he, he did it, he did it. I'll give you an example. I brought them onto the sales survival school for, for the artists language, and I was trying to encourage him to give some money to it. And when we released, he said to me this was, this was this good where parents had a financed by running ruffles and know there that will sort of fundraising projects and the kids were all in this big, this big hall and they were getting a brilliant education. So he's had the baby when we went through the whole thing. And I thought he was hiding impressed by it. He says, I'm not going to give them any money. And I said, why not? And they said, well, they're doing very well, but perhaps if I give them money they wouldn't do as well. So I would take a leaf from his, uh, experience of philanthropy and put it into sustainable projects.
