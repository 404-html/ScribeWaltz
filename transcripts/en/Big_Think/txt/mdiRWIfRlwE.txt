Speaker 1:          00:00          When I was a child growing up, I expected that we would have robots by this point c three Po and, and we still don't, in fact the smartest thing that we have is the Roomba vacuum cleaner. And so that means it's something went terribly wrong with ai and, and it, it forces us to ask what went wrong because essentially we've been throwing the smartest people on the planet at that problem since the 60s and it's been a failed problem. Um, the answer I think clearly is that we have to listen to what mother nature is doing. So since the 60s people have thought, okay, look, there's all this wet, biological gushy stuff. Let's put that aside and just figuring out what would intelligence take, how can we just do this from scratch? And that hasn't gotten us anywhere. The game now is shifting to saying, all right, how is mother nature accomplishing it?

Speaker 1:          00:48          The reason ai got stuck is because programmers have been saying, look, how can we solve this part of the problem and then solve this little part of the problem and this part of the problem. So if you, if you have a robot and you want it to pick up wooden blocks and stack them, programmers have traditionally tried, okay, let's solve the find the block problem and then let's, once we've done that, fine solve the pickup, the block problem, and then the stack, the block problem and so on. And this sort of division of labor seems like a pretty good idea, but it's never really gotten us anywhere. The difference with what Mother Nature does is she doesn't come up with solutions to problems and then tick the box. The brain is a, an end product of a chronic process of reinvention that, that Mother Nature always does.

Speaker 1:          01:37          So there's no single solution to anything. Instead, the brain is this collection of subpopulations that all solve problems and overlapping ways. There's no single solution. So for example, um, the detection of motion by the visual system, there's not just one way that the brain does that. There are multiple ways that were invented at different points in evolutionary history and they all, they all weigh in on the same problem using different mechanisms. Same with memory. We don't have a single memory system. There are lots of ways that memories get written in the brain. If we want to solve the AI problem, we have to do at the same way that Mother Nature did, which is build a machine that runs on conflict, that runs on reinventing solutions and having overlapping, um, solutions of the problem space. And that, I think is our best hope for unlogged jamming the field of artificial intelligence.
