Speaker 1:          00:10          We usually have the application on the website for about two months and we go out and do presentations at different schools. And sometimes that can be one presentation and the entire school comes as an assembly or you go from class to class or it changes based on what school. But we do presentations and you know, encourage cause the sign up. And then about a month or so before the trip, we go through the selection process and we picked the groups. And then from then we make sure that we have two meetings with students and parents and then two meetings with just students. Um, so that they get to know each other a little bit before we go. And we get to give them the history of our organization and what we've done, kind of what we're getting into. And then we fly down as a group. And in New Orleans we actually own a bus and we just bought a second bus, which was really exciting.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And, um, so when we're there, we drive around in our buses. But, uh, you know, the first day is mostly just flying and settling in, but they, the first full day we go on the levy tour and like we start with an orientation about the history of Nyt, know who we've worked with, um, how we've gotten to where we're at. And then we go out on the tour and actually see the different levies and see the different neighborhoods. And, uh, we give everyone an opportunity to kind of see with their own eyes and understand what it is that they're getting themselves into and the neighborhoods that they'll be doing work in. And, um, that's a big day. I mean, there's no physical work really on that day, but it's the roughest day for everyone because it's so emotionally and mentally draining because most people have never heard anything like this before or seen anything like this before.

Speaker 1:          01:39          So that's usually how that day goes. Um, and every night we have a debrief and basically the way that that works is we bring everybody together and we sit in a circle and we run by consensus. And so what we do is we sit in a circle and we have, uh, we have around and so every week everybody has about one minute to speak about their day and their feelings of the day or any thoughts. And once we've gotten around the whole circle, then we go into what we call crosstalk. And then anybody can just kind of interject and say whatever they want. And I've realized that, uh, over time that the, the round is really just kind of like a warmup for the cross talk because when people have the freedom to like really say what they want to say without so much time constraints, it all breaks loose.

Speaker 1:          02:21          And you never know what's really going to come up. But that's where the real learning happens. And, uh, you know, the first debrief that's of the levy tour are usually that just are mind blowing. And then each day following that, they, they are as well there. But they're different every day. And I guess starting on the second day, um, we now work with a bunch of different organizations and in the morning our students do physical work, whether it's gutting a house, rebuilding a house, uh, cutting down grass and yards. And now I'm big projects that we work on our building community gardens. And so we do that in the morning and then in the afternoon we go canvasing. And that's, you know, just knocking on people's doors and speaking to residents. And that's really the most important part of the trip because it gives our students a chance to speak to the people who are actually here for Katrina and who really lived through this and who are dealing with these issues day to day.

Speaker 1:          03:10          And they hear it from them and not from us, not from the media, not from the government, like directly from the people. And you know, we break people into pairs and they go and it, and it's really great on a number of different levels. One, it's a primary source for our students to really get information, um, to, it means a lot to the residents because really the, in the ninth ward, there's really only one house on a block in certain areas, you know, some places are more populated than others, but you know, a lot of it's, it's still pretty desolate. So to see for them to see volunteers from New York come down just to hear what they have to say. And you know, it's not about like filling out a flyer or, or, or doing a survey or anything. It's really just to hear what they have to say and, and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          03:52          So it means a lot to them. But for us, for our students, it's great because, uh, you know, they get a connection with a real person down there. And also the, the two people that we pair up generally probably won't have known each other yet. Um, especially earlier on in the week. And so just the experience that these two students have walking down the streets of New Orleans together and knocking on homes and meeting these amazing people. I mean, it bonds them forever and you know, everybody, like two people who would have never ever second given each other a second look ever before. It could be best friends by the end of that one day.

Speaker 1:          04:28          Well, I guess the most, the most dangerous work that we have is also the most fun work. It's gutting homes. And we've been doing that since the very first trip. There are less homes, the gut now than there used to be. Um, but we still, I mean, we just did one this February. We're probably going to do some in April and I mean, would, that means it's basically stripping a house down to the bare bones and the bear foundation of a house because the homes that were lucky enough to stay standing in New Orleans, especially in the Ninth Ward, still had 20 feet of water for about a week. So everything on the inside was destroyed. So we have to go in and we have to knock down the walls, uh, take out the furniture, the sinks, electrical, everything, and just strip it down so that it can then be rebuilt.

Speaker 1:          05:08          And usually everybody loves to do it cause they get to use sledge hammers or you know, take their anger out on a wall or something like that. And you know, people love to do that. Um, but it's, it's pretty safe. I mean, one person in our three years has stepped on a nail and it was our teacher who told us to get tetanus shots and he didn't. So that's his fault, but he was fine. Um, and, uh, so we've never really had a problem with that. And otherwise, I guess, you know, with rebuilding homes, we're always with professionals, like people who know exactly what they're doing, who can handle, who really handled the heavy machinery. But we have worked on dry walling and sanding and, um, mudding and painting and all, all that type of stuff.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Another big part of the physical work is mowing lawns. And a lot of people at first are really just not excited to do it because it's mowing lawns. You can do that anywhere, I guess. But what's the reason why it's so important is because, uh, the city of New Orleans created this law called the good neighbor law. And it says that at this point, if anyone's grasp reaches above 18 inches there, then fined $500 a day by the city. Um, and so, but, but there's still about 200,000 residents of New Orleans who are, who haven't been able to come home that has spread out in all 50 states of the United States in you have 6,000 of them still in New York City right now. There are thousands in Texas. There's some, even in Alaska, I mean, talk about culture shock being taken from New Orleans and being relocated there.

Speaker 1:          06:34          But, um, you know, there's still everywhere but in their homes and the government is still mandating that they come home once a week to mow their lawns and if they don't, they're going to find them, uh, um, money that they can't afford. So, you know, our job is really to go in there and, uh, mow their lawn so that these people don't have to pay their fines. Usually we go and mow the lawns of people who we are in contact with, whether they're in New Orleans or people that we know that have, that are still displaced. But if we like run out of the list, which doesn't happen very often, but sometimes then we'll just go and drive. And if we see a lot that needs to be cleared, we clear it because we know somebody somewhere is paying. Some is paying $500 a day for that.

Speaker 1:          07:15          So I'm not, even if we don't know the person personally, like we want to, we know it's helping someone. So that's another piece of the physical work. And then, uh, working on community gardens is, is a newer project. We, we've just started to do that this year. But um, it's so important. I mean, it's, it's one of the most important things that we're doing because in, in the lower ninth ward itself, there's only one grocery store and it's much more like a Bodega and they pretty much just sell alcohol anyway. And so the people either are resorted to go there and buy really unhealthy food, um, or travel 20 miles outside of the city, outside of the ninth ward to go to a bigger grocery store, which a lot of people can't afford to do, uh, all the time. So what is so important about these community gardens is that it's creating sources of food and healthy food, fruits and vegetables for residents to, um, to eat within an, and it's being grown within their own community.

Speaker 1:          08:14          And it's also providing jobs for members of the community who otherwise don't have any, uh, because they can work on it. And one major thing is that we're working with, we helped start there. There also is an, uh, a high school in the whole lower ninth ward anymore. There were two and the government actually, uh, tore both of them down, one of which in the middle of our us being in there, uh, gutting it. Uh, we had a group there and they forced the entire group out and they knocked it down right in front of us. This was two years ago and it running right now there's nothing in its place. It's just grass. They haven't done anything with the land. So it didn't really make sense to me. But either way they tore both of the buildings down. So one of our projects has been, we've helped start now the only high school there.

Speaker 1:          08:55          It's really a technically a homeschool but it's, it's all that the people have right now. And I'm one of our teachers who taught at our school, came down with us this past summer and just kind of decided not to come home and he stayed there and he helped start the school and he's getting more and more students every week. And uh, he has actually gotten the rights to the land surrounding the school and we're turning those into community gardens. And right now we fund finance the school based on our fundraisers. But the goal is once they are really growing fruits and vegetables, the students will learn how to garden and how to farm, which is great for them, for them to just know. But also they can then sell those fruits and vegetables and that money is what's going to finance this.
