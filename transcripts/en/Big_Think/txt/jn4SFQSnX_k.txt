Speaker 1:          00:09          Change also in the, in the, in the critical arena of food journalism when I was a kid and I started like, you know, reading magazines and in reading cookbooks, just, you know, for recipes and that kind of thing. I mean, there was um, had Andy Burchette, a government magazine and Mimi Sheraton was reviewing the New York Times. Now the, with the Internet magazines, you have so many outlets for food criticism. Um, it's just, it's who keeps up with it really, you know, and he'd other the reviews the matter, you know, uh, the New York Times, New York magazine as far as New York goes. And then, you know, the Internet is a, it's a funny place. Um, you know, there's a real difference between, um, Jeffrey steingarten who has traveled all over and this has years and years and years about writing about food than just someone who's very enthusiastic about food. Um, and, and commenting on it because to really criticize, I think dishes for what they are, it's, you know, if you're really criticizing it, you should have perspective and you should have a historical perspective.

Speaker 1:          01:30          You should have a taste per se, you know, a perspective, you know, before you really can talk about a ramen shop, you probably should go to Japan, uh, than, you know, just coming on, you know, are criticizing it because if you like it or not, um, or if, you know, the same thing goes with Haute French cuisine or a traditional Italian dish. Um, but then again, you know, it's like, it's like one, um, you know, the wind gates could talk about wine till they're blue in the face, but my dad just, if it's good, it's good. He likes it, he likes it. So it's a, it's a funny situation, but because there's the enthusiasm and then there's the criticism. But critics have agendas. Um, it doesn't matter if you're a music critic or a movie critic or a restaurant critic, there is an agenda you might like, maybe you don't like Italian food or you think Italian food can only reach so high on the, um, uh, excitement meter, um, or maybe you only really want fine dining restaurants and you don't want casual restaurants or there's always some kind of agenda. And that's where the personality of of uh, you know, when the writing comes out, I had a, have a very, very, very famous food writer who will go unnamed, said that a restaurant reviewers only review for other restaurant critics. I'm a little bit like restaurant designer is only designed for the restaurant designers and movie critics only. It's kind of a phenomenon. Uh, some people love what I do and some people hate it. And that's always going to be. I'm always going to be the situation.
