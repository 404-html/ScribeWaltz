Speaker 1:          00:09          Vaccines, um, have a variety of guises. So some of the Audi vaccines, well known as attenuated vaccines, that's is the infectious organism had been changed such it could still replicate and even body but not cause disease. And this is what happened with the first vaccine. Um, I couldn't fight by Jenna using cow pox as a means of preventing smallpox and a cow pox, uh, had sufficient similarity to smallpox. It could elicit, induce an immune response, which was protective against smallpox. So that was a whole, uh, live virus which was used to prevent smallpox later on, people using what's known as killed vaccines. So influencer is a good example where influenza is grown up in eggs or tissue culture. It's then killed and then administered as a killed virus to the individual via hypodermic needle. And those proteins are seen as being foreign by the immune system.

Speaker 1:          01:22          They are an infectious disease. They don't belong to the body and therefore an immune responses mounted. More recently people have been able to identify specific proteins from an infectious organism. A Nice example is the hepatitis B vaccine where the surface protein, a isolated from the virus via genetic engineering and just that single protein is grown up purified and then used as a vaccine and just the immune response to that single protein is able to prevent the individual from becoming infected by the virus. So there's numbers of ways that one can generate a vaccine, tremendous amount of change over the last 20 years. Part of this has been enabled by the, uh, molecular biology revolution coming out of the seventies and eighties, which allowed us to clone and express proteins from various infectious diseases, uh, particularly viruses, bacteria, fungi. And being able to work with those proteins has enabled us to get a better understanding as to how those infectious organisms, uh, infect individuals, how they evade the immune system.

Speaker 1:          02:41          And specifically it's allowed us to find Achilles heels for the various bugs, whether it'd be for antibiotics, targeting various proteins and bacteria to prevent them from replicating or antiviral trucks where we can inhibit a viral to prevent the virus from replicating in a human cell. The genetics have been very important for us to understand how to make better vaccines against some of these infectious organisms. And really just studying these, uh, bugs, uh, at a very detailed level and their interaction with the immune system helps us understand how we could perhaps help the immune system do a better job at preventing infection. So generating vaccines that don't utilize the whole, uh, infectious organism, just using parts of it, uh, and by generating what we would call a neutralizing immune response, whether it be antibodies which bind specifically to, uh, proteins on the bug and effectively take it out of circulation and prevent the person from being infected. The science around infectious diseases has been really quite key to our understanding, uh, and give us some really key insights into, uh, the immune system. And based on our increased understanding of the immune system over the last 20 odd years has enabled us to discern how we could perhaps, um, use the immune system to manage disease in a way that people probably hadn't thought about. Um, only a few years ago.

Speaker 1:          04:27          Being so interested in vaccines and seeing how much, uh, you know, potential they hold for us. I think we have to see Jenna who effectively invented vaccination as being, uh, a tremendous, uh, um, stalwart and inventor in the area. So he probably is my number one public health hero, but then we have to go to people like saul can, saving who invented the polio vaccines, and, uh, you can go on and on, but I think it's probably because the vaccines have had such a major impact in improving public health throughout the whole world. Uh, that one has to look to the vaccinologist as, uh, being public health heroes.

Speaker 2:          05:17          Yeah.
