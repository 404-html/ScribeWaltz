Speaker 1:          00:09          Sometimes the symptoms don't show up right away. Um, and there's a kind of natural healing that can go on just by leaving a war zone. And sometimes it's not good to talk to people we think now right afterwards, but rather to almost let the wound heal a little bit on its own. Um, but some of the symptoms were aware of and you know, uh, and they will be, um, a hypervigilance being in a sense, hyper sensory mode. So walking the perimeter are listening with a cuteness the way you would in a battle area. Um, or it might also be flashbacks. Um, inability to sleep or just one moment, one of my soldiers to rob kiss low, just found himself in a bar with his arms around someone's neck. He strangled this guy. Um, and then he, and then he realized that he had heard something and thought he was in fighter mode and it just slipped into fighter mode imperceptibly.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Um, and that was about a year, you know, after battle he was in, he was, uh, a long term patient at Walter Reed and being treated by the way for physical injuries, um, loss of arm use, titanium armor placement in a and a leg replacement. Um, other times it could also just be this numbing that you, you've, you've had to, um, you're exposed to the sorts of stresses that are so superhuman that you have to protect yourself by numbing and you, you continued to dissociate afterwards. So those are some of the physical, you know, the physiological effects that we're familiar with. But what I'm trying to explore, um, are the, the spectrum that doesn't necessarily, um, in, in what may include some of these, but also includes these con conflict feelings, get sexual feelings of feeling some guilt for what you did or what you saw and did your best, but couldn't help to do even better than you wished you could have done to survive about all.

Speaker 1:          02:05          Um, when your buddies does don't to be part of an accident where yours no fault at all, no culpability, but you, um, but, but you were implicated, causally implicated, and you hold yourself really accountable or to love your buddies more than you love your spouse or your family. And you know, one of my soldiers said to me, you know, I'm in a tent with someone day in and day out and I know, and he passes wind at night. I know that Fart, you know, and he said, how can I tell my mother that I am? Was that, um, physically close to someone so that the feeling of betrayal almost of your home family, because you reattached to others who've got you through it, are also feeling that life has darren boring at home when you've been so wrapped up in revved, revved up and hepped up, that it's hard to want to, hard to find the same kind of thrill and adventure even though it's filled with danger.
