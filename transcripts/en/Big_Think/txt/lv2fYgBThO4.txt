Speaker 1:          00:06          Nowadays, it's incredibly hard to stay focused. There's so many distractions that are around us at any given moment. Um, your pocket vibrates at any given moment. A cause bigger, getting 10 new emails and on social media there's all these new notifications and the phone is ringing and your kids need help and your colleagues are coming up because you are working in an open office plan and they're asking you to chime in on some memo. Maintaining focus nowadays is harder than ever before, but in some ways it's way more critical to, one of the things that we know about the most productive people and the most productive companies is that they create ways to enhance their focus. They, they manage their mind in such a way that they're able to focus on what's important and ignore distractions much better. And the way that they do this is by what's known as building mental models, essentially telling themselves stories about what they expect to see, engaging in this kind of inner dialogue about what they think should be happening that allows their brain almost subconsciously to figure out what to pay attention to and what to ignore.

Speaker 1:          01:11          One of my favorite examples of this is a big study that was done of nurses in Nicu as some researchers from a group named client associates went into some hospitals because they wanted to figure out why some nurses were so good at paying attention to the right things, whereas others got distracted by all the noise and bustle around them. And what they found is that the best nurses in Nicu is, which is the neonatal intensive care unit who are handling these babies. The nurses who are almost had a sixth sense or an esp about figuring out which babies were sick and were getting sicker. We're the ones who were constantly telling themselves stories about what they expected to see as they were walking around the hospital. So one of my favorite interviews from this study was with a nurse named Darlene. Darlene said that what she would do is that she always was keeping a picture in her brain of what she thought that the perfect baby should look like.

Speaker 1:          02:10          And so she would walk through the unit and she would notice when babies didn't kind of match that picture in her brain. Right. And they would match. They would mismatch that picture and kind of odd ways. Like she might be walking past a crib and she might expect a baby to be crying because babies cry all the time. And so if a baby was being uniquely silent, she would go over and she would try and figure out what's going on. Like why is this baby being so quiet now to all the other nurses are quiet baby seems like a good thing. It seems like that baby is happy and it doesn't need any attention. But to Darlene because she has this picture in her head of what the perfect baby should look like when she sees a quiet baby, she thinks that doesn't match the picture in my head.

Speaker 1:          02:51          I need to go pay attention. And so she'd walk over and she'd see all these things that are all small issues on their own, right. The maybe the baby's blood was taken from its heel and instead of a dot of blood on the bandaid, if there's a little bit of a bigger splotch, um, maybe the, the baby's temperature is a little bit elevated, but nothing that like is out of place. Nothing that's worrisome. But for Darlene and nurses like this who keep this picture in their head, this mental model of what should be occurring, all of those things don't jive with the story inside their head. And so as a result, their attention is grabbed by it and they start saying to themselves, why? Why is this baby bleeding a little bit more than I expected? Why is its temperature off just a few degrees?

Speaker 1:          03:37          And in this case, they discovered that the baby was incredibly sick. Now there was not a lot of evidence that it was second. In fact, if they had waited half an hour, 45 minutes more, the baby actually probably would have passed away. But because Darlene noticed all of these things because the baby that she was seeing in real life didn't match the picture in her head. She acted immediately. They started, they started the child on antibiotics. The sepsis infection in its system was, was stamped out, but the only reason that Darlene was able to notice these warning signs, the only reason she sort of had this esp or sixth sense for something going wrong was because she had a strong mental model. She had a picture in her head that she was comparing reality too. Now, not all of us work in Nicu is right. We don't work in hospitals.

Speaker 1:          04:22          We're not dealing with life or death issues, but think for a minute about what it's like when you walk into a meeting and your boss asks you an unexpected question or you're, you're, I'm sitting there and you're, you're juggling the kids and dinner and suddenly your phone vibrates and it's this email that's, that causes the spike of panic. Our instinct at a moment like that is to react immediately to type something that we end up regretting later on or to answer our boss and blurt something out and we think to ourselves afterwards, God, I could've put that so much more eloquently. Why are some people so much better at maintaining their focus and not reacting and not getting distracted by all these things? It's because ahead of time they've envisioned what they expect to it to see they've envisioned what they expect to occur. So on the subway, when they're riding to work, they think about what is this day going to be like?

Speaker 1:          05:17          I know that I'm going to this meeting. What do I expect to occur at that meeting? And so when they walk in and their boss asked them some unexpected question, they their brain, almost subconsciously, he says, I didn't expect that question to occur. This isn't matching the picture in my brain of what I anticipated. So I need to put that question off. I need to to say, can we take that offline and I'll answer that later. Or they have a picture in their brain of what it's going to be like to to deal with the kids and to make dinner. There's some type of expectation and so as a result, when their pocket buzzes and an email comes in, they can say, I can't handle this right now. I need to give myself five minutes and I'll deal with this later. I use this all the time.

Speaker 1:          05:55          They used to be that when I would ride the subway into work, I would spend that time reading the paper or I would try and get caught up on, you know, memos or or something else. What I do now is I put everything away and I spend that 30 minutes just trying to envision what is this day going to be like because I know that the more that I have thought through what's about to occur, the more that I have a strong vision in my mind of what I should expect and anticipates, the more my subconscious is going to be able to decide this is what you should focus on. This is what you can safely ignore. I'm trying to train my brain by just doing a couple of minutes of thinking through what's about to occur to make better decisions about where my focus should actually be. Go.
