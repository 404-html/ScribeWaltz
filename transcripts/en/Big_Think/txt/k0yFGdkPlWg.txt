Speaker 1:          00:10          An interesting statistic with Malawi is that its forests are being stripped of its soft pine because of the amount of coffins that are being made because of aids related deaths. So, you know, you just expect this place to be sort of gutted and sort of just an inferno of misery. But it was the act opposite. Um, I, one day the longs that, that the end of the story is because the beginning of the story is long, but I got lost and I was walking on the side of a road in Malawi. My cell phone didn't work. I really had no idea where I was. My, my guide or the person who was driving me didn't know where I was. And I'm sure to some of the people who were driving past it must've looked quite strange to see what they call, I believe I'm, I'm deemed Emma Zuniga there, which means white person on the side of the road.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Um, and I kept on walking and I got to this gas station and I asked, could someone help me please? I don't know where I am. Um, I don't even know how to make a phone call to where I'm supposed to get back to. And this woman who worked there came up to me and she said, I can help you, would you like to use my phone, which was probably expensive for her. And she found, she helped me get back to where I needed to go. But as I was waiting for someone to pick me up, uh, they, uh, she said, what are you doing here? And I said, I'm here doing stories about HIV aids and women and women in Malawi. And she said, I'm one of them. And we formed this, this unusual friendship, you know, and that was like an experience that really like kind of as a, those people that you meet that kind of changed your life. Like here was this woman who works seven days a week, is a single mother. Um, she finds out while I'm there that her daughter is positive and she's supporting her family, her perspective husband gave her the illness and is outs and laughter and it's out spreading this illness as well among other women. But yeah, at this woman is the most graceful woman I've ever met and the most dignified woman I've ever met. And

Speaker 2:          02:33          yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:34          was so lonely because she couldn't talk about her status. But in spite of that, just exuded such warmth and such kindness and you know, it was really meeting her. You really saw the dichotomy of how cold her reality was, but this beautiful heart that existed in all of this and the grace that she existed in, in.
