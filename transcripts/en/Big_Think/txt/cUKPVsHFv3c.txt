Speaker 1:          00:09          To me, it's very interesting that it's so controversial, the fact that it's, it's not deterministic because throughout my life and medicine I have never, I very rarely get a test back that is so deterministic, so you know, even when I was pregnant and, and I get a variety of tests back and they say, okay, you're, this is cutting your risk down for having a down syndrome baby. But it's never, it's never 100 percent, um, unless I did the Amnio, which I did not do. So, you know, I've, and even things like cholesterol, if I, if I, if I find out have high cholesterol, again, that's a risk base. It means that I have a risk factor for heart disease. But it didn't tell me anything specific. It doesn't, you know, some people even do very well with having high cholesterol. It doesn't say specifically you are going to die of heart disease.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Um, so in my opinion, my, you know, I've been very comfortable with having diagnostic tests that tell me that I might be at higher risk or lower risk based on some, some information. So for the clerk to example that my husband has, he already knew that he had a family history of Parkinson's disease and now he knows that there is a genetic basis for it and that he carries that genetic basis for it. So, you know, again, he already knew that there was the family history he has up there and he has gone through a lot of the literature. One of the things that he's found is that it's not that well studied just yet because it was a relatively recent discovery, but there is information, there are about things you can do to prevent Parkinson's. So that could be changing your diet, exercising more and potentially drinking coffee.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Um, and those are all three things that he does. And, and again, going to the critics, all three of those things are great for his health regardless. So he has lost weight. He is much more vigilant about, um, you know, eating vegetables and he is trying to drink a little bit of coffee. So, so I'm really, you know, I'm really happy that we got that information because even if it comes out later that Oh, he has other genes that um, you know, decreases risk and therefore he's sort of at average risk for Parkinson's. You know, what I'm used to getting that kind of information in that kind of change in health care. And two, I'm happy because he made a lifestyle change that fundamentally made them healthier.
