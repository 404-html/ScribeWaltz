Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, there are a lot of flaws in the judicial system. I think we could probably do with that. Elections have judges, uh, uh, that creates problems. Um, I think that we could do a lot more to educate the judiciary in terms of a scientific evidence. We have a real problem there. It's a increasingly scientific evidence is becoming important in a whole host of cases, not just criminal cases. Um, and it's important that, uh, we have a certain level of scientific literacy, uh, in the judiciary, much less among lawyers. Uh, uh, so I think those are two problems. Um, you know, a psych at all of our politics, uh, money can make a real difference in corrupting the process of judicial elections. So we've, a, John Grisham has written a wonderful book about this called the appeal. It's very quick reading, but it's a very troubling, there've been a number of judicial elections for highest appellate courts in this country where moneyed interests have been able to basically go after certain judges.

Speaker 1:          01:12          They're really interested, uh, in their, you know, corporate cases, uh, uh, or maybe some tort reform case, but they're able to make some kind of ruling in a criminal case or something else. Uh, uh, look, very scary to the electorate. And, uh, they, all of a sudden outside money comes into estate in an enormous amount. And, uh, some campaign is run and judges are defeated. Happened to a fabulous judge in Wisconsin. Um, uh, it's happened all across the country and the most famous instances, one that the United States Supreme Court looked into in West Virginia involving the Massey Coal Company. And that was the coal company where we had that terrible accident in the minds recently, um, where, uh, the head of that coal company, I'm a put an enormous amount of money into the judicial election for the West Chester, West Virginia Supreme Court. Um, and then the judge who was the beneficiary of this, uh, uh, you know, sat on the case and, uh, the United States Supreme Court to actually ruled in this, uh, case that, uh, that had, uh, an appearance of impropriety. Uh, we know when we see it. And, uh, um, uh, reversed the decision in that case. So, um, that's a remanded it for reconsideration. That's a very, very extreme example, but unfortunately I think a lot of that is going around the country and that, that, uh, uh, I know that a Sandra Day O'connor, for example, feels very, very strongly about judicial elections being a real problem. And there's probably a lot of different kinds of merit systems, uh, that should be considered across the country.
