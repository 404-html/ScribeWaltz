Speaker 1:          00:08          Right when I was a kid in grade school, I would write really bizarre. I was always interested in, in, um, murder mysteries and murder and law and, um, and sort of the darker impulses of people. Um, so I would write stories about um, murderous matrons and, and, um, you know, serial killers who, you know, were re grandmothers and, and, um, would send these stories off to ellery queen and, and, um, Alfred Hitchcock and, you know, kept getting rejections. Of course I was like 15 and 14, so I, I really didn't expect anything, but I kept doing it just for fun. Um, and then I sort of gave it up and I figured, you know, nobody can really grow up and become a writer. I didn't think that was something people did for a living. It was sort of a fancy bowl thing. Um, and I had planned that go to law school.

And I, I like to argue with people and I like politics and um, but while I was in, in college, I got an internship at a Philadelphia magazine and, and, um, one of the things I had to do besides picking up people's laundry and opera tickets was a, in transcribing the interviews, it was way before anybody had machines that did that for you. So, um, there are a couple journalists who would, who would make me transcribe the interviews and they would say things like, you know, note how I ask this question. No, the way I sort of used in and this word and the way they answered this, mark that down. And it was a very calculated system of questioning that, that intrigued me. And, uh, that's when I started wanting to be in general.
