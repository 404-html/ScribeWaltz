Speaker 1:          00:07          Sebastian copeland, I a photographer, a lecturer and an environmental advocate,

Speaker 1:          00:21          jokingly referring to the age old conflict between England and France. And, uh, and my parents decided to challenge that tradition and we're not very successful at it. So, um, I was, my mother's British and my father's French, uh, uh, they separated and fairly early, but luckily they've remained friends. It was dysfunctional at first. It's, uh, it's challenging at times for a child, I think to be a bicultural, uh, but it pays off in spades later on in life. And so it has given me some tools to deal with a, with a variety and discrepancies between cultures and, and, um, and as it is now, I consider myself to be, try cultural because I've lived in America for a, an excessive 25 years with nothing. Yeah. 25 years or so. So it just, it's great to be able to, first of all, I'm bilingual and helps and then, uh, then try cultural in the sense that I can navigate between these different countries and feel I'm either not completely at home, but certainly not completely a foreign island.

Speaker 1:          01:27          My father is a, a, is a classical conductor. And, um, there is a long family lineage in that, a discipline. My great uncle was a, uh, was a very famous pianist who was Toscanini's favorite pianist. And so I was brought up in, in an environment of classical music and, uh, which translated later on in jazz. And then of course, through my rebellious stage, I translated, uh, not surprisingly, I suppose, in a, in punk rock. So I had a sort of a fairly broad, a range of, uh, musical exposure and a, until this day, I consider music to come any into two jars. And that is
