Speaker 1:          00:08          Short story

Speaker 2:          00:09          collection, so it was, I did it over a number of years, starting sometime in graduate school when I was 23 and started publishing things up through my twenties and so it was, I had been working on a novel and I couldn't crack the novel form at all and I just kept doing short stories in the background. And finally I realized I had 11 of them that I was proud of and that I, that could be a collection I hadn't meant to do the pattern of publishing short stories and then a novel. I thought I'm a novelist, I know it, but you have to kind of write a lot of bad novels before you can write a good one. I think. So I did that and, but meanwhile I love it.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Short stories.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Yeah. Yeah, I did. It was, they had a contest where, um, they would, for some reason someone in the past love music, musical theater. And so they would, if, if you wrote a musical, they would fully fund it and put it on the main stage with full costumes and the set and everything. And uh, my roommate, she said, we should totally do that. That would be awesome. She's the same one who talked me into competing to be a commencement speaker, which we did together. She always had ideas. She thought no one else was going to try for this stuff. So actually one of them we wrote the night before and submitted it and we won. So two years

Speaker 1:          01:35          that prize,

Speaker 2:          01:43          I've tried that and it felt really different. Felt like you were all the stuff. I think I'm good at like a description and internal experience and memory. You can't do that. Or at least I couldn't figure out a way was action in present time and it was so literal, uh, I felt really sort of bound as a storyteller. I think it would have. It's a good thing for me to learn how to do. I think I learned from it about visual storytelling, but place you can do that a lot more because they're a little more the audience. Imagine

Speaker 1:          02:19          the way they do in literature.

Speaker 2:          02:27          There was a variety of task. Wire was a fiction piece. It was crazy. I was a. That was the first thing I ever published. I sent it in. I was sending in dozens of stories all over the place against the rule. You're supposed to double submit. I just thought I'll send them everywhere. I must say I had 200 rejection letters and then I got a call from esquire for some reason. Everyone at esquire had quit the fiction department over some scandal and the assistant was left in charge and he, uh, published my story, you know, it was just luck. It was a cold pile.
