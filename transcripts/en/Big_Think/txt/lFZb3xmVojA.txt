Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, I always stay away from, I live in a place which has been cursed with interference by, by olders, we, we, the party that I represent a keep to a very, very, very rigidly neutral lane, whatever, people to hear a decide in terms of who your president does, who your congress members is, what your government does as a modern tardy for people who live here. From an artist perspective, of course we're entitled to say we want to Ireland to be part of that. And given that 46 million or so people here have their roots in Ireland, we think that should be a, an issue. And you know, at some moral at arden does partitioned, it's, it's, that's another gentleman and coercion into our affairs at con be stripped and dogs. And I'm quite sure that if a future administration decided it was setting that strategic interest to incorporate the British government to create conditions for our issue them to the dump would hop. And so without getting involved in any of the other, uh, issues, uh, I certainly would, would argue that it should be a martyr. And incidentally, it is the most successful foreign policy position, uh, at this time. I mean, the red is based process in many ways. A held in its infancy by President Clinton continues to be helped by the Bush administration. It's, it's, it's the success that has worked and it would not have worked except for Irish America and for the people who live here in the U. S.
