Speaker 1:          00:13          Oh, I think it's been terrible. Uh, you know, I think the whole embedding process was a masterstroke of the Pentagon's, a ability to sort of turn journalists into cheerleaders and I'm a co op and he sort of independent thinking it's very hard as a journalist to go into a conflict completely, uh, um, fresh eyed when you've been through training courses where you have to learn to put on a gas mask and nine seconds flat, uh, where you are traveling with US troops and you're expecting to be gassed by these terrible Iraqis at any moment and people are shooting at you as you go through a country and the people protecting you with the ones that you're supposed to be writing about as one part. Hopefully one part of a conflict. And unfortunately the, the, the, um, the coverage was very obviously one sided because there was no access to any other side.

Speaker 1:          01:15          And um, and there was for a while, you know, when Baghdad fell and as it was falling, a number of us left rm beds as quickly as possible and tried to get out and into a meet and live with a Iraqis in Baghdad. And, and that, that, that happened for a number of months before the kidnappings and the situation in, in Baghdad became so dangerous that journalists will no longer able to go out and freely report. And so, um, once again, we have a situation where most of the news, fresh news from journalists, at least Western journalists in, in, uh, in Iraq is being done from behind, you know, behind the lines of American troops. And I'm with only feelers being sent out for very quick runs into a, you know, the Iraqi. I'm a residential area.
