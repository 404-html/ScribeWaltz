Speaker 1:          00:03          One of the things that I think is depressed me most about our political system in the last decade or so has been the incredible partisanship. There's nothing wrong with people fighting about issues and having different views about them and arguing vigorously for that point of view, but opposing a point of view simply because it's the point of view of the other party, right? That's bad.

Speaker 2:          00:30          We hold these truths to be self evident. All men are created equal. I think you're going down by their creator, certain money leaving their America and they have a lot of money.

Speaker 3:          00:50          That was on my values. Moral values. We don't have to do anything but look right there and so yeah, for tomorrow's have dropped in this country, dewey, you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska. You cannot go to a seven 11 or a Dunkin donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent.

Speaker 1:          01:26          We're headed towards 2030 years of incredible chaos and turmoil.

Speaker 2:          01:33          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:35          On Iraq, on the economy, on healthcare, on a global warming. There's no real issue where the parties are grieving and the distinctions are huge.

Speaker 2:          01:57          These are the people that are connected with the Barack Obama

Speaker 3:          02:03          needs to return to Illinois and the Senate and get some experience and get out and live in the real world for a few years and get out of that elitist conclave. They called Barack Obama and elitist and they pretended to Republicans on their assigned sending mckeen. Her heart warming story when she was a kid is she helped her dad pick out a several hundred thousand dollars fountain in front of their mansion. John Mccain spurned one establishment, but ended up ironically embracing the other, which is the cultural conservatives. No question about it. I think the Republican Party understands better what's in the Bible than the Democratic Party. They demonstrate it. Metro. Yes. There's no reason to kill an unborn baby. God wouldn't want that. Republicans wouldn't want that. And Democrats want that. Um, it seems like it is John Mccain. Like he's a real guy. You know, he's had a real life. Don't think he eats a ruble. I seen him do hot dogs and hamburgers. This is the Huffington Post, always as loud. This is a chocolate smoothie buddy. Healthy chocolate got so I know any raw, organic, fair trade, Cacao powder, everything that's happening out in the world today is happening because there's a sense of it's us against them. This sense of other myths. You guys under our tech and you're responding with kindness. It doesn't work. I mean, you were in the heat of a battle to win this race. A bubble. Obama needs a sword and a shield. The Shield, which is secondary, is to fend off with vigor and strength the attacks, but the most important thing is the sore stand up, stand up, stand up.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Merck is based on ideas. We have enough intelligence. No to remove radical poverty in all parts of the world. Or the trick for the future is to find ways to recreate what used to be called the vital center. One question that I think it's always useful to ask is, if I am so sure I'm right, how come she social? She's right too. There's always the possibility to make change.

Speaker 2:          04:29          Good

Speaker 1:          04:30          big part of democracy is being the leader yourself.
