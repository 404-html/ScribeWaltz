Speaker 1:          00:13          It's interesting that modern jazz composers, some names at a middle that come to mind, people like John Coltrane when shorter, um, there was always directly, I'm Sandra, I'm a n, a deep appreciation and even a very deep intuitive understanding of modern physics. I'm into their music. And one of the things I like to do for fun is actually look for those connections. Like literally I talked to music composers and it's like this hobby of mine where I will take a culture in song or the chord changes and try to relate it to music theory. I'm at I'm, and physics. So one thing I found interesting is the notion that culture and came up with was something called, there was a, a sort of a musical and a musical illusion device in saxophone plane. See a saxophone can play more than one at a time. Um, it's monophonic instruments.

Speaker 1:          01:12          So, but what culture was able to do was to come up with illusionary, reflects on the saxophone record that, and it was called sheets of sandy color sheets of sound. Or another thing that he did was he figured out ways in which you can go to higher notes that the sex is naturally wasn't built to make and this user's ideas in physics like nonlinearity for example. Um, you know, that there isn't always a one to one correspondence between a wave and a note. And I mean, uh, you know, um, one wave, if I add two waves together, I get a third wave. There's not always a one to one correspondence. That's the difference between linear and nonlinear. And since music is way of cultural, is able to figure out techniques to do that, ways in which, you know, you can hear more than one note at a time.

Speaker 1:          01:58          And how's that relate to physics? Well, quantum mechanics is exactly an example of that, that a political really can be that if there is a probability incentive, a particle being here or here, then in a sense it's, you know, you can think of it as occupying in two places at the same time until you go and measure it. Okay. And the question is, well that's hard to get your mind around, but in a sense that's what the sheets of sound Coltrane was doing was like, because you are playing in many ways, many different notes on an instrument that can only play one note at the time, but there's this overall effect in which all those notes of coexistence. So what I'm getting, what the sheets of sound is going to be switching between different individual notes. So for example, I'm going to play a d, I got, I want my horn, but right and I'll play a g, I'm sorry. All right. And that's the. See if I play them very quickly for alright. But if culture and figured out alternative fingerings, why plan those notes in a rapid succession that you get an effect? Um, it sounds like.

Speaker 1:          03:30          So that's kind of the example of sheets of som I'll pissed him off was basically the sax normally can just go up to 30 this high f sharp. That's it, you know, that's a high f sharp for me. But then you can go further by using a nonlinear effect by using your diaphragm down here, by forcing the resonance resonance from down here so I can go up to my highest sharp.

Speaker 2:          04:21          Hello.

Speaker 3:          04:45          Actually, I'm working. Working

Speaker 1:          04:46          on a little album. Project is almost done and I'm, the title of the album is call and a lot of the songs inspired by, you know, my love for grid cool ideas in physics and how it's connected to jazz music in particular, but actually it has a lot of it, it, it's, it also explores the idea of diversity and creativity. So it uses modern rhythms like a Brazilian beat versus a regular Tom b versus a hip hop beat. So it uses modern rhythms with jazz improvisations. Combined it with themes, let's say I'm and impressions I'm having to do with cosmology and particle physics and string theory and the title of the album will be called mathematics because when I grew up in the bronx in the eighties hip hop music, um, there was a part of rap music were guys who battled each other on the streets.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Um, and you know, and sometimes the battle and we'll go into, you know, the subject matter would be talking about science for example, and they even called it dropping science. I'm like Eric, B and Rakim. And so I used to take the bus home from school and these guys would be on the back of the bus, you know, rapping, battling each other, drop in science, so to speak. And when one day, you know, I heard someone say, yeah man, I got, I got enough mathematics. So it also captures a big part of my, you know, what inspired me was that I was already living in us in sort of a sign that this rapping and improvisational rapping and talking about, you know, things are voluntary in the universe and stars exploding that I'm like the star exploding, you know, and you know, things like this planet rock Afrika Bambaataa wind the first rap songs out there. Um, so the title of mathematics sort of brings it all together.
