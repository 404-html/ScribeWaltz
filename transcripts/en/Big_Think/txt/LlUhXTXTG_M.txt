Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:11          I think Eddie artist's responsibility is first and foremost to create good art and I think hip hop. I'm certainly not the first to say this, probably not the first to say this on big thing, but hip hop has always been held to standards that I thought were unrealistic and unfair and standards that no other modern pop music forum has been held to as far as the our lyrical contents and how much we deliver a substantive message or whether we craft our music into a comprehensive handbook for how to live your life. I mean, I don't think anyone has ever looked at blues or jazz or country or any other form. No one has ever looked at John Coltrane and said he's failing as an artist because he didn't provide a detailed blueprint for political change in our country or a detailed blueprint for how to raise your children.

Speaker 2:          01:03          You know, because people recognize that the value of John Coltrane's music comes in its musical expressiveness. But with hip hop, a lot of people don't recognize hip hop's musical value. So they latch onto what's easier for them to understand. Which is the lyrical content and judging strictly on that basis. So I think hip hop gets a raw deal in a lot of ways, especially because right when hip hop was beginning to be discovered by the mainstream. It was right towards the end of what people call a conscious era with groups like public enemy who raised hopes very high for having this generation fill the void that had been left behind when the civil rights movement ended. Um, the black power era had ended due to cointelpro and self implosion and whatever else went on. I mean, I think people were hoping for some kind of voice to rise up and when you had public enemy and all the other groups around him speaking so compellingly, I think people got their hopes so high that they get really unrealistic expectations for how much these young musicians could really deliver.

Speaker 2:          02:04          As far as offering substantive social and political leadership. And I think, I mean, I working, working in sort of a left wing progressive circle of nonprofit media has always been a struggle for me to get people to recognize that hip hop should be recognized for his musical value first and foremost. And if we're making great music, then we did our jobs and if we're expressing something that's explicitly political or positive, that's great, but that's icing on the cake. If you don't have the foundation of great music underneath that, you know, it doesn't matter if it was all about the message and only the message. Cornell West would be the best rapper in the world, which I'm sure he would agree. Yes.
