Speaker 1:          00:03          You can't develop a perfect system. Somebody's gonna fall through the street, through the cracks, but they fall through the cracks in Europe and Canada below it. I'm just saying this, I like our system of innovation. I like to fight who mapped the human genome we did in America, uh, who's the one that discovered, you know, all the vast majority of new drugs in the last five years that are so helpful to curing illnesses, Americans, American research labs and American companies. A lot of the research companies are coming to America because we do have a cost structure that allow a company to recoup their investment of their research when it costs to take a drug from the laboratory to the bedside. And this is very important. And, uh, I don't think you will find that kind of support and they in a European system. And that's why I think it's so important for us to keep our, our own competitive system.
