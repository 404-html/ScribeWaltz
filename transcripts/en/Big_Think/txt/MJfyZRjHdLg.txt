Speaker 1:          00:10          Well, science is telling us that we can do phenomenal things if we put our minds and our resources to us. I mean, I think science is probably the best example of you put resources into something and you let the creativity and the brilliance of the minds throughout the world and certainly not only in this country, throughout the world, and phenomenally good things can happen. You've got to make sure that there's checks and balances on that because science can also lead to things that are not so good. You know? And that is a whole ethical issues of manipulating at the genomics, at the genomic level, the whole issues of, of embryos and creating people to your own fashionable boutique, liking all those things. You've got to really be very, very careful that, but science at its most pure where you're sweet, you're looking for discovery and you're going to use discovery for the betterment of mankind.

Speaker 1:          01:06          I think science stands out among more some of the most important, uh, endeavors that the humankind can pursue. Mankind evolves. I mean, there's no doubt that we have evolved the whole issue of evolving through various lower species. To our own species of the human. But there's also the continuing evolution, uh, uh, that is associated with mankind. And a lot of that is using what specifically and particularly and peculiarly makes you a human being. And that is your intellect and your will. You have a choice. You can analyze things and you can act in an intellectual manner. And that is to me that the very foundation of what science is, how you can better your own lot, the lot of the other citizens of the world while you're paying attention to and preserving the world you live in, which is the reason why things like the environment are so, so important. When we try and analyze all we doing things that are detrimental to the environment. And if so, how do we stop it? And if we have to stop it, how do we replace it with something that's environmentally friendly? And I think science is going to lead us there. And it's the goodwill that you have to try and preserve your own species as well as preserve the environment, I. E. Our planet. Uh, so that we can have thousands of more years of, of, of, of, of people doing good things and leading good lives.
