Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:13          what's changing is the idea that um, elections are controlled by a small group of professional campaigners, consultants and, and, uh, um, fundraisers and pollsters and the, the big media people who kind of write the, the frame that's all being opened up. And what we experienced in the United States was the first, uh, what I call it, mass participation election. Literally millions of people waking up every day and being involved in the election way before election day and mobilizing their friends in organizing events, in doing their own micro fundraisers in creating their own messages and spreading them online. Um, and that, that is a new dynamic when you have out of a country with maybe 120, 100, 30 million voters, 10 or $20 million of them that actively involved. It definitely changes the dynamic of politics and the world that politicians have to operate in. So that's the big.
