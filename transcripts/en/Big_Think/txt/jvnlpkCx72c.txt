Speaker 1:          00:10          I guess my personal philosophy almost always has to do with, with, in the most important way with the need that I feel everyone has for an artistic element in their lives and it doesn't matter what their profession or their that um, I think that I heard once that everyone, everyone in the world has written a poem. I don't know whether that's true, but it should be true. It must, something like, it must be true because I don't think anyone lacks what we would call an artistic impulse and what I feel more than sort of political causes that I might be interested in. I think the, the cause that I would embrace is the idea that people might be encouraged to experience even for a few moments in a day. The idea that, uh, that the imagination is ruling their, their life for a moment. Um, and um, that would be my prime cause in spite of the fact that, you know, I have occasionally I have written pieces with very frankly political subjects and I've spent moments in my life, you know, 19, 64.

Speaker 1:          01:30          I went with all of the freedom summer folks to Mississippi and with a group from, from here, and we, we definitely experienced an amazing moment in the politics of this country, but when I've addressed things like that in my music, it's been much more because it's part of a whole emotional complex for myself then that I want to convert we're or influence opinion because unfortunately the audience for such a piece usually agrees and I think, you know, if one were really to be serious about the prison, about moving people through the arts politically, you'd have to almost find a, select your way into an audience that doesn't like what you're saying, what you're saying. And very seldom of course, do we ever do that?

Speaker 1:          02:27          It does. It's probably the hardest thing for me to articulate because most of my life as a performer deals with forms of religious music. Um, and I certainly feel that when I conduct a Bach Cantata that I am a absolutely engaged by, not in an abstract way at all by the issues and by the stories and the experience. Um, but I can't, I can't find a formal structure for that. And um, when I write a religious text, I would have to say that I am as gripped by the ancient and the sound of the words and the feeling that they are carrying significance, a almost that has been a sort of gradually attached to them. I'm over centuries. Um, I would like to feel that, that all of the assertions were things I can assert and that's not really how I feel. But the King James Bible, I've come back to so often for texts and it, it was really translated at a moment where the English language, he had an extraordinary rhythmic and verbal variety.

Speaker 1:          03:57          It's Shakespeare's era and I find sometimes the passage, this passage that attracts me has unusual words or rhythms that I just find absolutely irresistible. Um, in addition to, of course it's, it's accumulated significance, but it's as much just a, a deep affection for a text, a love for a text as it is the whole world of doctrine from which it merges. And of course, like a lot of people who are dealing with church music. And actually work as a church musician some of the time, it's terribly unsettling to have to contemplate how much of the conflict in the world to this day is generated by religious groups, by people who are fired up about the doctrine. And it's difficult for someone like myself to embrace the institutional issues having from a semi historian's point of view, a pretty firm idea that they often lead to people fighting each other about it.

Speaker 1:          05:14          The hardest things, you know, compassion and forgiveness and a tolerance, which is also a really a hard one because, you know, some of those, some of the major issues in this country, you know, race. And, um, I'd have to even say a kind of intellectual tolerance. I'm very bothered that, um, many groups in this country are dismissive of other groups because they feel they're not as cultured, not as educated. I think we have a very tremendous attraction to intolerance almost bred into the early life of this country. And, um, so yeah, I would consider those, my major virtues. And also it's, you know, it's so hard to apologize for things and I'm always impressed by people who, uh, when they've done something really wrong, don't do the standard thing, which is to make it worse and ostracized, but actually go the whole way and try to reengage the situation. Um, and in our profession, our music profession, there are constant tests of those, uh, of those issues.
