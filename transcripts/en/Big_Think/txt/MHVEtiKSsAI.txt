Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, in general terms, I'm in the business of really creating intellectual capital or creating ideas, um, for uh, looking at a different way at very large, messy, complicated problems, all of which have something to do with competition and, uh, economic value and, and, uh, really delivering value in terms of organizations working. So, uh, it, it, it's, I started out with a fairly focused, although very complicated question, which is, you know, what makes some industries prosper. None others, uh, and then later what makes some companies prosper and others, um, but ultimately that, that core set of ideas and frameworks and ways of thinking gave rise to work in some very powerfully connected areas like economic development and, and most recently in healthcare delivery. Again, healthcare delivery is, is a large complex multidimensional problem, involves organizations delivering value who are competing in, in, in some way against other entities. And so that class of problems is, are the ones that I've evolved my work in, in, into, into looking at an. And although I have a hopeless, hopelessly broad bandwidth and the sense of working a lot of different fields. I work in the environment, I work in social responsibility, philanthropy. It all emanates from that common set of perspectives and ways of looking at an organization's doing something to deliver value.

Speaker 1:          01:48          Well, you know, I, I suspect, uh, just just, you know, traveling around the world and talking to people and meeting people that, uh, probably at this moment in history, I probably that'd be best known for this, the notion of the five forces because it's such a visible and, and, and, and sort of a sort of clear framework that when, when people encounter it, uh, all of a sudden it kind of totally changes the way they look, you know, at, at an industries and markets and, and, uh, a lot of students get exposed to it during their training and, and therefore it still sticks with them. I think probably the close second would be the, uh, the value chain, the notion of, of, of how we think about how an entity actually creates value and think about the cost of creating that value and in a systematic way.

Speaker 1:          02:42          I mean, again, if my roots are in economics and, and that's where my doctorate is in, in economics, there's a very simple conception of the firm which is there's a production function and there's labor capital that's converted into output and, and, and, and that's fine for many economic applications, but in order to really understand, thinking about strategy and competition and value, you need to go beyond that. So I think probably that then would come the, the diamond theory for looking at locations and clusters, which is a close cousin. So there, there's been a succession of these, of these frameworks. Um, and you know, I'm not done. I'm, I'm, you know, I, I keep, I keep pounding away at these kinds of problems because what I find is that today, as we, as we think about how ideas develop it, certainly in the economic and managerial domain, there's, there's a tendency to reduction reduced, to simplify, to, to partition, to specialize, to look at the piece, if you will. Not the whole. And of course, rolling Christiansen, my, My, my beloved mentor, you know, this was his sermon almost everyday in class that it's the whole, it's the parts are important, it's the whole, there's something unique about the whole and how you think about the whole and how you get the parts to fit together. And that's the essence of what creates true success in, in most situations. And so it's, it's that struggle to understand the whole and in these interrelated domains that, that really motivates me.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Well, you know, I, I, this is a horrendous answer for it, for a strategy professor, but I'm working on everything. Um, and, uh, I would say that I continue to try to advance, you know, all of my, my major bodies of work. But if, if you wanted to identify what would be the really the, the, the dominant intellectual agenda right now, it would be the continuing pursuit of this kind of body of work on healthcare delivery. And most recently, uh, through some relationships with folks at the medical school and elsewhere, I've really gotten interested in problems of global health delivery in, in developing countries settings. Uh, which again, initially looked like a totally different problem than, you know, healthcare in the US, but the more deeply I think in the more you look at that at first principles level, uh, you, you see that the problems are very, very similar.

Speaker 1:          05:07          So the hope is that we can create a partnership which allows us to better harness the massive amounts of resources that are now going into fighting diseases like aids and malaria and resistant tb by, by really revolutionizing our thinking about how to deliver care, see the, the, the, the thinking about healthcare in general and global health in particular has been dominated by the science perspective. You know, how can we come up with the better malaria pill or a, a, a way of, you know, using drugs to treat TB. And what we've come to understand is, is that the, that the gaining force is actually not the science. It's actually delivered and, and, and delivery is complicated. You have to see it as a system. You can't just look at the individual parts of how you do one therapy. Here are one therapy there. You have to see the overall delivery system and, and, and research in global health has not really been able to take that perspective, just given the scientific roots of, of, of, of most, of, of research.

Speaker 1:          06:04          I mean, one of the very interesting issues in, in, in, in, in this may be a whole new subject we could talk about for hours. This is the nature of intellectual endeavor and, and, um, and, and even in business and even in economics, we keep trying to make every problem into a physics problem where, where you're down at the micro micro, micro level and there's little particles behaving on the basis of a few forces that we can model mathematically and then simulate. And so what, what we're, what we're, what we have in most important things in the world. We have these complicated human systems where there's lots of complexity and multidimensionality and interdependence and, and, and we simply keep failing whenever we don't capture that in our ways of thinking in our frameworks. And so that, that's Kinda what I try to do, uh, uh, with, with varying success and, and, and constantly learning.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Okay?

Speaker 1:          07:04          Oh Gosh, there, there's, there's, there's, there's so many interesting people doing, doing interesting work and, and I, I'm, I'm very, a collectic in the sense that I think all kinds of work can actually contribute to our knowledge of these phenomena. I mean, you know, in, in, in the area of health, uh, I think actually the practitioners are ahead of the theorists, uh, so, you know, people like, uh, you know, Paul Farmer and partners in health I think are the ones that are on the frontier of new delivery models. Really. You don't see it in the academic writing. Um, uh, you know, I'm, I'm very taken with a lot of what's happening here year around the Cambridge community. I mean the brode institute and the ability to kind of, uh, kind of marry science and practice in the human genome project. I, I get very excited about that.

Speaker 1:          07:57          Um, in, in the economic sphere. I think the growing awareness that people are not robots and, and, and their behavioral phenomenon that guide, you know, how people make choices in the economy. So the scholars that work on behavioral finance and um, and, and it's kind of simulation of, of how of how, uh, actors really make choices of which there are a number, uh, here in Cambridge and elsewhere are good. So those are the kinds of things that attract me, um, um, you know, people that are, are trying to bringing a, kind of a fresh, new perspective to a problem that was sort of received and well understood. I would say that, um,

Speaker 2:          08:40          okay.

Speaker 1:          08:41          You know, I believe that the, the sort of frameworks and, and ideas and ways of looking at these, this series of problems, um, I think the most important contribution is that those ways of thinking have, um, if substantially affected and transformed thinking in those respective fields. Uh, and, and that's ultimately what I care about. I, I'm, you know, like most of us here at Hbs, I, I'm deeply, deeply rooted in practice. I, I, what I really care about is not so much the publication or the idea in its own right, but, but actually the ability of a practice, a practitioner to do better, to, to deliver better value, the ability of a government official or, or, or, or, or, uh, another stake holder to actually make better choices in terms of developing the economy of a particular region. Um, it, it's really changing the way people think and uh, and, and, and seeing that reflected in, in actual practice. And that's when I'm, I feel like I've made my biggest contribution and I feel, I feel like, you know, that that contribution has, has, has been, has been meaningful. Um, and, and uh, again, that, that cuts across a variety of different fields. But wherever, wherever that happens, that's, that's the contribution. I think I'm the proud of stuff.

Speaker 1:          10:10          I think as we look at questions like strategy or, or, um, um, economic development or, you know, read, restructuring, healthcare delivery or revitalizing intercity economies, you know, through, through different sets of policies. I think, you know, and this may be a, this is always a dangerous thing to say, but I think that we are much closer now to understanding what it is that works. Um, so, um, now the, the, the real critical questions we often face are given even even if we know what works, how do we actually mobilize a community or a set of actors or policymakers actually do that thing. So again, we see this an economic development all the time. Uh, you know, I can take, take you to 10 countries and we can, you know, I could literally in 15 minutes we can identify six or seven critical policy priorities that will make an immense difference in the wellbeing of the citizens of that country.

Speaker 1:          11:17          And yet the stuff doesn't get done. It doesn't get done for a variety of reasons. Partly it doesn't get done because people don't have the right ideas. Bad ideas are, are a huge part of the problem in this world, but it also doesn't get done because we don't understand exactly yet how change processes work, how to mobilize those change processes. So it's really the thing that keeps me up at night is, is, you know, how can we get participants in these, uh, in these complex systems where there's always multiple participants and they have to sign of agree and work together to come up with it with a good outcome. How do we get them working together? It's kind of worth it. Chris Argyris and others who, who work on sort of change processes and constructive reasoning and how, how people can actually learn and adapt and change. Those are the issues I think are, are really the compelling issues now in more and more aspects of society. Um, it, it's, it's not the what, it's, how do we get there?

Speaker 1:          12:22          Well, I mean, I think there has been a big divide between those who think about those who act. I think certainly my, my work and whatever success I've had is partly because I had been able to break that divide a little bit and be very, very informed about the phenomenon at a great level of tail. Therefore, the theory and frameworks that I develop capture complexity rather than abstract away the complexity. Um, I wish more academics would, um, would, would, would do that would sort of live that bridging themselves rather than see their role as, as solely solely the thinking part. Um, um, and um, you know, I don't know how to create the right incentives and values in the fields to do that because, uh, uh, you know, right now the pressures are a little bit the opposite. Uh, the, the pressures are to specialize to focus on refereed publications in the academy and you get very little credit for, for going into the field and, and, and engaging the practitioners and understanding the phenomena firsthand and therefore getting better insights into how to apply ideas. Um, that's, that's, that's fairly rare and very hard to sustain so far. Now what you find is that the people who can actually do that and we'll do that, uh, can often have huge impact, but perversely, I think the sort of the immediate incentives that many, many scholars feel or are really not to make those investments. So it's a real, it's a real challenge on this fragmentation of knowledge and ideas. Um, is, is, again, one of, to me, one of our compelling issues, not just in academia but also in society as a whole.

Speaker 1:          14:12          That's the market failure and uh, you know, how we, how we think about solving that market failure. And uh, now, you know, I, I, I sense a glimmer of change in, in some of the very young people that I encounter now who are more problem focused then literature focused or, or, or, or fields focused. And if you, if, if you're really, if your real passion is solving societal problems, uh, or a puzzle, um, and you can stay grounded in that, that helps you kind of work across across boundaries. But, um, and I think if have a new generation of, of, of, of young people who, who really are passionate about the problems that they see in the world and can really have that be their highest calling, I think that would be very optimistic. Step forward.
