Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:11          no, I mean it's a company of a, of a, of a famous people have people that want to be famous with blurbs all around it and it's supposed to be. And uh, you know, that's supposed to be creativity in journalism. My God, it's unbelievable. It's shocking. I mean, how can happen 200 magazines, you know, do the same cover, you know, that that's always there and advertise to go home and watch advertise. I watch the commercials on TV and I really, I'm, I'm not kidding, I don't, I don't really understand what, what the hell. I mean half of them, I don't understand what they're talking about and, and most people don't understand, even if they see something that they kind of enjoy, they don't remember the name of the product, you know? So I mean, I think, uh, I don't, I don't see any, I mean these people to keep talking about it.

Speaker 2:          01:09          We're on the advent of coming up with the creative evolution. I don't see it, you know, I don't. At the same time, I know there's got to be talent that they add on. I'm not sure who it was telling them what to do. Yeah, you have to have an understanding. You have to understand, have an understanding that everything that I go back to what I said before, everything you do it. You have to have a solar farm. If you come up with an idea, a big idea it if you, if you show it to somebody, your wife, your friend or a client, they should go, holy shit. They should your head coach and go back and forth. You know, it should be such and such a surprising idea. The only chance you have to do anything. That's bullshit. I has to be a shock when you first see it.

Speaker 2:          01:55          You know, and what people do is they, they, they, they, they just. So the, so the work is so unambitious, you know, a television commercial is a little films, you know, something's going on and you don't know what's going on and just say, well what is it about? And then you're looking for who the client is. And then when you see it you say, oh, I don't get it. No, I'm sorry, I tried to. It's a wasteland of a creativity, unfortunately, and I can't believe they're hidden talent that day because I know I pay people. I have fans who profess your love of my work, et Cetera, et Cetera, to kind of be something you to learn from it. I went, they got to be learning from it is that when you do something, it should be an issue. We had not got idea, you know, and, and in most cases, certainly in certainly in an editorial and in which I already did for 10 years for it, for esquire and I and now in the museum or not, but, but, uh, but you have to eat when you're.

Speaker 2:          03:00          Every cover is when it hit, when it was on a newsstand. Peep some people. What? I mean, the culture went ape shit on some of them. They looked at anybody. Well, um, um, you know, go to a new standard today. You never forget about something being culturally being a culture busta. There's nothing there that you could possibly remember. There's an ad today and about hearst there today, but with three magazines I talk about they're getting awards, etc. Etc. And you look at thE cupboards and uh, uh, I don't know nothing, you know, they're all the same cover, you know?

Speaker 2:          03:46          Well, that's the, that's the big problem, you know, I mean, I'm talking about people or about a young designers not, not being ambitious enough, et cetera, et cetera. One of the problems is, is that, you know, certainly in, in magazine design, there's a lot of terrific talent, uh, doing editorial. I meAn, when you get this society publication designer sends, there were awards every year ago, a book, you know, and uh, and you'll look through it and it's a lot of terrific threads in it, a lot of exciting stuff going on. You know, there's talent there and then they show the best coverage of the year. And then at the end, nothing, you know.
