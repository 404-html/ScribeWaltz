Speaker 1:          00:03          I tried to hear everything that's happening and that that can be very, very difficult. And, and someone who tells you, Oh, I hear everything that's happening on stage is lying cause there's, there's almost no way I think to really do that. But as an exercise, I do try to identify, okay, what does that musician, the third flute playing? And I tried to make sure I can hear that, but you have to hear what's going on because if you're, there's a way I, I've used the analogy, it's like it's like a ball, a very big ball. You can affect the way the ball rolls and you can change the direction that the ball is rolling if it's already is, if it's already in motion, but you can't suddenly have a turn, an abrupt angle. There's a natural way that the, the ball can be guided. So even though you're steering the ball, there's a natural momentum that the ball has that you can't interfere with.

Speaker 1:          00:54          So if the orchestra has a certain flow, you can affect the flow. But there's a natural way to do that. And there's a way that actually would interrupt the natural flow. So it's not that you can just do whatever you want. You have to take into account what is happening and what is being offered from the players. So that means really being in touch with what they're doing and hearing them as well as you can. And it's surprisingly difficult to, to really identify not even with two or three or four lines, but even just one line to really hear what the, the will and the, and the sense that the players are giving to one line to really listen to that and to actually be able to react to it in a meaningful way is surprisingly difficult.

Speaker 1:          01:37          Well, that's difficult. And, and what happens is, um, if there's more than one current, if they're conflicting currents onstage, then you have to make a choice. You have to either give in or insist. And for the other musicians on stage, if they sense two currents, if they say for example, if I show one thing and they hear a response to that, that is not in sync, then they have a dilemma they have to choose. Do I go with what I see from the conductor or do I go with what I hear? And so I very often tell, tell the orchestra's, even the New York Philharmonic, I say, you know, I really want you to play with my bead. It's not that I care about. You're following me that precisely. It's just that I want to take the element of choice out of the question so that people are not forced to decide, okay, do I follow him or do I not follow him?

Speaker 1:          02:33          There has to be just one current. Of course, mistakes happen, accidents happen. If something goes wrong then you just have to use your sense and that's based on experience. Either you given, sometimes it's better to give in and allow it to sort of write itself over time. Other Times you sort of dig your heels in and you just say, okay, no, this is where it is. And it creates a discomfort, an uncomfortable moment. But, um, you try to use your best sense and, uh, I couldn't say it's a always one way or it's, or it's always another way is you just have to figure out what the best way to get out of those situations. And hopefully they're not too frequent.
