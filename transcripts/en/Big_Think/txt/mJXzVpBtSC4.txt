Speaker 1:          00:04          One of the great things that I, that I love about what I do is we get to take on some of the biggest challenges in global health and global development. And one of those challenges is water, sanitation and hygiene. Um, everybody needs clean water and you know, uh, to quote the book, everybody poops. And, uh, dealing with this in a clean and sanitary way is really important for quality of life and it's also really important for health and getting rid of certain diseases. One of the biggest challenges over the last couple of years, uh, a really fun technological challenges has been the reinvent the toilet project. Uh, the basic theme of this was looking at are there new solutions, 21st century solutions to sanitation, echoing what we saw in a telephone and communication systems where a lot of countries completely skipped over building a, a big network of landlines and traditional phones and went straight to cell phones.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Uh, the question was, could we come up with the equivalent technology that would jump over building out sewer networks in giant water, expensive water treatment plants, and jump immediately to non-network sanitation. And it turns out that new approaches are possible using mechanical engineering and chemical engineering approaches. Uh, there's actually a lot of free energy in the waste that can be used to process itself if, uh, the machine to do it is designed correctly and you can actually do this in a fairly cost effective way. So the reinvent the toilet challenge was kicked off, uh, about five years ago, uh, in order to, uh, get universities, uh, different companies, design firms and so on to actually think about this and put a 21st century innovation applied to the problem of a human sanitation. And it's been remarkably, uh, uh, cool and successful so far to see the different approaches that have come up.

Speaker 1:          02:03          There was one team of a lot of hurts fellows that, uh, started, uh, working on figuring out new ways to do use pyrolysis and other approaches for using electrolysis for drying. And combusting one group is running a steam engine off of, uh, human waste as the input stream and we're a community would use to have, uh, 10 tons of waste the day. Now all of a sudden a, it runs a, a steam engine that generates 150 kilowatts of electricity and puts out 10,000 to 20,000 liters a day of potable water. So this is just really exciting to see what innovation can do, what new technologies can do, and actually, uh, taking on some of these really big challenges in saying what would be a really definitive technological solution to this that actually solves the problem in a way that we would never have imagined trying 25 or 30 years ago.
