Speaker 1:          00:07          Just make sure on global climate that we're talking about more than climate and that you understand what climate means. There's a great argument that global climate change, which has become warmer, has actually been a real positive. We have less people freezing to death even though we have some that are dying and is that where the highest priority for our resources is red or is it fight email? You mail nutrition, malnutrition around the world. Whereas if fighting malaria around the world are HIV aids. If you gave me $200,000,000,000 to go spend over the next 10 years, global climate will be the last place I'd put that money. It would be in the malnutrition. It would be in a malaria, it'd be an HIV aids. That's what we need to decide as a world. It's sort of like giving a new heart to a 90 year old.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Do you give that new heart to a 10 year old or do you give it to 90 year old? You've got to make choices because there are limited resources at the end of the day and if I'm going to end up being taxed for $100,000,000,000 worth of cost is a consuming nation of energy. I want to make sure those taxes go to the best places we can for the world's wealth and health, health and welfare, and I vote for doing that on the side of hunger and disease way before I try to create, try to fight the fiction that I think has been hoisted on us about what CEO is really doing and we have to absolutely educate ourselves just as I'm doing right now about what is really causing the problem. Is it actually he the warmth the globe causing ceo to to rise or is it CO2 causing the the heat of the globe to go up and importantly, if it is going up because of manmade emissions, is it all bad or is it actually arguably somewhat good?

Speaker 1:          01:45          Is the Arctic actually melting because of the wind changes or because of co? Two is the Antarctic actually losing five percent of its ice in one part and growing out of 95 percent more, make sure we get all the points of the story and that we don't have special interest groups lobbying groups, whether it's the oil industry, whether it's the environmental movement or whether it's politicians or other ngos telling us how the world ought to work. Let's get educated all of us on her own and get past the rhetoric and actually make tough, tough economic choices based on where our hurt says the world ought to go.
