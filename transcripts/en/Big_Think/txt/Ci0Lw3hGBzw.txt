Speaker 1:          00:08          No, I don't, I, my grandmother was a terrible cook, uh, and, and my mother died when I was very young and my father was a terrible cook, so I think, you know, uh, they, I overcompensate a little bit like for the cooking end of things. So I don't know why, I don't know what drove me to, to be a chef exactly. But the kind of chef that I've become, I think was, you know, sort of unconsciously inculcated by this connection to the land, especially to like my grandma's sense of responsibility, which was huge. It was like, it was like she, she very much believed in open space and, and in doing everything possible to preserve it. And that meant farming in the case of where Blue Hill wasn't meant to preserve that the pastoral, you literally needed to pasture. Uh, and so, you know, there was a responsibility came attached to the pleasure of the views literally. Um, and I think somehow I have connected that with food and the idea that, you know, have those views and that open space, you've got to eat it. Uh, so, you know, it's, it's, it's chef and it's, you know, it's being a chef and, and providing pleasure by way of a kind of responsibility that's um, yes, that's pleasurable in and of itself.

Speaker 1:          01:27          I graduated and I was a little bit lost on what to do and I went out and I baked bread in California for awhile and kind of cooked on the side, just starting some money and I thought actually maybe I'd write about, I was going to write about a bunch of things, but I ended up just earning extra money by cooking and that led one thing led to another and I, you know, I was always kind of undecided until I think I went to France and then I was really cooking and that was sort of a light went off I think, although it was an Aha moment, you know, it wasn't one of those things I just like, I'm still questioning as we sit here now.

Speaker 2:          02:03          Yeah.
