Speaker 1:          00:03          I had been a journalist for about eight and a half years. I was kind of an accidental journalist. I never really intended to be a journalist side. Uh, was fortunate enough to fall into a job at the New York times when I got out of college. And it was a great experience when you're in your twenties to see the world and meet interesting people and be involved with interesting issues. But as time went on, I said to myself, you know, I never really thought about what I wanted to do with my life. Um, I'd like to see what it's like in effect on the other side of the curtain to see what it's like to actually be the one doing the deals, not just writing about the deals. And so I decided as kind of an experiment to go try it, thinking I would do it for a couple of years and if it didn't work out, if I wasn't any good at it, if I, if I didn't like it, I could come back to journalism and I ended up staying 25 years.

Speaker 1:          00:52          I think journalism today is in a very interesting place. Uh, I wrote in my book about some of my grievances being on, on the other side of the line from the journalist in terms of how I think journalism has changed in the 30 years, roughly since I was in Washington as a journalist, um, where I think it has become much more game of spinning and being spun much more game of. Gotcha. Um, and I think all of that is part of why the tonality in our society is pretty rough at the moment. I think. I don't blame journalists for all of it. Uh, I don't blame the government for all of it, but I think there is a shared responsibility that right now isn't being discharged. Uh, and I think there's been a bit of a dumbing down of journalism. I think the whole sound byte journalism, uh, the blogosphere, the cable, the hyperventilated, cable TV journalism, I'm not sure how great any of that is, but I was just a few minutes ago having a conversation with someone about the other side of the coin, which is you had this enormous pro proliferation of journalistic outlets, like big thing that didn't exist, couldn't exist a few years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And so in the course of trying to sell my book, I've been interviewed by all kinds of media outlets that didn't exist and as I said, couldn't have existed a few years ago and in, in a way that's a kind of golden age of journalism that there are so many more ways now to communicate and learn things. So I certainly wouldn't hesitate to tell a friend or a child to go into journalism, but I think you really have to pick your spots and know what you're in for.

Speaker 1:          02:25          My whole career in finance was going from bigger firms to smaller firms and at each step, step of the way, all I wanted was to be part of a small group of very talented people on every firm. I joined got bigger and so finally I decided, uh, starting our own firm would be the next great thing to do. It was a point in time, this was in the year 2000 when it was relatively easy to start a firm. There was a lot of capital, there were a lot of investors around and there's no, there's no sense of accomplishment like starting a firm or a business as I'm sure you're finding a from scratch and watching it succeed and grow and thrive.

Speaker 1:          03:07          If you want to be an entrepreneur, which is a wonderful thing to aspire to, you have to, there are several things you have to have. First, you have to be completely committed and devoted to that enterprise or project or whenever you take on. It's not something to do in your spare time. It's not something to do while you have a couple of other careers. It's not something to do. While you write your first novel, it's something you've just got to do. The second thing is you've got to have a very strong constitution. There will be bumps in the road, there'll be ups and downs, you, they may well be complete failure. Many entrepreneurial ventures fail. Um, you have to accept that that is part of the game. And failure is not the end of life. It's not the end of the world. Uh, and you just have to be willing to roll with the punches and take risks. You have to basically be a risk taker. Many people spend their entire careers happily in established organizations because they don't have the tolerance for risk. I frankly never thought I would have the tolerance for risk. I've always been part until we started our firm of, uh, of an established large organization. But having been part of now one startup, I think there's nothing else quite like it. If it works, and I could easily imagine doing another.
