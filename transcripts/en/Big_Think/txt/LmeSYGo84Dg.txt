Speaker 1:          00:04          My job, right? Right now, I'm not partisan. So whether Obama was delivering it or not on leave to others or, or my, my private thoughts, um, any

Speaker 2:          00:13          buddy running for president and anybody who serves as president has to do a variety of the same thing, which is to call up the very basic, traditional American ideals and use them to make an argument about our place in the world and about public policy. Uh, certainly Obama has done that a lot and very effectively in this campaign. He places his campaign in this context of American history and of American ideals in our quest to live up to the ideals in a way that all the greatest presidential speeches have done from Lincoln to Roosevelt to, to Reagan. Uh, and that's what you've got to do. And the John Mccain is not as proficient a speaker from a prepared text. He has written books and when he's in a 10 meeting, he could talk the same way and make people really understand how the moment today, uh, meets, meets the moments where the country has been courageous in the past. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:11          For Mccain. You know, the challenge is going to be to step up to him when he has to get the big formal speech.
