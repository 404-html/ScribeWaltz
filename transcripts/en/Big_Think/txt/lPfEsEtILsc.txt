Speaker 1:          00:05          No

Speaker 2:          00:08          latte in the middle of Ohio now you know when Seinfeld was on and everybody loved it, guess what was Jews from New York like this idea that we're so out of touch and that this culture we've come up with here is anathema to the rest of the country. Like guess what? This isn't where we are as well. Real American as everybody else. And sure there are more liberals here, you know? Sure Sir. We're used to a more heterogeneous population in New York City than what I just saw when I was reporting in Maine last week, but there was plenty of Latte and we're not that different and we're not any less American. Well matter of. Sorry about the facts. Sorry. That that big science, which is to say scientists have realized that if we keep doing things the way we're doing them, we are going to end the world. Sorry.

Speaker 2:          01:15          I mean I wish it weren't so like, but it doesn't make it a liberal phenomenon. I mean I used to just beyond my comprehension. The thing I was going to say about the New York Times is you'll notice that as much as the president likes to say it's fake news, the minute he goes in meets with their editors, he says it's a great American treasure, you know, I mean it is the paper of record and now and in fairness, they did make some mistakes. They're humans like all that stuff around the wmds and the and the windup theory I rapport. That is serious stuff that happened that the times got wrong, that eroded public trust, but I don't actually think that's what's going. I don't think that's what this election was about. I mean, we know for fact that it wasn't. We know for a fact that there was a very targeted system for disseminating fake news.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Long form journalism is the only thing I've ever done. Right. That end writing books, you know, I don't know how to be a newspaper journalist. I think what they do is incredibly impressive, but I'm not trained to do it. I don't know how to do it, and they have a different mandate than we do. I mean, their mandate is to attempt objectivity, um, and ours isn't, I mean we are meant to tell the truth and everything you read in the New Yorker has been fact checked more than you can believe. But the overall story I'm telling in any given, no matter what it is, it's always my version and it's not my mandate to be, to be without a perspective. It's not my mandate to, to remove myself, to have the least, uh, present authorial voice. I can't, that's not my mandate. My mandate is to try to make it interesting for the reader while informing the reader, you know, with, with, you know, a complete allegiance to accuracy.

Speaker 2:          03:25          But I'm allowed to tell the story however I want to. And that's the luxury. I mean, that's being a long form. That's being a magazine journalist and that's what I love about it. I'm never, I'm never endeavoring to make myself or my point of view invisible. That's not my mandate. I'm trying to be subtle about it because the, the, the quieter and sort of, you know, the more the, if I'm sly about it, that it's more persuasive because you don't want to feel that someone's directed you to think this, that and the other. You want to feel that, you think that, but it's my job to lead you to think whatever it is I want you to. I mean, just there's, I don't think there's a. It depends, depends, depends how honest the individual journalist is and how much and how much allegiance he or she has to the truth to accuracy, you know, I mean, I am not wed to making every person feel that their perspective has been represented. I'm representing my perspective when I tell a story, but every single detail in that story will be the truth and no little false hood is okay ever. And we take that very seriously.
