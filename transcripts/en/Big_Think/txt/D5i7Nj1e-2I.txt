Speaker 1:          00:11          That wouldn't bother with all the football as well. I bumped in and it's got to be there sort of head, shoulders above anyone else, terms of the way that hearing him as influenced by. And then there's a whole battalion of people, everyone from Nina Simone's talk to Van Morrison know, uh, Nick Drake is a Koan, you know, a Joni Mitchell. It's just a, as a whole sway that people like the specials and the Qr code. I was obsessed with the Kule for ages. I love the smell of them live a couple of times in the midnight sees that would great.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Yeah, it was a couple. Actually. A Walden was the water boys. This is the sea at Cardiff University. Nineteen 85. Uh, they just went straight through the curfew and played for like three hours, but that was such a brilliant record and he was at the peak of his powers. Mike Scott at that point, he'd already written songs like fisherman's blues and things that appeared later and he played them at the show and I remember instantly liking that. I've never heard it before. And he played a couple of things. He played a couple of covers and he just went on and on and on, but the way they will change the instruments that, uh, I, I love that show. And then the same year I went to Glastonbury for the first time and the cure headlined Saturday night, uh, that was the head of the door album, which was a brilliant record, but they just did a brilliant set and it was, and as it used to be, not quite as clean and neat and tidy as it is now, but the pyramid stage, they had a laser, they used to be a laser, the laser, only the headline, I could use it.

Speaker 1:          02:06          So the cure got to use the laser and I was there a bit out of my brains with my little friend from school. Um, unless thunderstorm came into the moon was going down and like the sun was of other movements coming up. The Sun was going down and then there's just this huge storm came in and there was thunder and lightning and all the dry ice was being dragged across the stage. It just looked fantastic and they just played through all the stuff. Yeah, that was. That was amazing. I was blown away by Glastonbury. The whole thing of it. I'm so obsessed by music. I must have seen about 40 bands like the cure was. That was the.
