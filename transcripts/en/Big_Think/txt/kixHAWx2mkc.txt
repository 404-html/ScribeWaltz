Speaker 1:          00:00          Unpassionate about positive thinking from the early books written the power of positive thinking and all the experts in the past. Many of them, I knew them later on in life, met them in different parts of the world, but I, I apply it because if you study any of the writings and the tissues of positive thinking, you have to have a goal in your mind. Otherwise you're thinking blindly. You don't walk in and you don't walk to a destination without having an idea of what you're going, where you're going. So it's positive thinking isn't just thinking to yourself, well, I can do anything I want and so forth because some things we can't do. I, I have some people I know personally. I wish they felt they could float if they walked out of an airplane in the sky. No, I'm not being nasty. I'm just being crazy. But the real positive thinking is having goals because a, a golfer never hits a ball and so he sees where it's going.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Never hits a ball and police sees words. Otherwise it's going. Neither does a picture when he throws a ball. So we have to have in our lives some direction and we have to think with, with the positiveness that we're going to take advantage of all the opportunities that lead to that direction. But the interesting thing is when failures take place and study the lives of famous people, they found alternative routes which often caused them to invent new machinery, new paraphernalia that didn't work when the other thing failed because they had to be resourceful. The same as you are in a war. When you're playing a game in which you're playing against a team and something goes wrong. It's the same. Life is really a game show. You have to, you have to have a flexibility and those things take place. Not only in knowing in your heart and soul, you're going to find a route. You're going to find the root to this place you want to go to, whether it's working in a, in a, uh, a large food complex because you like to cook and what have you and your say food or whether it's working on a sports team or what have you. But you also have to figure, you know, if this thing doesn't happen, maybe there's something in the background there that I didn't notice that I could take advantage of in the same way that sometimes. And let's take a lesson from chefs.

Speaker 1:          02:24          If they don't have a certain piece, a certain appetizer that's, that's there for that food, there's often a couple of other ones that can be edit that turns out, can make it a new chased, a new dessert. And that's the way you have to think about like as a meal at your adding to.
