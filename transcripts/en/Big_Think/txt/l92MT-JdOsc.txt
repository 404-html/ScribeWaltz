Speaker 1:          00:05          You know, we're learning ways to perturb the brain and I'm just wondering, do you think someday that people will be sort of enhancing, kind of quote unquote natural creativity to get people to be more like what we think of as geniuses or is that just not possible? I love the idea of the vision that there's a way to, to, um, to bring out the genius in all of us and I wish that there was a way that in our educational system that we could develop ways to promote creativity. We do actually, we're pretty good at it, but we could be better that we could teach people to take risks in education. We could value more the, um, the, the person that takes the path that is not the common path. I think we as a society are pretty good at that. We can be a lot better and I think that that's one of the values of studying or thinking about genius.

Speaker 1:          01:13          It's a way for us to think about cheap, let's, let's get better at this creative business. Let's, let's find that creative spirit in all of us. Let's move forward faster. I think sometimes people think about the brain has kind of a shortcut to all these sorts of problems, you know, if we just understand the brain, then we can just go right in there and just fix things directly. Whereas it is easy to forget that, you know, education itself is altered to the brain. Exactly. I think that we have to think about brains in the context of our society. I'm in. One of the things about genius, I think it's not just an individual or just to brain, it's about opportunity. It's about somebody who is given the pathway to actually make a contribution. It's think of our art musicians, most of us would consider geniuses.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Bach, Beethoven, Mozart. These are people that, um, were put in positions that allow them to be creative. The creative spirit comes with many things other than just the brain. I think it comes with opportunity. It comes with resources, with attitude. Again, I like the idea of not thinking of it as something that the targets and individual and separates them, but something that joins us together as a quality that belongs to all of us. Well, because it is true that when people talk about genius as they are other, they're there, they're almost freakish. Exactly. And I think that that attitude really deters people from taking the risk, but it's a double edge sword. The genius term is often associated with a person that really changes the way we think it could fit with something that didn't exist before, that changes the course of our progress in some fundamental way. So that person by his or her nature stands out and is different. And yet, and yet all of us are different in our creative sphere. And that by incorporating the creative person into the mainstream, um, it might be a way to encourage more creativity

Speaker 2:          03:36          in a way. Uh, you know, you've been talking a lot about the things that neuroscientists can't tell us about genius, want easy answers and, and we think, oh, these answers are on the brain and, and you're kind of warning us like, well, we, neuroscientists suite, we don't know all that much. The brain is a complicated thing and it's, it's a social thing too. So, I mean, what do you think that neuroscientists can do to help us understand genius better? I mean, what, what are the kinds of studies that you think would be like the best ones to do to make us understand genius as, as you think of it?

Speaker 1:          04:13          I think that in general, the study of individual differences, um, is a really interesting direction to take differences in. Say there's some people that have extraordinary memory and we can design experiments to look at the neural circuitry that's associated with memory strategies and we learned something about what makes one person better at memorizing things than another. There are differences in um, how, how well we do mathematics and how well we can put things together and understanding the rules for those differences is important. For example, one of the things that neuroscientists have taught us recently is that the parts of the brain are all so richly interconnected and the extent to which they are connected has a great deal to do with function.

Speaker 2:          05:19          So we're talking about say a patch of cortex over here and another patch over here and there like cables. Joining them together.

Speaker 1:          05:30          Indeed, and how well those connections actually work, um, is thought to contribute a great deal to our individual differences.

Speaker 2:          05:39          Is it that some people have more connections than others or bigger connections or what's what, what are those underlying differences?

Speaker 1:          05:47          Well, it's all of the above. In some cases the connections are actually more richly innervated. There are simply more of them in other cases they to slightly different places. Um, in other cases they're just stronger connections, which means there's less noise in the brain. All of those hypotheses are, are viable options as evidence for all of them and they contribute to, um, considerable differences between performances or one person or another.

Speaker 2:          06:22          So if we start to get down to these, you know, real kind of biological components of creativity, of innovation and of, you know, ultimately what we might call genius. I'm wondering how can we start to kind of figure out like are geniuses just born or are they made or what can we figure can even figure out what the differences are? You know, was, was Einstein just a blank slate when he was born and he just happened to have a really good math teacher in first grade. I mean, what, you know, how, how do those connections, what do we know about how those connections develop, uh, in, in children and teenagers and adults and you know, how the genes play a role in all that.

Speaker 1:          07:08          That really is the $64,000 question and it is the question that we would like to answer. How does the brain do it and how do we help the brain do it better? I think that your question really raises another really important point and that is how much bigger are questions are than our science, our methodology. We need a genius to figure this one out because we need to be able to answer those kinds of questions faster to answer them better and we need to apply them to our lives.
