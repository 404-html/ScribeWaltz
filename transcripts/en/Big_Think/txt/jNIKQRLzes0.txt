Speaker 1:          00:11          I think that that human kind has been a history of boots, a powerful people stamping on people's faces. I think that's history and there's different size boots and different brands and colors and inside that's basically history than the enlightenment comes along and they. Enlightenment says, and you know, it's it. It's interesting if you read somebody like Machiavelli, uh, who's, whose thoughts about Machiavelli, but it even have to understand that when they use the word freedom, they use it differently than we do. For them a, a, a state was free in the sense of it was not a vassal state, that prince was not a vassal to some greater empire. That's what freedom meant. It was just taken for granted over there, and of course the people existed as instruments of the leaders end. And then this great watershed moment in humanity is the enlightenment, especially the Scottish enlightenment where people started realizing, wait, we have our own ends.

Speaker 1:          01:13          We exist as ends in ourselves, and the state is just this compact we form so we can pursue our own ends. Now, of course, they control freaks among us, hated that and fought the enlightenment. Then when they couldn't defeat it, they subverted it, and that's the French enlightenment. That's Russo and they couldn't actually stop the progress of the enlightenment. So what they did was they cheapen it and they said, well, yes, you're right. This individual freedom is important, but we have to understand that individual freedom. It isn't the silly Scottish English sense of a man deciding his own ends. It's really this deeper sense of subjugating yourself to the right historical mission. So you get Russo with his love orientation around the will of the general will, which maybe isn't. It doesn't mean the majority of will. It's maybe something that only one person knows. And when this robespierre forces you to submit to him, he's forcing you to be free.

Speaker 1:          02:11          And Russo is phrased. And then that goes on through Hegel Marx, where the, uh, you know, it's the trying for the proletariat and it's Lennon words that vanguard of the proletariat, the party Hitler, where it's the, the, the folk. It's the, the prerogative of the people in your real freedom is frowned and subordinate yourself to the work of the people are bike Mark Phi, as they said, over the concentration camp gates and somewhere along the way, the intellectuals from the continent, I think lost the sense of no freedom is this basic idea of people choosing their own ends in life. And it's not, it's, it's, uh, it's, uh, when I listened to people talk in politics, I go right back to this route and it's pretty easy to say for most of them, they've just taken the wrong fork. They are in one way or another, defining liberty and freedom as subordinating yourself to the ends that they, that someone else has chosen for you and that that's a value less.

Speaker 1:          03:13          That is to me the main contention in the world of ideas and political thought. Somebody get that freedom has to be a self, a defined process and pursuit. Or is it, are they all debating freedom as well? We take it for granted that we get to subordinate individuals to our ends and now we're just going to debate the answer. That's, that's where most people are. That's where most of the world is, and I think that's a really pernicious concept. In fact, voltaire read a book by Rousseau where he was, when he read the stuff, he's, he wrote us a letter where he said, dear Mr, so I've had the pleasure of reading your book against the human race. Well had it exactly right. This is this philosophy, this continental philosophy from Rousseau, Kant, Hegel, a niche, uh, a Marx. Lenin, of course, it's, it's anti freedom. It's philosophy against the human race.
