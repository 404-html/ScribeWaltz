Speaker 1:          00:10          What we're leaving,

Speaker 2:          00:13          uh, 10 15, 20 years from now. You remind me of that. All of the joke and the philosophy class where the professor asks the students, which is worse ignorance, ignorance or apathy and some poor kid from the back of the class says, I don't know and I don't care. Well, I think it's an interesting question. Is there an exciting way that we could get the young people to this country aware and their parents? Because I refuse to believe that parents have suddenly become cold and indifferent to their own kids and grandkids. Parents, I think they've been deceived and a misinformed and [inaudible] and so forth. So we have a political system today, for example, where the elderly are unbelievably well represented. The American Association of Retired Persons as 38 dues paying member, 38 million dues paying members. They write more, they lobby Mar, they call more. And by and large, it's not too unfair to say a lot of their programs are.

Speaker 2:          01:30          We want more, even though by any reasonable standard, as I say, some of these challenges are unsustainable. We can't, we're not going to be able to meet the promises that we've made. So on the one hand, we have these, this culture of our ethic of shared sacrifice, being kind of a dirty word, not wanting to give up anything. We have political organizations who are dominant in representing one age group and the young people who are all about the future or somehow being slipped. This huge check, hidden check I might add for our free lunch and nobody seems to be doing anything about it.
