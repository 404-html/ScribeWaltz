Speaker 2:          00:20          I'm Alice Rivlin and I'm a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. I think we're in a positive the innovation cycle, which is definitely not over. Uh, there are lots of things happening in new electronic, uh, applications in new, uh, healthcare applications. Uh, and, uh, that's going to power our economy going forward and is not a moment at which I think anyone can say. We've run out of ideas at the moment. We've run out of credit now. We are, uh, a financing, uh, people's new ideas. But, uh, we need to turn that around. There are certainly risks of not investing in technology. There are bigger risks of investing in the wrong technology. Uh, the landscape is littered with corporations and government agencies, uh, that a revamped their computer systems, uh, uh, quickly and, uh, uh, caused more chaos than the advantage of investing in new technology. So the bottom line is got to do it very carefully and have some very skilled people doing it.

Speaker 2:          01:47          Computers and telecommunications have revolutionized our, uh, the way we conduct business and the way we conduct our lives. Um, the, uh, problems are that we're overwhelmed with too much information and too much noise going on. I think the, uh, the real problem of surviving these a wonderful innovations is, uh, uh, to, uh, keep a bit centered to this matters for business. It matters for ordinary people, uh, and, uh, not get overwhelmed and distracted by the rapidity and the volume of the information flow. Technology is helping the government a lot and could help more basically, a lot of things go more smoothly. The government is involved in huge information collection, uh, operations. Uh, it essentially runs a huge insurance companies, uh, called social security. A lot of information needs to be collected and processed, uh, quickly. Uh, that's a certainly a change the way the government operates.

Speaker 2:          03:03          One of the agencies that has had most a benefit, but also most trouble in getting into the modern computer age, uh, is the internal revenue service. Uh, taxes are certainly processed more quickly and efficiently than they used to be. But there's a long way to go, uh, in improving, uh, those, uh, computer systems that, uh, technology has also, uh, given, uh, average people more access to government information and, um, uh, and help. Uh, you can go on lots of websites and find out what's available to help your particular business or help you, uh, as a, uh, a taxpayer on a particular, uh, problem. Um, there's a long way to go. Uh, but both the federal government and state and local governments are a much more effective than they used to be because they have taken advantage of modern technology. Most major government agencies have a chief technology officer and ought to have a most states and cities, uh, do as well. Um, they, uh, uh, clearly technology is extremely important to the functioning of any large organization, whether it's a corporation or a government agency, and somebody very highly qualified has to be
