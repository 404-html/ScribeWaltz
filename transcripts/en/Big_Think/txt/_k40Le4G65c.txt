Speaker 1:          00:10          Oh, yours are that we will not get our, uh, uh, environment under control. The barriers are that, uh, uh, I saw a very interesting film, a few, it was on a French television program. It would be showing, some people come up, uh, from, uh, uh, they had been nomads in the south, uh, part of the desert in western Africa. And there was a fishing season and they arrived in trucks and they, thousands of them went out and we were catching these fish. And pretty soon there were no fish left. That was the point of the film. And the real point of the film is, well, there aren't gonna be any fish lab. But the message was, what are they supposed to do? What are they supposed to do?

Speaker 1:          01:01          Well, this is a huge problem and we know that on the one hand, we've got to keep the fish and we also have to find work for the paper. And so that's the kind of problem that's posed. Tremendous environmental problems, tremendous population problems, uh, tremendous problems, of course, of keeping the, what I'd call the fanatical, dark element of human nature under control. And it only takes a few where it's out of control to do tremendous damage. But we have terrific instruments of cooperation. The Internet being one, our educational institutions, uh, our economy is good. We have this economic means, so forces of points of light and possibilities of,
