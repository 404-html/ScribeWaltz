Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, I think fashion has gotten to a point where it's sort of like mini Hollywood, you know, it's, it's, it's actress light. Uh, it's, it's mellow drama, small. It's a, you know, it's a sitcom. It's not the full length feature movie. It's fashioned, provides a certain drama. It's got the ego, it's got the beauty, it's got the glamor that Hollywood has. Um, and because it's not, know we can't get in behind Meryl Streep's dressing room. We can't get backstage at the filming of that. We can't see when camera, um, uh, who was just on, um, Charlie just did a nude scene and they did it at night and 4:00 in the morning because they didn't want anyone to know and only the director and Charlene's new and Duh, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. Um, uh, we can't get behind the scenes on that. You can't do that. The celebs won't let you do that. Hollywood won't allow us. So, you know, fashion sort of Hollywood light on some level and you can get into a bit of the drama and the Glamor and the beauty that Hollywood provides. Um, and there's also, you know, a lot of Ecos, so you get it, you get a little bit of the, uh, you a little bit of the storyline as well.

Speaker 1:          01:13          They've got to look great and that's their image. And similarly, you know, John Galleano made it out of the, you know, the slight obscurity when, you know, his dresses were worn by, you know, actresses on the catwalk, uh, on the red carpet. I mean, um, so, you know, it's a great symbiotic relationship. Actresses need to look glamorous, they need to be photographed and similarly, designers want to keep their street cred with the general public who's watching the Oscars, who's watching all these celebs, reading all the weeklies, looking at all of the online sites to see what they're wearing when they go out, when they go to award ceremonies. So, you know, the Hollywood end fashion has gotten into bed together. Um, and it's working nicely actually for both of them.

Speaker 1:          01:57          I'm always riveted by Madonna, you know, she continues to more, even at age 50, 51. Uh, she was backstage at Marc Jacobs. He had address, you know, slightly speechless because I think she's got great style. Um, and if not, she's got unbelievable balls to have the style that she wants to have when she wants to have it. So I think she's someone that I've always found to be interesting. Um, I think occasionally Katie Holmes has had great personal style, is kind of gracious in the way she gets dressed. Uma Thurman was a model. I love her style all the time. She looks just great in clothes. Um, you know, beyonce is sexy and beautiful and route and I love the way she looks too. I'm very, very different. Yeah, well, I think of a generation. The blogs are, um, I'd like to consider ours the cut, which is, you know, going through the roof and it's record breaking numbers, um, during New York fashion week last week that people are coming more to the blogs and good smart ones that have a point of view that tell them the news that synthesize it also a bit of a, you know, cutting edge, shall we say, not to, to, to use the part of cut.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Uh, uh, I think that's a generational change that, that really is happening. I don't think the celebrities are in general, um, you know, I think the Olson's have great style and that's an exception to the rule. Um, and they're also doing a great line of clothing, kind of cool classics called the row. Um, but in general, no, I think it comes from the designers. They're the ones that set the trends. They're the ones that create the desire, create the passion, create the whole aura around what you want to get or where or see in any given season. Um, and fashioned traditionally goes from, you know, you're too young, you know, last fall, this fall it was about eighties and leather and tight and sequence and shoulders on belts or forties and more conservative version of that same silhouette. And for spring so far it's very romantic. It's quite loose normous amount of texture to fabrics and ruffles or pearls or rushing or bright strong color things that are very eye-popping. So again, you're seeing the antithesis of what came before. Um, fashion designers tend to be tired of what they've just seen for six months and they want something completely different and fresh. So if you, if you, if you see a season of black, you can bet that the next season's going to be white. If you see a season where it's short and tight, you can sort of put your money on, it might be long and lives um, or looser and slightly more poetic and it's point of view.

Speaker 1:          04:29          I, I think the designer today that really designs for women, um, that's leading the pack on that. With that in mind, um, is Alvera Barabbas for law va. I think his ability to design his technique, his technique, his, his, his literal ability to design a dress and know how to technically do that is um, got many peers. I think Alabama really understands a woman. I think he understands not only her body, but her psyche, how she wants to be alluring, how she wants to feel. Um, I think he's really entered into that space and I therefore, I think he designs with that in mind along with an unbelievable technical ability to make perfectly beautiful clothing, um, seem effortless and have a great ease and sensuality that's very, very, very accomplished and very difficult to come by. So I would have to give my stars to the man with the most style or ability to create that style. Ultimately, a woman's got to have that style because she's putting on something that somebody made. And I think, I think alvero elbaz would be my vote for today.
