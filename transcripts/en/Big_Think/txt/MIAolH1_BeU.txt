Speaker 1:          00:04          So some identities

Speaker 2:          00:07          are those philosophies would say determined it simple determinable, so somewhere like race, uh, in principle, uh, you know, the racial system is laid out so that you have to be of either a mixed race or one of the races and you can't be, as it were, black and an Asian at the same time. You can be mixed race, but you can't be straightforwardly Asian and straightforward, be black at the same time. Uh, so in that sense that mutual exclusivity is built into the structure of some kinds of identity, but there's nothing in general about identities that excludes the overlap of different forms of identity, of gender and race and sexual orientation, religion and nationality in class or in a single person that indeed most people have all of these things. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:54          why?

Speaker 2:          00:56          Well, what's a sensible thought about how to deal with them? Well, first of all, and this relates to what the proper answer to the question, and, uh, what's your identity is usually in a context, it's pretty clear which aspects of your identity, other ones that are relevant. If I'm at a meeting of the American Philosophical Association, um, my, my identity as a philosopher is kind of important, but if I go to a meeting, uh, of, uh, of, uh, uh, you know, a church group, it probably isn't. And so I know, uh, I know without thinking about it, uh, often what the relevance is of different dimensions of my identity. So when people get into trouble with us is because they think that one dimension of identity makes a demand on them that's inconsistent with the demand made by some other dimension of their ideas. I think there are sort of two

Speaker 2:          01:54          helpful guiding thoughts. One is, um, morality is helpful here. That is to say there are general obligations. We have two other people independent of their identities and our identities. We better make sure that we discharged those. First of all. So if you find yourself being pulled into dementia directions by your identities, if you find yourself being pulled in one direction, say as a Serb and in the other direction as a Christian, it might be helpful to remember that you're a human being and that you have obligations to other people, uh, that are not connected with whether you're being with your Serb or Christian. So I, that's one thing. Morality helps morality, which, which defines what we owed to everybody, irrespective of their identities. At the second thing is that sometimes we do have to make choices. That's part of what it is to make human life.

Speaker 2:          02:43          It's the, it's the way in the balance. Am I going to go here with my religious identity or am I going to go here with my racial identity in this particular context? Or am I going to try and find some way here? The two unthought of to bring them together without that strong tension and people are doing this all the time. It can sound very difficult in theory, but I know my model for this really was my father. My father wasn't a santee and a and a patriot of the Santee, a Ghanaian and a patriot of Ghana. Uh, he wrote an autobiography called the autobiography of an African Patriot because he was a Pan Africanist. Um, he was a devout methodist and very active in his church and cared about his church and he was a citizen of the world. He was ambassador to the UN for awhile and he worked very much an international affairs.

Speaker 2:          03:33          He cared about relations among nations. Now you might think, how can you be a loyal Isanti and a loyal Ghanaian after all the Santa is a kingdom in the middle of the Republic of Ghana? Well, the answer is, you know, look at my father's life as it were. And look at lots of lives. People do this sort of thing all the time. You can be a loyal citizen of Texas and a loyal American. Occasionally they'll pull you in different directions and then you have a choice to make, but much of the time, you know, being Texas texts and there's got to be what matters for some purposes. And being American is what matters for others. And when they do come into conflict, you have many things to appeal to to help you resolve the conflict, including, I think your own sense of the relative weight in your own life, which is up to you of your state identity as opposed to your national identity. So you can't tell people you can't. These are things that have people have to figure out for themselves. Um, because there is no morally correct, uncertain though, ethically pre given answer to the question, what's more important, tax and or American, what's more important, um, uh, in a Christian or philosopher, these things are not. You have to figure it out for yourself. I think all you can say to people in trying to be helpful is that

Speaker 4:          04:53          I'm a,

Speaker 2:          04:55          you're often going to have people who share one of these identities with you, make demands of you on that basis that you're entitled to resist in the name of your more of morality and the, and the name of a human human identity, but also in the name of other identities that you have and what you don't share with them. Everybody, if you just, um, I worked at the other day that you really need to have 32 properties, uh, to consider any 32 properties to elect to have a set of bundles of properties such as everybody in the world can have a distinct and unique bundle. The bundle the properties because two to the 32 is bigger than 6 billion or 6 billion of us.

Speaker 4:          05:37          Well, I'm a.

Speaker 2:          05:41          So even in the smallest village, right? There are both men and women, so all the other identities are inflect, are potentially inflected by gender and among the women, some have more resources than others. Some are married and some are married, some have children don't have children. All of these affect how their lives looked at them and how they get to make the balance of these things in their lives and the sort of the key thought of the liberal tradition. It goes back to comp, goes back to Humboldt, goes back to liberal, slight mill. In the 19th century, the key thought is each human being has to challenge face the challenge of making this decision for herself. You can take advice from other people, you shouldn't take advice from other people, other people can tell you useful things, but it's your responsibility in the end to make a decision and you shouldn't differ that responsibility to anyone else.
