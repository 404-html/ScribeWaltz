Speaker 1:          00:00          No,

Speaker 2:          00:07          Nah,

Speaker 1:          00:09          not really. I mean, it's funny. I, I, I, I don't, again, maybe because I don't think about, I don't think about it enough. Um, it's funny because I now live in New Jersey and, uh, I, you know, I've just start, I've just moved out there and I'm experimenting with, with, with the great commute. And so I'm taking a train from the outer still somewhat pastoral suburbs into Manhattan and on that train ride, um, between the towns of [inaudible] and far hills, I was looking out the window the other day and I looked out the window and they're on the tops of this abandoned line of telephone poles that were in between the fields and, and the kind of no man's land of the track on these abandoned telephone poles, which dated to probably around 1900 where these gorgeous turquoise and jade green colored glass insulators on the Poles. And these were what they used to, you know, protect the wiring.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Now these glass insulators stopped being used in 1915, 1920 being actively made and they switched into more one more modern materials to protect these. And I looked at this absolute, you know, almost, you know, it predates the machine age. I looked at this glass, these glass insulators, and I have, I've been collecting them for years. So to see them out the window still in c two as they would say, I'm still in their original, you know, moment was, was just so gratifying. And so it was like the, it was like the best moment of the week for me because although part of me wants to now go out there and climb up the telephone poles and like try and extract them because I'm like, well, no one's using them. This is just, it's no different than hunting for old bottles.

Speaker 1:          02:17          I could be arrested, but you know, I've got to check with the local Amtrak police there. But I think the thing is, is that if you look at those insulators on those poles, and you see how folks designed something truly beautiful to protect the technology of the time, there was this glass case that went over the ones and it was a very about the function because they had to keep the water out to stop the, uh, the wires from corroding. But these are gorgeous. And I know folks out there who have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of different examples of these glass, you know, glass pieces. And so seeing something like that, an artifact from the early era, seeing that out in that kind of, you know, I love looking at a train because we're always looking at people's backyards. And when you look out there and you see these, these, these ornaments that served a function made me think about design again in a fresh way. But maybe it made me want to just go out and get them.

Speaker 2:          03:13          Oh, I don't know. That's my style.
