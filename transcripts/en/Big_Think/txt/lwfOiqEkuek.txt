Speaker 1:          00:09          It's different every time. And if that years ago there wasn't, I did do something like that at a, for a magazine. Uh, we're, we're a journalist's x who followed me around and we tried to, but, but, um, it's, it's slightly different every time. My inspiration comes from everywhere, uh, just walking down the street just, and I never know where it's going to come from. So I keep a notebook with me at all times. Um, and the only criteria for anything making it into that notebook is if it stops me in my tracks for even an instant. If it catches my eye or my ear, you know, and, and I just write it down. That means there's, there are recipes in there, you know, there are words and sometimes there's a character description or sometimes it's a line. And after that point though, what happens is kind of odd.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Um, I tend to, I work in fragments in the sense that I'm not going to sit down and say, first line is this, and now I'm going to just write my way through it. I let the poem, it's like piecing it together like a pot. So I'll, I'll might have a line that I might write down on the middle of a page and I still write things down with a pen on paper. I go to the computer when, when it gets too messy and use it like an elaborate typewriter because I printed out and then I messed it up again. But when I do get down, sit down to write in my room, in my study and I tried to write there at a certain time, every night I'm a night person, my best times or midnight to six actually. Um, I'll leave through my notebooks and if something catches my eye and I feel like I want to transfer it from the notebook to the page I do.

Speaker 1:          01:58          And then comes this very strange process, which is difficult to describe and that I write until I get stuck or I can't go any further, I'm boring myself or whatever. And then I might go to another poem. Uh, I might go to another folder where there are other drafts of poems in various stages of completion. And the only way I have for keeping track of all this fragment tarry stuff is by color. And I have different colored folders, red folders, blue, yellow. So I might go into my study, let's say one evening and say I feel like the blue folder today and not pick up the blue folder and see what's in there. So it's something that I've kind of worked at over the years, but the colors are only because I didn't want to put anything. I didn't want to file anything in a, in a straight.

Speaker 1:          02:54          Um, I think if you put something in a file that says war poems or loved pumps, but you already restrict the way in which the poem might move. If I put it in blue, it could be sad blue, it could be happy blue, it can be peaceful blue. But my mood at the moment when I'm about to work on that poem once will tell me where I want to go. So it's an odd process, but I do do lots of revisions and I love to revise. Um, so 30 40 revisions is not unusual at this stage. Uh, I do most of my revisions by myself until I reach a point where I either need to give it lots of time because time is a great reviser too. You know, months of, of putting it aside or I will show it. A lot of times I'll show it to my, my husband who is a novelist and as a prose writer, he has a totally different take on things.

Speaker 1:          03:58          So he comes at it a different way. Um, I yearn for those old days, you know, both from graduate school, right? You go into a workshop and people would give you all these ideas and you take it away from me. But at this point, um, that just doesn't, it's not in the card. So I think it's both. I think that that you certainly don't have to be aged and you know, and, and travel the world to write a poem. In fact, sometimes traveling the world is, is, is a way of not writing a poem, but it's the quality of experiences being able to, to experience something. And when you begin to write about it, be able to apply the tools that you need for writing, you know, a mastery of the language in a way of, of, of, of, of piecing together the language I guess, uh, that those two factors have to come together.

Speaker 1:          05:01          So you do need to be to work at it, but you also have to be able to know when to, when to take the experience as it happened, went to tweak it a little bit. What part of the experience is going to move somebody else. And what part is really your own? Um, private moment. So I've, I've seen pumps written by very young people, which are absolutely stunning. And of course we have examples, look bored layer and you know, when it was in his teens, and these are amazing poem. So he obviously didn't have a wealth of experience or age or anything like that. And I've seen poems, which of course could only have been written by someone who was older and had lived certain, you know, stages of life. I've gone through certain stages of life, but it's a combination of the two. It really is. You know,

Speaker 2:          05:59          I, I've always felt that, that the poems I've written, which have historical context, um, are hopefully not just simply plucking something out of history and saying, Ooh, great, let's write about that in every case. What has happened is that I've become fascinated or haunted by something and couldn't shake it as an African American, as a woman, I think that I've been sensitized to the way in which history, uh, privileges of white male and the way in which certain aspects of history, the things that we are taught in school, the things that are handed down, never, never entered the picture that they might've been very important. And you want can tell you that, uh, at the risk of over simplification, let me say that anyone can tell you that, that, that how you're raised as a child has a great deal to do with how you behave as an adult.

Speaker 2:          07:01          And uh, whether you have complexes or whether you need to prove yourself or all kinds of stuff. And yet the mother in a traditional family who has raised a chuck never makes it in the history books. I mean, so, so those kinds of things have always irritated me, let's put it that way. And, um, and I'm always reminded when I, when I see someone, you know, Napoleon's stocks through the battlefields, and I think, yeah, but how did he get that way? You know, how this guy become who he was. So that's, that's the predisposition I had. I think us as a writer, as a person, um, who wanted to create a poetry, that's one of the things that has always been one of my, um, the things I carry along with me each time is different. For instance, in this new book, which is, uh, tells the story of, uh, of, uh, black, uh, mixed race violin is George Bridge Tower who grew up in 18th and 19th century Europe.

Speaker 2:          08:07          I came upon him because I was watching a movie, immortal, beloved. And there was a scene which Beethoven walks by group of musicians and there's this black violin. And so I'm like, what I've heard of Colin's like casting this is a bit strange. And so I looked him up and the, I didn't intend to write poems about it. Um, I just wanted to know more about him and I kept reading in the more red, the more I realized the only way I was going to get him out of my head was to get into his and start writing by him. So in each case, it's, it's been something like that. Um.
