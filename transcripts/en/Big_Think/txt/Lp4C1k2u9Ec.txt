Speaker 1:          00:03          You know, I mean, the movies like Gandhi inspired me and chariots of fire, uh, Mr Smith goes to Washington by Jimmy Stewart was a great inspirational movie about politics. It had a tremendous impact on it, but movies like the Godfather series inspire me. I think the godfather one and two are two of the greatest movies that probably have ever been produced in terms of total thing.
