Speaker 1:          00:00          Right,

Speaker 2:          00:09          well, I, I think that all of us who in some way or Anglo Saxon a half to realize that there are other ideas around, um, and that they can be added to our own thinking and vocabulary and that we have to be open minded towards others. Now, that doesn't mean that we give up cultural basic assumptions such as human rights, such as the rights of women and children because some of these basic assumptions in our societies we must not give up and we have to continue, I think arguing and, uh, illustrating how they benefit society when you pursue them. But that doesn't mean that you cannot collaborate with countries far away, uh, which are inspired by a global community that is all the time learning from each other, from different corners of the world. And we don't have to give up our identity even if we open up to other cultures and other assumptions.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Well, I think the basic thing we identified was that in the 19 eighties we had come so far in seeing the dramatic and emerging trends of the planet being affected by our human activities that we, for the first time in human history, we realized that we are not only responsible for each other, those who are living today, but that we are responsible to take care of the opportunities for future generations. That was the basic, I think, content of that observation and about the concept of sustainable development that we need to also considered the future of coming generations, you know, in the 5,100 years ago, people south about future generations with regard to their own son or daughter taking over the farm, but they didn't have to sync a in terms of the global, uh, aspects of our footprints with undermine the future choices of generations. Unborn. That's, I think is the basic part of that concept.
