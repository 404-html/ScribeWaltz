Speaker 1:          00:08          I think that, um, it's more of a great philosophy that you have a Moira, you have a lot in life, and aristotle taught us that you take your Moyer, you kind of realize where it is. Can you try to fill it up as much as you can? Aristotle also taught a very good lesson that people like naturally there's something inherent in human beings about wanting to perfect whatever you do, you need tries to understand why this is. But yeah, it doesn't get added. But he says it's clear. People like to perfect what they do. Then the second is far more even more insightful. And that is people like to perfect complicated subjects more than easy subjects. So in a very simple analogy, no one becomes a fanatic on checkers. I've never seen somebody say, oh my God, I love checkers. I just think of checkers all the time.

Speaker 1:          01:04          It's a simple game. Uh, but chess, you find lots of fanatics in chess, their whole life revolves around chest. Why? Because just as complicated and so they to perfect, it takes a lot of effort. So I think that there is a great attraction to taking something hard like Shakespeare or like understanding the arts and try to perfect that rather than takes up the simple and perfecting that. That's why a musicians are so stretched because, uh, you know, it's very hard to be a very good mood. Just anybody in the arts is stress a lot. Stretch a lot because it's complicated and that's, aristotle would tell you that's what makes it so much fun and it makes it very frustrating because a, there's not much margin for error there.
