Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Oh, what did I haven't read any papers for at least a month.

Speaker 3:          00:15          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:16          Oh, that's at once. Two things. One of the dumbest moves I've ever heard of being made by a network. And also it's what I knew what I first heard about it when back when they were telling Jay, although your ratings are great, we don't need you to forever so you know, a wonderful way to treat the psyche of the performer, which is one thing that we're people never have a clue about.

Speaker 3:          00:45          Um,

Speaker 2:          00:47          and I knew when I first heard it, this is never going to work. I don't know how exactly. I don't pretend to know who I. 10:00 proved to be such an awful time for a talk show, but it is the psychology of that much later when the show's on and people have had a drink or two and are about to go to bed and want some entertainment before nodding off is very different from how you feel at 10:00 when you could see law and order another such shows and, and it just a natural institute over to the mess Jay inherited. And that Conan was, Wa interestingly pointed out that, that, uh, that, that hijack offer, they offered him that cynical thing that no one in his right mind would accept to get rid of him.

Speaker 3:          01:45          Um,

Speaker 2:          01:47          when you said that you can have the tonight show at 12. Oh, five. Well, somebody including code and pointed out that 12, oh, five is no longer tonight. It's tomorrow. So it would have to be called the early, early show, but anything but the tonight show, any managed, I think to damage to make somewhat damaged goods of both artists involved. And they also succeeded in making their enemy, David Letterman and vcs competition more successful in evart. So whoever is responsible for this boneheaded move, we'll, as we know from watching these things, certainly within a week or to be promoted and given a big raise.
