Speaker 1:          00:08          Korea, Brown cofounder, big thing. I originally from Toronto and I actually don't think that it shaped me too much. I think my parents shaped me more than where I'm from. My parents are, uh, one is our Schwann is American. And so we were always, none of us were Canadians growing up in Canada. And so we always were a little bit of outsiders and so we kind of have that mentality I think.

Speaker 2:          00:41          No,

Speaker 1:          00:43          sure. My, my family is pretty creative and both my siblings are actors and my sister is also a writer, so it's kind of been in the blood and I knew I wanted to do it from, you know, a long time. It was just a question of having the courage to kind of go and move to La and start as an unpaid intern and a waitress and that type of thing. So, um, I mean I, I've just kind of known that I wanted to do it. I can't think of as precise event that's told me this is what you will do that,

Speaker 2:          01:19          um, well, you know, what

Speaker 1:          01:22          it did was sort of not about business. I wanted to do something entrepreneurial. And I had wanted to work in the entertainment and media field. And so after I graduated from university, I moved to France for a year. And while I was there I decided, you know, I'm really interested in film and Television and that type of thing. So I moved back to Toronto very briefly before moving to Los Angeles to work in film. And so while I was there, I thought, you know, I don't really want one to work my way up the studio system. I'd actually like to be running things and creating things and having creative say and what I'm doing. And so I realized that all too often, creative people don't really understand that what they're doing is also a business. And so they kind of need to be trained in that way to operate on the same level as the business people. And so I figured I better get some training in business and so went to business school. But it wasn't because I really wanted to be a business person, it's just that I wanted to understand what business people did so that I could participate.

Speaker 3:          02:36          Okay.
