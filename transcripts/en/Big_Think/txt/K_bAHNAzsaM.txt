Speaker 1:          00:05          Let's talk about a particularly provocative set of experience that meredith chippers has done is this fascinating Canadian researcher I've spent so much time with, so several years ago when I first got interested in her work and I kind of stumbled into her lab. I was working on a different unrelated project at the time when I stumbled into her lab. I've found her showing an array of pornography, so men with women, women with women, men alone, women alone, and even bonobos having sex to self identified straight women, gay women, straight men, gay men, and measuring both their physical response that is vaginal or response in terms of erection for men and then they're subjective response via keypad. How turned on do I say I am? And finding something fascinating which was that wears male response was pretty predictable. The straight men actually did mostly just get turned on to men with women or women with women.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Gay Men equally predictable. The women were very unpredictable and kind of anarchic in at least their physical response. So again, there was this big dichotomy. The women were saying, I'm turned on by what I quote should be turned on by straight women, by men with women or to a certain degree, I suppose men with men and gay women by images of women, et Cetera, but their bodies were saying something completely different and their bodies were saying they were turned on by all of it and perhaps most strikingly you might think those bonobos having sex, but at least you know, reach something animalistic in men. Know the men showed zero response subjectively or physically, but the women did show this physical response to the image of Bonobos having sex. So a lot of interesting things about this, probably too many to name, but one for sure is that the idea of women's sexuality as somehow more controlled needs to be put aside.

Speaker 1:          02:29          If we're going to do any serious searching about arrows and women and to this idea that women are somehow less than visual, less immediate in their sexuality than men. Again, need to put that aside. If we're going to do any serious looking at truths about women's sexuality, now here's a bit of later shivers research that both goes along with but also pulls us in a slightly different direction than that original set of studies. So remember, part of the original set of studies shows women being quite a narcotic and what they're drawn to. She Evers decides, okay, let me take a set of straight women self declared straight women and show them just for types of photographs and see what happens for types of pornographic photographs. So we've got a full lasted and these are kind of December bodied, a genital shots just so we have nothing to distract us. Not a pretty phased out, a handsome face, et cetera. So we've got a dangling flacid penis. We've got an erect penis, we've got to kind of coy, soft porn, female crotch shot legs together. And then we've got a uh, legs spread, more hardcore shot. So the straight women do respond to all of it physically. But that erect penis sends the plethysmograph the measure of physical response. Sorry. And it's just an indication, again, of

Speaker 1:          04:11          rawness immediacy. And just, uh, kind of this is about sex. Let's be careful before we complicate it with all the factors that we habitually complicate female sexuality with. There is a core to this and we shouldn't be so quick to look away from it.

Speaker 2:          04:39          Mm.
