Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, Goldman recognize some of the problems early on. I can't say that you understood all that was coming, but certainly they repor recky dies the subprime mortgage crisis early in 2007 long before, uh, the crunch 18 months before the big crunch hit in the fall 2008. So he had a lot of firms like ups, a Swiss from continuing to invest heavily in subprime mortgages and losing tens of billions more. I think Goldman lost about 70 million in that crisis. But then in August of 2007, a very significant event took place that I talk about in my book seven lessons. And that's that uh, three of the quantitative quantitative funds, Goldman has went way down 30 to 40% as did all quant funds that day. And it was, this volatility was so extreme that the management saw that there's something odd going on in the markets and our models don't predict what's going on.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And as a result, they pulled back and said, we're going to start accumulating cash. You could say hardy cash accumulating cash. And so they spent a full year accumulating a lot of cash. So they came into the crisis in September, 2008 with over $120 billion in cash. If Layman had had another 20 billion, they probably would have been saved, but they didn't take those kind of moves. And so yes, there was a run on cash. Yes, there's liquidity crunch, but they were willing to, to uh, they, they had the capacity to stand in to that. And I think that's a good lesson for all of us. One of the things I talked about in my book, get ready for the long haul because if you think things are bad today, they're going to get worse, not better. And so you need to be ready for a long haul problem and have the cash reserves to pull you through it.

Speaker 1:          01:47          No, I don't. I think a, a firm like Goldman, it's human capital that matters and that's why you have to be so sensitive. The board spends an enormous amount of time on the human capital getting to know the people at all levels. Who are the, who are the rising stars, who are the people coming up in the system? Uh, I got a surprise as did the rest of the board. When Hank Paulson change his mind decided, said, except president bushes offered to become secretary of the treasury. That was may of 2006 and thank goodness we not only knew Lloyd, but we knew all the other top people. And we can make considered decisions not just about the CEO, but who the other structure where a Gary Cohen or Jon winkelried, he could step up and other people could take on greater responsibility and awaken hanks departure. Had we not known these people, we couldn't have done that. Now we're asking, you know, who's going to be the next CFO? Is gonna be the next chief personnel officer? It could be the next general counsel who are all these people. And so we have dinner with these people. We get to see him live and in action. They present to the board. Very good system. It could board doesn't do that. You're in trouble. But it is human capital. It's not a tech. You can, you do the technology, but everyone does the technology. That's nothing unique about that. The only thing unique is the human gap.

Speaker 1:          03:01          I like the word resilient because there were going to have with the timeframe compressed for technology change, uh, and operating in global markets, they're going to be more crises. This is hardly the last. And so I think firms need to be resilient and the system needs to be resilient and waiting for secretary geithner and Ben Bernanki to put in some, uh, frankly some, uh, some complete policies including the regulations and ensure the systems resilience. They keep talking about it. Here we are a year later, nothing has been done unlike Sarbanes Oxley, which done in 31 days. But I think firms need to have that resilience. One of them has ever, resilience is never to get so much leverage and drive your firms so hard that you don't have the cash to fall back on when you hit a crisis. That's why General Motors went bankrupt. And that's why Ford, uh, came through the crisis because they'd taken out $24 billion in loans and, uh, that allow, has allowed for it to come through. That's very strong. Where as GM and Chrysler had to get bailed out by the government.
