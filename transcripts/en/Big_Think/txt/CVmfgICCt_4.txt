Speaker 1:          00:13          Well, I think that the community and the loving and the end, the care that you can get from religion are very good things, of course. And if only there were more purely secular groups that provided not only the good works but also the community. I think that would be a good thing. I'm a, I've been talking with various people about the need to, uh, provide that structure in secular organizations and I think it's possible and I think we should work at it because you're absolutely right. People sometimes when there's nobody around to love you and take care of you. It's great to have a group that you can be welcomed into. Well, I suppose the simplest answer is it would be good if there were a, and there are already a churches without dogmas and in fact, uh, more and more churches downplay dogma to the point of evaporation and concentrate on providing just the sort of a, um, a community of care, mutual care and, and I'm helping the world. And so I think it's entirely possible that churches will evolve into sort of creedless organizations that do a lot of good work. And that would be wonderful.
