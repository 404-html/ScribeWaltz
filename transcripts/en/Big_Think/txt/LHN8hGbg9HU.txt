Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm.

Speaker 1:          00:05          The contemporary Internet is based on a fundamental lie. We all are told that it's social. We're all told they did. Now it's connectivity allows us to create community, but the reverse is actually true. It's atomizing us. It's not creating real community. It's actually separating us from people have different opinions of different cultures. It's increasingly an echo chamber effect where we're only ever connected with people who agree with us in the first place, but even more troubling. These social networks aren't really social. They're platforms for the self that plops for that platforms. For us to build brands. The clearest manifestation of this is our obsession with the selfie. The selfie becomes the cultural form of the Internet. Wherever we go, we picture ourselves in front of mausoleums in front of, as I say in the book, in front of people committing suicide at Auschwitz at every imaginable place.

Speaker 1:          01:03          In spite of all the bad taste associated with it. We are in our minds at least are diluted minds. The center of our universe. I argue again in terms of progress, that we've gone back to a a pre kapernick and understanding of the universe where everything of revolves around us. There's nothing social about that and the end consequences two fold. Firstly, we're making complete fools of ourselves that narcissism, that indulgence is embarrassing, and in the long run, we're going to regret it both as a species and individually. When we look back at those absurd photos of herself where we're shamelessly exposing, uh, our own self importance, we're going to be severely embarrassed by it. But secondly, it also reflects the reality of the Internet. It's about the individual. It's not about the social and the Internet is alienating, isolating, fragmenting ourselves. It's weakening community. That's of course the reason why it hasn't generated real political movements. It creates explosions. The Arab spring occupy, but no legacy, no political parties, no movements, no real foundations of political change.
