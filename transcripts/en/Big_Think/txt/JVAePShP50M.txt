Speaker 1:          00:13          A code of ethics doesn't solve. It might be a guide, but at the end of the day, individuals have to make their own ethical decisions every time they face a question in a quandary. I've had have had editors who have stood by me and defended me when I pissed off somebody in the company, and I've also have editors who come after me and said, oh, you can't do that because it's going to piss off somebody and no code was going to deal with that. I think that I've learned new ethics in the blog world. I line, that's not to say that they're better. That's not to say that I rejected the ethics of journalism than I learned before. I don't. I teach them, but I've learned an ethic of transparency online and my blog now, I tell you the stock I owned, who I vote for, and all kinds of things, things that I wouldn't have done back in the days when I was a full time reporter, but I think are very important now.

Speaker 1:          01:00          So I've learned an ethic of transparency. I've learned a new ethic of the correction on blogs. If we make a mistake, we don't erase it. We cross it out, we fess up, we admitted was there, and if we don't do that very quickly, we're going to lose credibility. I've learned an ethic of openness and collaboration. When I'm working on a story, I'm working on an idea. I asked my readers to help me and they are very generous. If I just ask, those are new ethics that I've learned online that I think old media can learn from. At the same time, there are ethics of the old world that live forever, that are immutable, a fairness, accuracy of balance, not objectivity, but I think those are things that we can do a better job of helping to teach from old media for our experience.
