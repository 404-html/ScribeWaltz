Speaker 1:          00:04          Hi Bill, my name is Sam. My question for you is why are we trying to live on Mars and recreate earth there by making it an atmosphere and soil and water we can drink and such. Why can't we take those ideas and motivation and directed at our own planet that we clearly need the help with? Why? Why is it easier to start fresh on another planet that get people talking about our own?

Speaker 2:          00:31          Sam. Sam, you are my man. Sam, you're thinking as I do. Okay. I meet a lot of people. You know, I'm the CEO of the Planetary Society. We advanced based science and exploration. I encourage you to join and as I say about the planetary society, we are not crazy. You meet a lot of people. I meet a lot of people who want to go to Mars and make it like earth. Just as you're the very idea that you're questioning and I think people don't, first of all, just don't grasp the scale of it. It's a planet. It's a whole planet. It's not a, it's not a wetland that you can reclaim and build a parking garage on top of. It's. It's a whole planet. Furthermore, this planet where you and I are from is perfectly suited to us. We our ancestors and their ancestors and so on, grew up here, tuned to these environments, to these climates that we have here on earth and so people want to go to Mars and the spirit of adventure.

Speaker 2:          01:38          Now, as you may infer from my accent, I'm from the United States and my a lot of my ancestors came here from Denmark and Europe and they set up shop and what the colony of Massachusetts and then they went all the way across North America to a through Wyoming, the state of Wyoming and now to the west coast to to Washington state and California, and they did that in this great tradition of pioneering spirit. Just keep going, keep expanding, keep spreading out, and human kind has done that. You know, everybody's from Africa or ancestors are all from the continent of Africa and we spread all over the world, spread to Australia across open ocean. The polynesians in canoes. Oh right, we're spreading now, man. We're going okay, and so people think, oh, let's spread out and go to Mars. It's a whole nother thing to go to Mars.

Speaker 2:          02:32          I tell people this all the time. There is nothing. There's hardly any water. There's a little bit. There is nothing to eat. There is no air, there's no air. What? We can build a bubble and you were moving into cook the Martian rocks and get the oxygen out of it. Okay? It's just not so easy. Just as you asked them, why don't we do that here on earth or do use that same technology here on earth and this is part my little mission as a human. No, not CEO of the planetary society is reminding everybody that we've got to take care of the earth in order for us all to live here. There are seven point 3 billion people as we're recording right now. By 2050, there will be nine and maybe even 10 billion people by the middle of the century and they're all gonna. Want to eat something and drink something and water and wash and carry on, and that's going to take us taking.

Speaker 2:          03:25          It's going to require us to take much better care of our own planet. Now, with that said, I like to remind everybody also, although you don't want to go to Mars and have a permanent settlement, there are colony. You do want to have a base there just as humankind has a base in the Antarctic where scientists go and study the Antarctic, learn about the environment, learn about our planet, learn about ice, and the are the earth's history and the climate today, and the greenhouse gases and the effective industrial emissions and so on. All of these discoveries are made in Antarctica. If we were to discover evidence of life on Mars, something that was once alive, they're the equivalent of a what a geologist called stromatolites fossilized bacteria that have turned to stone. It would be astounding if we found something still alive there. There are these recurring slope linear, which is geology expression.

Speaker 2:          04:30          For what look like rivulets look like little rivers. They may be just rockfalls turned over gravel. That as a slightly different color than the surrounding rock, but everybody thinks right now that it's water. Everybody's pretty sure by everybody talking about people at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA and European Space Agency, Isa Jackson, Japanese aerospace, exploration, Roscosmos. Everybody believes that there's recurring flows of water every Martian summer when what must be some subterranean, some under sand ice melts and if we. If you have liquid water anywhere on earth, there's something alive everywhere. There's liquid water. There's something alive. If there's something alive on Mars and we could prove it, show it to ourselves with our spacecraft or with human explorers walking around, I would change the world. It would be equivalent to the see the discoveries that copernicus made, that the earth goes around the so all the planets go around the sun, not the other way around, or Galileo.

Speaker 2:          05:35          We're not the only a body out in the cosmos. We got the moon. We in fact, Jupiter has its own moons and these other discoveries that were so profound a, if we were to find life on another world, it would. It would change this one and there's one more element that we at the of this that we at the planetary society celebrate these discoveries. There's of life on Mars or on the moon of Jupiter that is twice as much sea waters, the earth's called Europa. You can see it with binoculars, uh, at night. If we make this discovery of life, it will not have been done by an individual, by Galileo or copernicus or Irene Curie. It would be done by a society who invested it's intellect and treasure in this quest. Let's go see what's out there. Let's learn more about ourselves, our past and, and we all want to know whether or not we're alone in the universe. So if we look on these two worlds, the earth and Mars and find life on both of them that would suggest that life is very common in the cosmos and this would, this would affect the way each and every one of us feels about what it means to be a living thing in the cosmos. Would it means to have this place in space? As a great question? Carry on.
