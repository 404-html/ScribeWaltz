Speaker 1:          00:05          No, I don't think

Speaker 2:          00:11          since we're always much more complicated than heather positioned, facebook has done a brilliant job of opening up to third party applications. The issue isn't opening up its platform. It's. It has more to do with the individual's user graph or social graph if you like, which is who their friends are and when you start doing that you run into these privacy issues. It's, it's fine for me to decide. You can find out all about me, but as it fine for me to let you see who all my friends are. Maybe my friends don't want to be known as my friends and so I shouldn't necessarily have the right to reveal who all my friends are. One we'll use hypothetical example is suppose I'm gay and suppose I'm sensitive about that. Know in theory you shouldn't even be sensitive about it because it's okay, but some people are are they have to be in their work or whatever, and so if I have friends on my favorite lesbian site, they might not want me to open up my social graph to all my friends on facebook who could then say, oh, well that's interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:23          Esther has all these gay friends so people get outed by their association with me. I mean it's, it's a very complicated thing and I may have my own reasons for not wanting certain people to know certain things. Like I may have an ex boyfriend that I don't want to see certain things about my new boyfriend because rather than hating him and wanting to make him jealous, I still like him or you know, it's just. Or I may not want my mother to see pictures of my stepmother. Not Because of privacy, but because of a certain delicacy. Again, I have my own reasons for wanting to control this information. It's not quote privacy, but it's not something where I want even my friends to plaster my information all over the place. So it's, it's a complicated thing. What facebook did so brilliantly was they said, we're, we're not so much a single community. They're way too large to be a community. We are a platform on which people can build communities, but no, we don't want to be a public utility. We want to be a proprietary. Ultimately moneymaking utility and negotiating those shows is really tough and facebook hasn't done it without a bunch of errors on the way, but there are basic. This is what, yeah, who should have done and failed to do. Facebook is doing it. They're pioneering and they're, they're, they're learning by trial and error and every little errors being viciously.

Speaker 2:          03:15          It's a million small mistakes. I don't know. I mean the, the, the boats were all going by facebook jumped on and one of them and then turned it into a much bigger boat.
