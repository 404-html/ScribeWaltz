Speaker 1:          00:07          What are we doing right?

Speaker 2:          00:10          The key thing the irs is doing wrong in terms of energy policy overall, I think he's letting congress mandate foolish, foolish, uh, legislation like the ethanol scam, the congress in, in December of 2007 passed the energy independence and security act of 2007 and in doing so mandated the production of 36 billion gallons of ethanol by 2022. It is not going to happen. Um, this, I mean that what they have done is mandate the creation of a huge amount of motor fuel that the market cannot supply. But what is also happening is that they are increasing demand for corn and thereby and therefore other grains and it's causing enormous amounts of inflation in food prices and it's hurting consumers all over the country. So I think what the u s has been doing wrong with regard to energy policy is allowing Congress to meddle too much in the market and mandate certain solutions that are not economic and are not helpful.

Speaker 2:          01:05          Um, what is the US doing? Right? Uh, you know, I don't have to think about that one because there are no, there are no answers that come to mind. I think that we've, we've really, uh, uh, the mistake that we are making as well, in addition to the ethanol is relying on militarism. The U S has really, since the 1970s, in particular, had an approach to energy security that, uh, and that requires wrongly over militarization of the Persian Gulf, which I think has been a very, had very deleterious effects on the u s uh, the second Iraq war was, no matter how you slice it, was in fact about controlling the flow of oil out of Iraq and resting the control of Iraqi oil from Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, other countries around the world have, uh, have, have turned to the marketplace. They are not using militarism as a way to, uh, trying to assure energy supply and they are thriving and we're going bankrupt.

Speaker 3:          02:10          Okay.
