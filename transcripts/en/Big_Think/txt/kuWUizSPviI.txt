Speaker 1:          00:00          Religion is increasingly suppressed among educated people. It's not suppressed politically or legally, uh, but my students say, yeah, I'll as I students in colleges across the country, um, have no concept of what the Bible is or what's in it. Think of it as a toxic book. Know nothing about Christianity, less about Judaism. Um, so at the same time when the threats to human dignity, dignity and integrity are going to be ramped up to extraordinary levels of stress where we most need wisdom and moral seriousness. We're seeing wisdom and moral seriousness come under attack. And often from the same people who want to do the genetic engineering is crusading. Crusading. Atheism is sort of a clause today is popular. I don't want to say among scientists, I mean as to do general. It isn't so, but there are certainly a prominent people in the scientific community are prominent people who were religious Jews or Christians in the scientific community.

Speaker 1:          01:03          But there are also prominent people, um, who have taken their atheism to the public successfully, who are crusading atheist, who preach atheism, atheism in an aggressive way. Um, as a consequence of the science, they play on people's weakness in ignorance. So far as most people don't take the trouble to learn science. It's easy for a scientist to saying, I'm smarter than you are because I know it and you don't know. I understand the genome and you don't. I understand the physics. I can do hard calculus problems and not just twelfth grade level one. So you can see how much smarter I am than than, than you are. And what I tell you there, there are no moral absolutes and religion is trash. And furthermore, we ought to go ahead with human cloning. We should go ahead with genetic engineering and implantables sorts, which will smudge line between human and machine.

Speaker 1:          01:50          We're getting into a, a moral conflict of interest, which is tremendously dangerous. I, I don't think we will succumb. I mean, I think, you know, human beings have faced hard challenges. The Second World War was, is difficult to crisis as mankind ever will face a, I'm 50 million people died. I'm a humanity. Teetered on the edge. I'm a state. Paganism was preached aggressively by Hitler. I Germany, which despised Christianity as much as I hated Jews. It didn't hate Christians as people, but it hated Christianity. Um, uh, the Japanese empire, which was a w which revived stay paganism in preference to the more sophisticated religion of Buddhism and Christianity that had been popular in Japan. Stalinist Russia, which was an aggressively pagan nations, suppressed Christianity. That was a crisis of enormous crisis. We rose to the occasion. We defeated it. It damaged us. We still bear the scars. Um, I think we're going to face a crisis in the coming century. It will be different in character. He's never the same. We never see the same crisis twice. Um, I, I know we have the moral, a strength to rise to the occasion, and I hope and pray that we do in practice.
