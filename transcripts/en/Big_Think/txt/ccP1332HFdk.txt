Speaker 1:          00:00          No,

Speaker 1:          00:07          I did not collect the tomes written for one kind of high, had relatively little to do with that book. That book was collected largely by attorneys who volunteer their time to work with people who were detained often with minimal, amazingly minimal, uh, legal process, uh, people who were detained at Guantanamo. And, uh, I would assume with that, knowing very little about it, there's a tremendous range, uh, people, uh, uh, range, culturally range of a bunch shirt ranges for people who are tremendously guilty of many things. The people who were really center, many, many things. I'm the editor at the press. It was about to publish that book. Originally talked to me about writing an introduction and uh, they sent me the manuscript. I tried conscientiously to read the poems and uh, I hope I correctly recognized my own inadequacy. I was not going to be able to write introduction to these palms. You would have to, at the minimum, you would have to know something about Arabic poetry. You would have to know a little bit about these cultures. And uh, they come from cultures in which amateur poetry is a very important component. I'm familiar with amateur poetry, this country. I've taught adult classes. I've taught in prisons. Uh, I don't say amateur with a sneer. Um, in many ways it's possible to idealize the country in which there's a lot of amateur poetry. You know, it might be good for professionals like me. Uh,

Speaker 1:          01:50          but I felt inadequate to writing the introduction. And at the same time, uh, I felt strongly about the abuses, civil liberties and, uh, that, uh, military people were shocked. Millet, people in military people, uh, legal, military people were appalled at what was happening there. And these guys who've just been a tremendous fixed the pickle they were in, they'd been put in by the government of my country. I didn't want to just say, oh, I'm so sorry. This is not my field. So I tried to write a blurb, um, that would at least put my name in the book and say, this is an urgent book for us to be aware of when you're thinking about these people. Uh, they shouldn't just be sealed away. Uh, and, um, apart from leasing from a government that we don't work it as a part of Cuba. Uh, if you read that in facilities Hurghada disputes, I can't figure these people, I don't know what, what, what's going on here. Anyway, there they are in this part of Cuba that we lease from this government. We refuse to have anything to do with and uh, we must have just forget about them. Uh, they need to be thought about. And, uh, I was speaking because I had been appealed to it. We've very aware that my gifts and knowledge, uh, whatever they are as a poet, we're not terrifically Germane to the content.

Speaker 2:          03:15          To that point.
