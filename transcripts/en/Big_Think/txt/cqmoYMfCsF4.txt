Speaker 1:          00:09          I mean Google of Rod is, you know, just, just, just recently rolled out, um, integration of, of, of realtime search and taking twitter and, and uh, and status updates and putting that in as one of the options within the web. And obviously, I mean, not just not just google news, but number different google properties are all very curious and, and, and beating to think through what does it mean for us? How do we take advantage of that? Um, the way I, the way I, I, I think about it from, from the new side of it, is there, there, there are two aspects of it. One is just the content itself. I mean, is there value in those tweets, um, uh, or is it just, is your sort of stream of information that by itself just adds more noise to it? I think there's probably some of both.

Speaker 1:          00:48          And, and that's, that's a key part of what we try and do is not just index the world's information, but also trying to organize it in some level. And so applying that to real time information is very challenging. Um, so I think that that's one thing that we're looking at the other part of is just simply as another signal, um, of, of a way of sort of picking up those tweets about a certain topic or linking to a certain story. And is there a signal there that's helpful for us and trying to pick up information quicker. We're trying to understand people's preferences for certain sources are for certain stories. Um, and so even if you never even surface that information that we're, that the real time tweets that are there, how can you leverage those, uh, those signals to do a better job of presenting what you have on your own site. So I think both of those are areas that we're actively looking at and trying to figure out what's there. But I'm sure we'll put something out there and, and maybe the first iteration will, will, will not work. But that's, that's I think, um, that's sort of the fun part about trying to see how you can, you can move forward and that's a makes, makes things never dull.

Speaker 1:          01:49          I, uh, I don't know that in, in just a few seconds or minutes or probably hours, I could explain what, what, uh, what ways, I think that the idea behind wave that was, was really interesting. It was, um, if email didn't exist, how would you communicate? I think that was sort of the, the, the thought that a lot of the engineers, um, started with, with, with Google wave and really trying to reimagine how people can communicate. Um, so it's part email, it's part chat. Uh, it's part collaborative, a collaborative documents. Um, so it's kind of all these roll together. It's, it's one of these things you need to play around with it to, to really even begin to try and articulate what it is. But that's one of the things is that we've gotten a lot of interest from, uh, from journalists saying, we think this is really fits well with how we do our job.

Speaker 1:          02:33          And this is, this is potentially a tool that we would want to take advantage of, um, to tell stories, to create that to, um, uh, to create stories in a different way than how we do it right now. Even though it sort of fits with the way we gather facts and information and check and check sources, um, like how do we, how do we sort of met, migrate that to the web and make it a much more of an, of an open process. Uh, I think wave is still at the early stages, uh, to try and figure out how it's going to be used. Um, and journalism is just sort of one of the things that we've, we've seen a few different organizations beginning to play around with don't know what's, what's ultimately gonna happen with, with either wave, the, the larger discussion and also specifically around around journalism.

Speaker 1:          03:15          Well, it's certainly, I mean, the things that I talked about, some of those trends in a, about personalization, um, I mean that, that's a big one for us. Uh, and the social nature of news, uh, to, I mean, I think those are things that, um, we, we've had in bits and pieces, but I don't think we've necessarily gotten it all together. Um, it's tough. I mean, it's really hard when you talk about personalization. Even explicit personalization is not easy to do well. Uh, and even if you get those, those signals from users, I'm trying to make sure that you get them right and you interpret them in the right way. That's not an easy, easy challenge to say nothing of. The whole idea of implicit personalization of just saying, I come to the website, you should know what I'm supposed to, what would I want to read? Um, need to say that, that, that's even trickier. So those are some of the things that we're, we're really thinking about. And how do you, how do you present that in a, in a, in a, in a meaningful way to our users?

Speaker 1:          04:06          The balance, because I think you don't want to have the sort of echo chamber where you're just getting that same news and information from the same sources and people that you've, you've always gotten before. Um, I think you really want to try and have that balance of, of information that's personalized to you. Um, but sort of, uh, at the same time you don't want to lose the serendipity. Um, and also the important news and information. Let's say you need to know, you may not want to read this, but you need to know this. Uh, and so those are, those are some of the things that I think are, um, you know, can be challenged on the web, especially at the serendipity of it. Like I was not searching for this. I didn't know that I wanted to read this, but I'm glad that I found this on my, uh, on my site.

Speaker 1:          04:44          That's much easier to do right now in a paper. And he sort of pick it up. You see the top stories of the day, but then there, here's an article the editors decided to place on the front page because they think it's important that they think that it's interesting. How do you introduce that online? Um, so those are, those were some of the things you need to balance with that, you know, the, the, the really personalized news stream with other things that just, you know, you may not know that they matter, or rather you may not be thinking, thinking them through to sort of say, I want to search for it. I want to subscribe to this feed. But how do I get that in front of a, it's important that, that I get that in front of the user.
