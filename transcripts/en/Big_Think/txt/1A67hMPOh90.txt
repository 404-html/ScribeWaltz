Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          no, not at all. I think a lot of people don't understand this at all. First of all, understand that in the state of New York, there has been very active conservative party for decades, uh, elected Senator Buckley in the seventies. And if you look at the history of congressional races in New York, probably a lot of other races I've seen through congressional races, the Conservative Party oftentimes nominates a person historically, they've been the good sports that have been willing to step back and throw their support to the Republicans in the interest of stopping a more Liberal Democrat from getting in office. Now, what happened in New York, 23rd was a handful of people got into a back room and nominated a democrat. And the first thing we heard, for example in my shop at freedom works was from our grassroots activists in the north country of New York. They said, the Republicans have just lost this race.

Speaker 2:          01:12          Uh, this woman can't possibly win this race. She would not ever want a republican primary. She was too liberal. If there's no way she would have won the Republican primary. So. So what happened was the conservative party said, oh my gosh, the Republicans are about to lose his race, uh, and they feel that their candidate. So what happened was there were three candidates from three different parties in the race to liberals in the Republican and Democrat nominees, and one conservative, the conservative candidate, although he was a first time candidate, a quite naive and innocent in the ways of politics. He, he grew so fast in his standing with the electorate that she got knocked out of the race when she got knocked out of the race. What did she do? She made a deal with the White House and Chuck Schumer and endorsed a Democrat. So what did I say?

Speaker 2:          02:08          First validation. I see aneurysm are grassroots activists called that correctly, didn't they? They did. In fact, nominated Democrats and the Conservative Party failed to win that election. Now, this is a short term victory for the Republicans. They can celebrate it all they want because a year from now, they're, the Democrats will lose that seat because the Republicans will have an open primary. They'll nominate a conservative Republican or at least a middle of the road Republican, and that person will win the race back from the Democrats so that Democrat will only sit in that office for about a year and when that happens, the Conservative Party will once again play their role of being in support of their principals and working the republican nominee a little bit more to their perspective on public and, and then helping him beat the Democrat.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Social issues were so much. So I was up there. I mean socialists were just simply not part of the debate in that race. The Democrat candidate, when it was just the two of them and erase the Democrat, was running a gastro as a big spender. And so her, her first dress Greshon, whereas she was four, she was four big budgets. She was for cap and trade. She was for a card check. The Mandatory Union plan that denied workers' a secret ballad. Uh, so she, she took on economic issues, eras and I, I saw no discussion of social issues in that race on economic issues. She was so liberal that even the Democrat was running against her for being too liberal at some point. Everybody who are seeking office or wanting to hold office at some point they have to respond to the voting constituency whose votes they want.

Speaker 2:          04:10          And right now the Republicans are in office, are kind of confused about that. This, this tea party movement, which is what you see right now is most visible and grassroots conservativism is a thousand points of entrepreneurial light into it. In, in a, uh, advocate, advocating small government, conservative Islam just popped up all over the country. Uh, and it is genuine. He largest grassroots movement I've ever seen on a, on particularly the economic issues. The office holders are start, oh, I get it. If I want to be reelected, I better be responsive to what these guys are telling me. That's where all the energy, there is no greater source of energy in public policy, discourse and politics today. Then the small government conservative. So the, the Orthodox Republican Party is dispirited and confused and going through a massive identity crisis where they're trying to. Jay Basically ask the question is, who are we and what are we doing here? The Democrats are inflicted with probably the most severe case of buyer's remorse they ever had, even worse than with the Clintons and 93 and 94 a day, they have no energy to bring to the field, so the field is right now dominated by the extremely big tent. I was small government conservativism, which has Democrats, Republicans, independents, Libertarians, evangelicals, people of all stripes and color, and I'm religious orientation, and they're all happily joined in resistance to a growth in the power of the state that they find frightening for their personal liberty.
