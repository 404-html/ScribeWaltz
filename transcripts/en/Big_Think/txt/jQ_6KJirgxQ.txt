Speaker 1:          00:03          One of the things that I think companies do to a large degree that makes very little sense is the use of focus groups, so think about what a strange idea is that we take 10 people who know basically nothing about your project and you put them in a room and you let them talk for awhile and then you take the whatever they came up with as a consequence of these two hours of random thinking and you base your strategy on it to a large degree and, and I, I don't want to say that focus groups are always useless and also uninformative, but I think that taking this data and then realizing it as extensively as companies do, I think. I think it's crazy in many ways and the reason I think companies do it is because when these people create a sentence or an idea, it's very easy to say, joe focus group 17 said this and it can help you create a form.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Formulate an idea around it. When if you said 87 percent of the people said x, it just doesn't have a face. It doesn't have a desire. It's just not as concrete and therefore people are not as excited about the, about the notion. So I think that focus group is incredibly useful as a persuasive attempt, uh, to, to tell people what to do, but as a way to find out information, it's not as useful as people think it is. The other thing that really puzzles me is that company is how little they understand about how incentives really work. So the biggest expenditure for almost any company is salaries. And you ask people what do you know about the relationship between salaries and performance? The answer is nothing. Right? And, and the question is why don't they study anything? Why don't they study, why don't they try different performance, different incentive level and see how it influenced a performance.

Speaker 1:          01:49          And they often say, well, the law kind of low laws and if we have pay some people one way and some another way we might be sued. And when the last two years with all these questions about bonuses and so on, I've gone to many companies and said, why don't we at least do some surveys? Why don't we at least see how happy people are on the months when they give them, you give them the bonus and how productive they are, and the answer I got 100 percent of the time is that people are really miserable in bold decision and because of that they don't want to ask them any more questions and I said, if people are miserable in bonuses and shouldn't it mean that you should study it, understand it and try to prevent it from next for next year and say, well, well not this year.

Speaker 1:          02:29          This year was really miserable. Maybe next year come back to us next year, but if you think about. It's really incredible. Now how do companies decided about compensation? They look at what other companies are doing and try to equate compensation to what other companies are doing it, but it's a place of the blind leading the blind. Right? And then if we pay five percent more, other people will start doing it. But the real question is how do you pay and how do you get people to care about their work and become more productive and be happier at their work? And the answer is not simply that more money is better, more money can be part of the equation, but it's also the question of how do you give that money? You give it a bonus to give it as a fixed salary. Do you give it as a part of the benefits? Maybe you give benefits for the gym. Do you send people on vacation to the Bahamas? And it turns out that there are ways to use money that he's cannot make the less efficient, but actually get people to be more motivated, caremore and actually become more productive.
