Speaker 1:          00:07          I would like the American political process to change. I don't know how or when or just don't know how that would happen or how it's going to happen. I feel like we have this two party system that is serving the two party system and companies, big companies in America and to the detriment of, of the, the supposedly populous of America that is supposedly the, you know, who the government is supposed to be serving. And I also think they environment is a, is a big issue. Um, I was just reading about green accounting this morning, um, which is basically trying to work, um, the environment into the balance sheet on a, on a corporate level so that I'm a so that if you, you know, the, the example was if you chopped down a redwood tree to make a picnic table, like for the picnic table maker that has, uh, you know, it has an effect on their bottom line is that has an effect on the US GDP.

Speaker 1:          01:08          But what effect does that have on people who would normally use that redwood in its natural sort of environment? You know, we have all this wealth that's, that's essentially being created from nature, I mean from the energy of the sun, from, um, both pretty much from the energy of the sun and the energy, the earth and through people sweat and things like that. And you have all these companies making all this money, you know, from nature. But I think the balance sheet is kind of uneven in that regard. We're not, I don't think we're giving enough back and at some point we're gonna find ourselves in, in trouble as far as not having enough planet to live on. Perhaps.
