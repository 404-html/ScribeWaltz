Speaker 1:          00:07          They'll shaft writer Aquarius. Well, actually the first time, you know, I was always a funny and my family is funny. I'm the fifth of six children from the large Jewish family. That was, it was never enough guilt to go around. And um, when I was 18 I was at deerfield academy and uh, me and a few of my friends, we might have stolen a faculty member's car and we drove into North Hampton and I did seven minutes of standup, mostly stolen material at a bar called the early times and from the ages of 18 to 22, I think I probably performed twice a year. I wanted my undergraduate talent show at, at Harvard doing stand up. And it was always something I knew I could do. It was always like a hobby with me, but I always had the feeling that if the nut came to crunch a, I could make a little money at it.

Speaker 1:          01:06          But I majored. I majored in Latin at Harvard because I thought the church was going to come back. And um, you know, it's one of those things where I majored in Latin and Greek because I loved, that was the only thing I really was interested in academically. It really, I think it's the best preparation for a writer because it teaches you the value of a word and of the word. And um, so I went to Harvard fully intending to be either, you know, a Latin teacher or a pharmacist, you know, I mean really, really, what can you do with a classics degree? And I'm a, I ended up, I think I got a c minus in. I'm in a graduate course my freshman year in Hurghada this. And then I turned my sites to becoming a sports writer. And uh, I did that for awhile and then I became, I was a standup comic for 13 years.

Speaker 1:          01:59          And then in 1991 I was hired, uh, by then late night with David Letterman at NBC and, and here we are when you're 16, 17, 18, and you're staying up and you're watching the tonight show. And this is, this is the mid, the early and mid seventies, you know, it's, it's George Carlin and Richard Pryor. And, and I was introduced to Lenny Bruce when I was 18, so huge influence on not my standup but me wanting to become a standup and I was just one of those guys that I would watch the standups and boy, that must be great to do that. But you know, you never think that that's what you're gonna do. And, and I ended up doing it for, for, for 13 years. And uh, I heard, I don't know who's this line has, but it's a great line, is that people become standup comics. Uh, the same way a woman becomes a hooker. I mean, you start, uh, doing it, um, for, uh, a couple of friends and then you realize you're good enough to get paid.

Speaker 1:          03:16          When I was a comedian and I was a comic for 13 years, my act was Jews sports and whether that was pretty active. Talk about being Jewish. I did a lot of sports material because I was a sports writer and uh, and I also had a Gig a later on I was, I had my own humor column in sports illustrated for three years called the show, which I love, which was the perfect marriage of all my careers. It was just topical jokes about sports every week and um, and, and, and I was a, I'm going to steal David Letterman's line about his standup career. I was good. I was a good standup, but I was never going to be the guy that you pay $20 to see. I was just not going to because because unlike my wife who still performs my heart wasn't in it. I didn't have to be up there.

Speaker 1:          04:09          I was good enough to be up there. I made a living at it. But boy, I'll tell Ya, you know, 12 years in and you wake up in, in a motel six in Covington, Kentucky, and you say to yourself, I'm not in show business. I'm just willy Loman with a bag of jokes. I'm just going from town to town trying to, you know, trying to get the people in in a different town and that's, that's all it was. But I was, you know, I was one of those guys that was out there and I did every television show except the ones that could help your career. It was so funny because they knew me at the letterman show, not as a writer because I used to audition to try and get on the show as a comic. And I had a line in my act, uh, which has been a, I'm proud to say has been stolen by several comics at a line in my act.

Speaker 1:          04:58          I said, for those of you here in New York, it's great. The dyslexic theater company is in town and they're doing. He gets your nug and Bob Martin, the producer, Letterman, said, if you have six more minutes as good as that one line, he said, I will put you on next week. And sadly I did. I had some good lines. I had some good lines. I've forgotten them all. I, um, you know, a couple of years ago I wrote for Chris Rock on the Academy Awards and he hired a lot of comics to right, and it was a lot of people I hadn't seen a long time because I stopped performing and Carol Liefer was one of the writers and Carol for and we went out the first night we went out for Chinese food and Carolee for said, you know, every time I have Chinese food I think about your bit about Chinese food. And I said to her, I'd love to hear it because I have no recollection of this. And the bit was I used to do a bit about, um, you know, when you go out for Chinese food, they take down your order in Chinese, the waiter, how are you supposed to dispute this bill at the end of the meals? He gives me a waiter. I didn't order the television antenna and that's the kind of cutting edge stuff that came out of me.

Speaker 1:          06:14          First of all. Thank you. Uh, I'm, I'm glad that the question is phrased so that it's assumed that I write funny stuff every day. I appreciate that, you know, I think if you do it and if you, if you write for a strip show, which is what Letterman is, which is a show that's on five days a week, um, you don't think about it in terms of if you ever, if I ever thought about what I had to do at the beginning of every day, I don't think I could do it. It's just with comedy writing, especially writing on a daily basis. It's a muscle that you work and it's, it's, you know, and if you keep working it, you can do it. And Woody Allen once said about joke writing, if you can do it, there's nothing to it. And I believe that and I'm mostly with the letterman show.

Speaker 1:          07:07          I've been a monologue writer, so the, I just write jokes for the most part. I work on other stuff on the show and it's just when I first started the show in 1991 and they told me I had to write 15 jokes a day. I thought, how am I going to do this? And then I just tried to get through that day. And then within about six months I was, I wasn't writing 15 jokes a day, I was writing 25 or 30 and it got to the point where I was writing like 50 or 60 jokes a day and you know, they're not all great and actually very few of them are great. But that's the thing about comedy is that you have to, you have to write a lot to get, you have to make mounds and mounds of Cole slaw to get one good serving. And that's what we do on the letterman show. We just create a lot of content and ideally the best content gets on the show.

Speaker 1:          08:08          Here's the thing about the late show with David Letterman, the writers and Dave letter. We write a lot of stuff that's funny. We read a lot of stuff. It's pretty good. We read a lot of stuff that's lame, but invariably, invariably night after night, the funniest moments in this show are dave reacting in real time to his surroundings. And it's something that you cannot write in preparation for the show. And Dave comes out at the beginning of the night, the writer's job is to put him in a situation where if he needs it, it's there, you know, the monologue is there. If he needs it, the top 10 is there. If he needs a couple of good tape pieces are there, if he needs it, and then he can just relax and just react in the moment. And uh, you know, I have a friend, Kelly Rogers, who I started with who was a great comic that people don't know about and Kelly Rogers said something that was so profound.

Speaker 1:          09:11          He said, your act is for the nights when you're not funny. And, and that's, that's the, that's what the writer's supply to Dave, they supply him enact for those nights when, when he doesn't feel funny. And, and I have yet to see a nightlight that Larry and I used to talk about this all the time at the beginning of the show because originally they got picked up for four episodes and he would say just enough for the four shows that we're doing. But after that they pick the show up. I don't remember what am I supposed to do? And I said, uh, Larry, uh, it's eight in the morning. I just woke up please. But it's one of those things where the longer you do it, the more things occur to you. And of course now Larry, David having worried about that. Okay, let me start that again.

Speaker 1:          10:10          And now Larry David having worried about that at the beginning, he figured out a way throughout the years to incorporate his life into his work and you know, how you know, how you're out at dinner with friends and somebody says something or something happens and somebody at the dinner table says, this is just like an episode of Seinfeld a, okay? That may or may not be true, but when you're with Larry David, you never know when a, you know, a scene from curb your enthusiasm is going to burst out. And I'll just give you an example. A couple of years ago, uh, Larry and I were having dinner and, uh, we got to the end of the meal and I said to him, how about some dessert? And he said to me, no, no dessert for me. Ted Danson and I have a bet, no dessert for a year. And I thought, who? It's Larry David, it's Ted Danson. They're both billionaires. The bed is no dessert for a year. I mean, the bed has got to be at least $50,000, maybe 100,000, maybe. It's a million dollars. I said to him, how much is the bed for? He says, $200. I said, have a piece of frigging cake.

Speaker 1:          11:29          Let me just say this about Larry David a try as he might to distance himself from the character that the world sees, he will be unsuccessful at that because I, I know this guy, you know, there's a great expression, a alcoholics are just like everybody else except more so. And uh, Larry David is just like the guy you see in curb your enthusiasm except more so he has, um, again, and I wish this was my line, but somebody once said about famous people, um, when they get famous they don't get better. And Larry David is the exception to that because Larry, as he has gotten better known, is much more comfortable in his skin and he used to be and much more self aware. And I'll give you an example. We were at a Yankee game, uh, last year and a kid comes up, you know, 18, 19 years old, comes up with a pen and paper and his is, uh, you know, a Mr David can, can I get short of graph?

Speaker 1:          12:47          And he and Larry says to them, oh, come back after the [inaudible] this is no good either in the middle of a game. And the kid says, well, I can always just come back in the, in the, you know, after the inexact I'm watching the game. And, and the kid says, uh, but, but you don't understand it, let us know. And then hearing himself do that, he burst out laughing and sign the kid's paper. So like I have to tell you, 15 years ago, that does not happen. That does not 15 years ago, uh, this whole scenario winds up in small claims court.

Speaker 1:          13:28          I've been at the letterman show since 1991 and that's 18 years and I would say during that time the comedic sensibility of the show has changed, I want to say half a dozen times because Dave has gotten older, but the average age of the average writer has stayed the same. So they bring in their sensibilities and what they think is fun and they try and interject it into the show. And so the show's comedic sensibility, uh, changes and it's, it's all valid and we don't write anything and think, oh, I need to write this joke to appeal to the crucial male, 18 to 34 demographic. We don't think like that. At least I don't. I just think what's the funniest take that, that I can do. And sometimes, uh, I think that things have passed me by just because I'm older and the people watching are our younger sometimes I think that.

Speaker 1:          14:37          But funny is funny is funny. And, uh, if you show somebody, a Marx brothers movie who's never seen one, I think that they'll think it's funny and I don't think that they're going to ask why isn't groucho naked? You know, I want to see Groucho's deal late night has really changed in the last, um, I think in the last three decades, let's say. I think that first of all, there's more variety and there's more competition. You know, before 1982, there was johnny and Johnny Carson and people that he knocked off. So all of late night was just, was carson and it was a monologue. It was some sort of body broad comedy aimed at people over 30, clearly, um, and uh, white people over and white men over over 30. And um, so that was it. And then Dave came along in 1982 and NBC gave Dave Letterman one directive, uh, whatever you do, we want it not to be the tonight show.

Speaker 1:          16:04          So we want a three joke monologue, not a 25 joke monologue a we want, you know, we just don't want it to look like the tonight show. So, given that, go ahead, it was very free flowing. It was irony based, uh, and it was a, the old producer, Bob Moore used to say a late night with David Letterman. It celebrated failure. It was not slick. It was very, uh, anarchistic. And um, so that was so, so then that comes along. Then, uh, you have dave move into cbs 1130 and you have this situation with Jay where, uh, you had a one show, uh, that was a host driven, which is Dave and, and, uh, material driven. I'm more, I would say more concept driven. And then he had another show which is Jay who was just essentially just a comic who got his own show and its monologue and guests and a little more, uh, a traditional.

Speaker 1:          17:21          And then you had the 1230 shows with Conan and all of a sudden they were. David started this with going after younger audiences. I mean, people always say, I started watching Dave and college and uh, so there was a real market out there. And then, like I mentioned before, late night became this very lucrative, um, uh, industry for the networks, very cheap to produce very, and course once a commercialism, once people start making money, it's going to tend to get watered down and it's not gonna be as a, it's not going to be as fearless, um, because there's a lot of people that depend their livelihoods depend on your success, so it's not just kids screwing around anymore. And then what happened in, I would say the late nineties, uh, is that the other, the cable emerge as a late night force with the daily show and Kobe Bayer and it was much more topical, not that the Letterman show we always took care of what was in the news and so did Jay, but it, it became a more of a, the, the topical stuff.

Speaker 1:          18:43          It became more topical and more issue oriented. And, and I think we've certainly gone in that direction at the late show. And so that's the evolution of that now. I think that if I was to predict and, and believe me, I'm always wrong. So put your money elsewhere. I think we're going to reach a critical mass with the topicality thing and people getting their news because I think it's going to get a little too partisan and I think that a late night shows are going to be put in a situation that they shouldn't be put in a, you know, unbeknownst to them, and I think it's probably going to go back to a little sillier and, um, uh, a little less a celebrity driven and, um, and, and kind of easier to take and less fo serious. You look at a guy like Craig Ferguson and watch what he's doing. He, nobody is doing what he's doing and, and I think he'll, I think he'll, he will emerge because he is silly. It's all him, you know, uh, you know, the guests don't really have to say anything. He's going to take care of it. And I think that, um, I think that that's where we're going.

Speaker 1:          20:16          I don't think that Johnny ever dream that he would influence a, an election. Um, you know, he, uh, he never talked about Watergate when Watergate was going on and talked about it after the fact. Uh, but, uh, you know, Tina fey had as much to do with the last election as a, as Dave did with the situation with mccain as the daily show, a does. So, uh, you know, look where is, I mean that's where we are, where these shows and, and, and, and, and none of these shows set out to influence elections, but that's what happens. They're there, right in the popular culture. And you know, I never bought all those, uh, um, studies and surveys about people getting their news from late night television. I and I still don't, but I think that people turn to late night television, um, to see what the point of view is on the news. I think they know going in, I don't think we're in the education business. Here's the deal with society. People Fall in love with the idea of things rather than the reality of things. And that holds true for late night. You know, it's, it's so much a more provocative and sexier to say that people are watching our show and getting their news from Dave letterman. And let me tell you, as somebody that writes monologue jokes and somebody that knows Dave, I tell them, you, we find that very funny.

Speaker 1:          21:58          Here's the difference between a writing a monologue jokes in writing a fiction, uh, well, first of all, use the word intern much less and waterboarding much less when you write fiction. No, it, it's, it's just, it's a different muscle. A writing a monologue jokes or writing jokes for a nightly show is a volume business. It's a volume business. You're just turning out a quantity and then panning for gold. So it's, you're using, uh, in, in the words of the steroid universe, you're using your quick twitch muscles. You know, you're just firing more, you're firing quicker and you're just reacting quicker. And it's all about, takes different, how many different takes to a premise. So that's, that's writing comedy for television. Now, writing a fiction, writing humorous fiction, everything slows down and it's a different muscle and it's a state of mind. And uh, you know, I think writing jokes is, is a real physical practice.

Speaker 1:          23:16          And um, and it's all free association and, and writing fiction. Again, it's inhabiting a, it's getting into a state of mind where you're a for me, where you're inhabiting this world of these characters you created. And for me, writing fiction, you know, I want to be funny. I want my premises to be funny. I want my situations to be funny. I want my characters to be complicated, but it must be plausible. It must be even however chaotic. It must be plausible. And the thing about a lot of great monologue jokes is that they are not plausible. There's sort of a little really, you know, it's like when we talked about this, people ask me, how'd you learn to write fiction? Well, I learned to write fiction writing for Dave because, uh, you know, all of a sudden we'd have some jokes about Hillary Clinton and Dave would say, let's just start it with, hey, have you heard Hillary Clinton's going to jail? Well, she's not. She never was, but he loved that it was a grabber. He could get a laugh and then he would, he could come down off it, off the joke. Now that might find its way in somebody else's novel, but it's never going to find its way in a minute. I'll give you an example.

Speaker 1:          24:46          When Hillary was elected to the Senate, um, and, and then bill was out of office. There was a story in the times that he was a little lonely in Chappaqua. He was sort of rattling around the house, so he would go down once a week and have breakfast at a coffee shop in Chappaqua. And that's kind of quaint. It's kind of charming. Well, that, that wasn't good enough for us. That was, that we didn't like that, that wasn't good comedically. So we did jokes for two weeks about him hanging out at a singles bar in Chappaqua. We just made up all these and it was great and we had a ball with it. And, and it is it. Well, I guess I'm sort of arguing against myself because it is a little plausible. The Clinton might go to a singles bar, but we just made it up and um, and people knew we had made it up and it was, it was very valid as, as a, as comedy. So that's the deal of the best advice I ever got about writing fiction was, um, right. What you know, and make your character's lives complicated because, you know, we all have a story in us and it's, it's our autobiography. And I know we think it's fascinating. God knows I do and it may very well be fascinating, but it aint complicated.

Speaker 1:          26:15          This is my third novel. Everything hurts and, and it is, um, it is born of a real life. This is a book about a guy trying to get rid of a psychosomatic limp. And he seeks the aid of a legitimate self help guru. He's an accidental self help guru and to cure him of his psychosomatic limp, he seeks the aid of a legitimate self help guru and is borne of real life. Because for three and a half years I dragged a foot, I limped, I was in constant pain and it was a. It confounded doctorsx, rays and Mris, turned up nothing. The pain moved around. There was no consistent symptomatology. It came and went of its own accord. It made no sense to anybody, but I was in constant pain and so I sought the help of a guy who specialized in a psychosomatic pain.

Speaker 1:          27:14          And uh, he believes that the pain is caused by unconscious rage driving to your conscious mind and your conscious mind is so threatened by the coming rage that it tries to distract you by giving you pain to a vulnerable area. That's his theory. I still believe in it. I really do. And so his approach is to examine your past. So I'd been seeing him for a little while and I said, you know what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write a novel about a guy trying to get rid of a psychosomatic limp and try to get myself out of this pain. And I started writing it. It took me two years to finish. Two years later, I'm finished with the book, son of a bitch guy in the book is fine. I'm still dragging a foot and in constant pain. So I sold the book to Simon and Schuster.

Speaker 1:          28:05          Ten days after I sold the book I went to yet another doctor took another look at another x ray and said to me, you need a hip replacement. I'm not telling you you should get one. I'm telling you, you have to get one. This is a no brainer. And so a year ago in July, last July, I got my hip replaced. I'm out of pain. I feel great. And everybody who, you know, suffered along with me said, you must be furious. Three and a half years limping and constant pain. And I say the same thing, all of them. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have gotten the book out of it. So, you know, the journey is the destination, right?

Speaker 1:          28:49          You have no idea. Um, because as I, as I mentioned, I was in constant pain and one of the few times that I was not in pain was when I was writing. And I mean writing at the letterman show or working on the fiction, but at the end of the day here, the day would be over. I'd come home and relax, put my feet up, incredible pain, and they could not be relieved by any pill or anything like that, which made me sure it was a. and so this book is a reflection of that. And, uh, I think that, um, you know, and I'm sure people have said this before, but, uh, artists create because they have to, not because they need to and not because they think they should, but because they have to. And this is, this was a classic case of it. So it was very fulfilling. It was very ambitious because I was suffering while I was writing it and the guy is getting better and it's like, and I was aspiring to the character I was writing about, which is a boy, I'd love to recreate that in my next book. Wouldn't that be great?
