Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm Rick Perlstein, I'm the author of Nixon's land problem with Obama's postcards and agenda is that he came into it, he came into his presidency, uh, at a time when millions of Americans, perhaps even tens of millions of Americans don't consider a Democrat president legitimate, don't get sued or liberalism legitimate, don't consider the idea of the state farm new programs to help people legitimate. Uh, so he's in a situation a lot like, you know, April Abraham Lincoln face in 18, 60 when you had millions of Americans who didn't even consider what was going on in Washington to have anything to do with them. So the big question for me was always was this post partisan idea, this idea that you could kind of bring adversaries across the table and get them to agree to each other and agree with to get them to agree with each other and, uh, achieve social progress.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Was that a deep seated belief of his or was that in a certain sense, a tactic? Not a cynical tactic, but a tactic and a, I would be very with him if it were a way of thinking about politics. If the war, a tactic, because the job of a transformative leader is not too huge the center, but to define their own values as the center as common sense. And uh, if he, you know, I, I believe in the agenda he's passed, he's, he's putting far, for example, universal healthcare, for example, a cap and trade and green jobs as a way to solve our energy problems while growing the economy. I think these are reasonable a while liberal goals and uh, if he presents them as reasonable and the reaction to them as one could knew they were going to be because there are these millions of people that don't consider a liberal president.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Legitimate was irrational extreme that presented him an opportunity to say, my program is rational, but my opposition has chosen extremism has chosen on reason and be willing to take the hit that there's always going to be a minority of the country. Thirty percent, 35 percent, even 40 percent who disagrees with him radically disagrees with him strongly. But if he's still willing to pass his program with that 60 percent margin, the rest of the country will eventually catch up. The reaction notice will understand as they did with social security, as they did with women getting the vote, freeing the slaves, you know, social security that actually these things were in their interests. They'll accept them as part of the established order of American society. And in fact, 20, 30, 40 years years down the road, the Republicans and the Conservatives will be campaigning to save universal healthcare, just like a campaign to save social security.

Speaker 1:          03:14          But the problem is this doesn't really work unless you make this kind of tactical shift. If people say that you're illegitimate and your liberal agenda is extremist socialist, uh, destroying the America that we all grew up with, you have to be willing to say this is unreasonable. This is extreme. And if you aren't able to say this is unreasonable and this is extreme, then you're granting your opposition a undue influence. You're basically negotiating with the UN negotiator bubble. And, uh, as Abraham Lincoln said quite eloquently in his 18, 60 speech at Cooper Union, uh, you can't win that way.

Speaker 1:          04:02          I've been saying for years that, you know, there are millions of Americans who basically don't consider, uh, the liberal project legitimate. They consider it the opposite of what America means to them and, uh, that they derive their identity from questioning the legitimacy and the ability of liberal government to, to function peacefully. So, uh, I think that for a couple months, uh, even more maybe six months, uh, Barack Obama's charisma and his, um, his remarkable popularity, a kind of stunned, some of these people into silence think people couldn't quite believe what they're saying. But if you, if you, if you, if you look at it historically, it's quite continuous with what happened when Bill Clinton became president. You know, when you began to hear people accusing him of murdering his aids. You know, when you began to have, uh, people, uh, saying that he was actually a agent for the Soviet Union, which he had visited when he was a child or when he was a teenager when he was in college.

Speaker 1:          05:09          And you saw the same thing when Jimmy Carter became president and, uh, you know, um, he was immediately considered a part of this, uh, corrupt Democratic Party establishment. Uh, it happened every time a Democrat was elected and it will happen. Every time a Democrat is elected, it's part of our patrimony as Americans. And the challenge for a Barack Obama or any democrat or any liberal is to understand that this is just part of who we are as Americans to acknowledge it, to respect it, and to transcend it. And, uh, you know, the lion can lay down with the lamb, but it's not going to last for very long.

Speaker 1:          05:58          Well, tactically the, the threat of, by conservatives, by social conservatives, by the conservative movement as they call themselves, based in Washington, based in, you know, uh, places like northern Virginia, uh, to form a new party has always been this kind of bluff designed to, uh, you know, bend the Republican Party to their will. And uh, you know, it's, it's, it's usually worked because the media reports it seriously except for, in the American context, you know, third parties very rarely work. We have a winner take all system, so you know, the minute, say wichard Viguerie who threatens to create a third party, you know, every four or eight years because he claims that the conservatives in power aren't really conservative. If he really did it, he would immediately be surrendering all his influence in national discussions. So that's not really a serious threat. Um, the division between, let's say a corporate conservatives and religious conservatives is fascinating, interesting, rich and complex.

Speaker 1:          07:00          I mean, one of the ways it worked was that traditionally not traditionally, basically, one of the ways that evolved in the 19 seventies was that people who wanted a business who wanted a more laissez faire, less regulation, more control over government, more of say a cronyism stake and what government was actually doing, um, saw things like the Heritage Foundation, the Christian coalition, the moral majority as opportunities for them to form a coalition. Um, if you give it a generous interpretation or aggrandized their power, if you give it a little more cynical interpretation. So you get these fascinating moments like this. A war in West Virginia in 1974 by religious conservatives to, uh, to kick a heathen textbooks out of the schools that were sort of supposedly imposed by religious bureaucrats. It was a very local issue. It was a very localized, struggled. It had a lot to do with the way politics works in West Virginia where you have this kind of history of insurgent violence from coal miners.

Speaker 1:          08:04          Um, and you get these conservative business conservatives in Washington at the Heritage Foundation realizing that this is an organizing opportunity for them. The Heritage Foundation sends representatives down to West Virginia and helps put these people in touch with national ideological, large entrepreneurs with people like Richard Viguerie. And that's how a coalition forms that basically creates foot soldiers for an agenda that the West Virginia religious conservatives may or may not be supporting, but eventually they'll come to support. Um, and uh, it's, there's, there's, there's both an inherent tension and instability in it, but there's also within American protestantism, a real strain of pro capitalism. And so it's, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting, it's rich, it's tense. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work, it's, and right now we're, you know, at a real knife's edge about whether it's going to work or whether it's going to fall apart.

Speaker 1:          09:11          The CEO of a say in Aerospace Corporation might not want to have anything to do with a demonic possession, you know, uh, in pentecostal churches, um, but you know, he needs the people who have those great passions in order to kind of anchor the conservative coalition. So the question is, when have they created a Frankenstein's monster whenever they created something that, uh, they can't control. You're seeing more and more indications, a buy from conservatives have, you know, that kind of embarrassment. And I was out the other night and a West Point Grad, a banker friend, uh, who's a conservative, he called himself the country club conservative and said, I have nothing to do with those Sarah Pailin people. Well, the problem is, without those Sarah Pailin people, the Republicans would never win an election. So, you know, they find themselves on the horns of a dilemma. And, uh, the ideological entrepreneurs on the religious right who, you know, uh, let's face it, have an interest in a grandizing their power and their control, uh, don't really have any incentive to, um, to modify or moderate their positions.

Speaker 1:          10:24          In fact, they're more likely to aggrandized their power and their influence by, uh, by maintaining a front of purity. So you know that, that, that speaks to the whole tension and paradox behind the conservative project right now, all the people who have ascended to positions of power and leadership in rush lumbar is a perfect example, even though he pretty much unites the religious and a business, conservatives pretty seamlessly, um, have achieved their influence, have achieved their power through a certain kind of cultural style based on their willingness to say that compromise is inherently bad. And that gets back to the question of whether Obama can negotiate with the 20 million people who listened to rush limbaugh everyday and consider any compromise, compromise a betrayal of America's promise itself. Right? So there's no incentive for a rush limbaugh to change because this is what's given him this, you know, these 20 million listeners, you know, his, his mansion that has a, you know, a replica of the hall of mirrors at Versailles. So when, um, you know, uh, the Republican National Committee or a train of a conservative Republicans who wish to moderate the image of their party to make it seem more centrist and palatable to swing voters, try and do that, rush limbaugh is able to not merely survive but thrive by disdaining them.

Speaker 1:          11:58          Healthcare is a fascinating example of this question of how religious conservatives and business conservatives can act in coalition. You know, I'm being on the, uh, the, the, the mailing list of, uh, you know, the American Family Association, Don Wildman Organization. I'm beginning to get the emails saying that know healthcare. Uh, they, that, you know, basically national national healthcare program is imposition on Christians. You know, it's going to do a fund abortions. It's going to have a, violate the sanctity of the traditional family. So you see a pure example of kind of a right wing libertarian business, conservatives, uh, using, uh, the leaders of the religious right in a quite an effective way, uh, to, you know, undermine a mass constituency for reform, which in the end is actually quite conservative. I mean, what could be more, you know, uh, what, what could be more judicious then, you know, like I said, letting people change their jobs, uh, if they have an entrepreneurial idea, what could be more strengthening of the traditional bonds of family and society, then families not going bankrupt because someone in the family gets sick.

Speaker 1:          13:15          Um, but, um, you know, there are very powerful interests, uh, who, uh, you know, basically benefit from the status quo and they're able to take advantage of this preexisting, a deep distrust, a that's, you know, very American of anything having to do with an expanding state. And again, historically it's the same thing you saw was social security. It's the same thing you saw with Medicare. It's the same thing you saw with the idea that the United States in the 19th century should have a central bank. You know, the same thing you saw when the government began talking about financing internal improvements like canals, uh, the interstates, you know, which were seen as a communist plot by some people. Uh, so, um, the challenge for progressives, the challenge for people who believe that this is, uh, not only, uh, uh, an important goal, but an imperative goal. National healthcare is a not to imagine that this kind of irrational fear is going to go away, but simply to both through it forced healthcare down people's throats, whether they, whether they like it or not, and watch what happens 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now when again, conservatives come to power, promising to, uh, to uphold the ideals of a Obama's healthcare program.

Speaker 1:          14:45          Just like George Bush promised to uphold social security and promised to honor Fdr. And, uh, just like, uh, conservatives have any gender, every generation or I should say reactionaries advantage. Every generation say, well, the liberals that we're dealing with now are unacceptable extremists. Uh, the ones we had last generation weren't so bad.

Speaker 1:          15:10          I don't see it over the horizon. And Reagan is a perfect example of someone who simultaneously, you know, kind of honored the impulses of this grassroots, right, but also kind of massage them and also treated them like a politician, treats a member of it's coalition, like Franklin Roosevelt treated the unions are Lyndon Johnson, you know, treated, uh, the civil rights movement and the consumer rights movement. Ronald Reagan was able to basically massage the concerns of the pro life movement without ever giving a speech to them without ever granting them any major policy concessions while able to, you know, being able to, um, place, uh, their acolytes in positions of relative powerlessness, powerlessness, symbolic positions, you know, things like smaller ambassadorships, independent government commissions. And, uh, with his criticism and skill, he was able to, uh, mitigate the kinds of tensions that created. And there were tensions, you know, early in the eighties, George will was one, Richard Viguerie was another.

Speaker 1:          16:18          There were a lot of conservatives saying that Ronald Reagan is betraying conservatism, which tend to happens whenever a conservative president is politically unsuccessful. Conservatism never fails. It is only failed. They'll say that, uh, Ronald Reagan or George Bush. It fails because they're not conservative and that sentiment lasts for as long as they're politically unsuccessful. But George Bush, it's, you know, every other day you hear a conservative say, well, the reason he failed was he wasn't conservative enough. Well, the problem with that is a George W Bush brought to Washington, uh, alongside a, for most of his term, a majority conservative congress and quite conservative judiciary, an entire movement, entire set of institutions and entire bureaucracy that conservatives have built up, you know, in the years since Barry Goldwater. So when George Bush is president, he is not just a acting independently, but he's acting for the figurehead, for, you know, an enormous movement that was able to insinuates itself, uh, up and down in the bureaucracy and up and down the political chain.

Speaker 1:          17:29          So that's where the blame asked to lie. Now with George Bush, those kinds of people I come across once in a generation and you can't pick them out of a catalog and they can kind of tend to come from surprising places, you know, certainly, you know, 19, 62 when Ronald Reagan was, you know, it's washed up act going around from Ge, planted Ge plant, given patriotic speeches. No one saw that it was him. You know, I don't see who it is, but if I saw how it was then you know, I'd be a, you know, a genius political consultant or I'd be a great leader myself. I mean a leaders see things in the public will that are often invisible to the rest of us mere mortals.

Speaker 1:          18:16          There will always be an American conservatism. It's completely continuous. You know, throughout our history, it has its own shifts and changes and evolutions in some positions. You know, that helped in the past. It doesn't hold now and some positions that holds, holds, it holds now, it didn't hold in the past. You know, for example, you know the concern, if you're a conservative in the 19 thirties, you're known as someone who didn't believe in foreign military intervention, right? You were fighting against the idea that America should rearm for World War II. Now, of course, uh, you know, conservatives are the people who are most likely to, you know, call for a huge defense establishment and be more eager to kind of go on overseas adventures, but something having to do with individualism, having to do with sort of this fetishization of the nuclear family and traditional values having to do with the belief that a businessman's republic kind of run a bind for businessman who's a benevolence, kind of trickles down to ordinary people.

Speaker 1:          19:10          That's always been a part of American political culture. And it always will be. I mean, the challenge for progressives is just to, you know, put together a coalition to make sure that, um, you know, the conservative coalition, uh, doesn't have enough power to, to, I would say a push through their agenda. But it's often the case that they don't have an agenda. I mean, there really is no conservative theory of government as we saw for especially the first six years of the Bush administration in which, you know, basically had, you know, conservative hammerlock on the forces of the state and all they were able to really do was a weekend, you know, the state weaken our ability to collectively solve our problems together.

Speaker 1:          19:58          Well, among conservatives saying, your libertarian is always been a way to say, uh, I believe in everything having to do with conservatism except the embarrassing stuff now except the stuff except the, you know, the spiritual warfare casting out demons from certain zip codes, which was, you know, a big part of Ted Haggard's paradigm. And the church, the Pentecostal Church that, uh, Sarah Pailin is involved with. Um, so it's always been a more of a gesture than anything else. Of course, the people who call themselves libertarians within the Republican party at least had been quite willing to go along with, you know, these kind of violations of civil liberties. They have kind of gone along with the war on terrorism. Although there are, you know, genuine libertarians on the right who have been actually quite heroic, you know, at preserving the principles of civil liberties, um, you know, on a, among Democrats, among liberals who find themselves a enraptured by the concepts of libertarianism.

Speaker 1:          20:59          Um, it's not as good a fit. I mean, some, some folks have been talking now about libertarian, liberal Terry aneurysm, which is the idea that liberalism can be stripped of its kind of paternalistic elements and a respect the autonomy people better. Well, the problem with that is that's always been the ideal of liberalism and liberalism at it's best and the Democratic Party and its most mature form has, uh, always, uh, you know, attempted to create the maximum amount of equality alongside the maximum amount of freedom. Now it's something that's often an honored only in the breach because that's the hardest thing for human societies to be able to accomplish. But, you know, I mean, the, the liberal vision, you know, dovetails with what's called in the rest of the world social democracy, which is that you can't really enjoy anything, uh, like liberty unless you have some minimum standard of living, you know, unless you're free to change jobs, uh, if you hate your boss and you're not afraid of losing your health insurance, you know, that's neither paternalistic, you know, uh, nor is it a socialistic. It's entrepreneurial, right? So that's, you know, that's, that's, you know, straight down the center of liberalism and, um, that's something a libertarian would reject because it involves expanding the role for the state. But a liberal at its best understands that sometimes expanding the state can actually enhance liberty in pretty profound ways.
