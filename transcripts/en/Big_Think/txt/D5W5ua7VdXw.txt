Speaker 1:          00:10          My opinion on the legalization of marijuana is complicated because when we think about a society in general, if we think about these things, honestly, every society has. They're intoxicated, we have alcohol, that's our primary, what we also have to mackle and we have caffeine which is not as intoxicated. Now the question becomes, should we make another intoxicant legal that we know all the problems that we have with those with alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine, we know the problems that we may have, so that means if you have marijuana to be more widely available, you can also expect to maybe have some more problems. Some of those similar types of problems. On the one hand, on the other hand, in New York City for example, we're arresting hundreds of thousands of people every year for marijuana and they have they as a result, they have a record or they have some sort of blemish and that might retard their ability to make a contribution.

Speaker 1:          01:13          So we are also having some consequences from our current legal status of the drug. So the society has to balance what is more important to the society, but they should do so with their eyes open. You will have problems either way, but the point becomes which problems are we willing to tolerate as a society on the one hand, now that's the legalization issue that you're talking about. That's more availability. Now, when we think about medical marijuana, um, the institute on medicine, um, did a report, still tried to study this issue comprehensively and suggested that we should probably continue to investigate therapeutic potential, the therapeutic potential of marijuana and that's clearly support that position that we certainly need to, if people are suffering and we have potential medications that will help relieve their suffering, absolutely we should go full forth with that and we should do it in a responsible way in which, uh, in a similar way in which we look at, uh, in which we use drugs like morphine, which is essentially heroin. Um, we, we do that responsibly. Um, and we certainly do it in a restricted and controlled manner. And we should probably do the same with marijuana.
