Speaker 1:          00:08          Modest. I think one thing we've learned over the last eight,

Speaker 2:          00:13          the obvious one is you can't bring democracy at the barrel of a gun. I mean I think people would have known that in the first place that even the Bush people don't say that they, they, that's what they sought to do though. It's sure it looks like that's what they sought to do. The point is what can you do? What can any outside act or including the United States do to try to bring more democratic outcomes in countries? And I think there's, I, I tend to talk about it as a kind of high thing in a low thing. The low thing which happens with nobody particularly noticing it is the slow effort at building up institutions. The state building part of this, and, and this is a key aspect, but a, a very gradual listic one where you try to help countries with issues of rule of law and transparency and limiting corruption as well as helping to build infrastructure and so forth.

Speaker 2:          01:01          That's the low thing, the high thing and the dramatic thing. Well, these are public diplomatic acts. So how can the United States make a difference there? Well, there are some times when elections are enormously consequential and it really matters a lot for the United States to come down on the right side. Uh, we saw recently in Pakistan and the United States was on the wrong side and the democratic civilian secular parties succeeded anyway. So it shows the limits of our power for bad as well as for good. But there are moments when are these enormously important for the United States to say there was a democratic side and there is a not democratic side, well, less democratic.

Speaker 1:          01:40          And we stand with the devil to take eight an example, which I think is not the space you hear people say, Oh, in the Middle East we have a tradition of Islamic democracy. We call it the shoe off,

Speaker 2:          01:56          which is to say a council of elders who together reach a consensual conclusion. Well, that's not a democracy. That does not represent the will of the people. And especially in a complex society, uh, as opposed to a tribal society. Uh, sure. Art will not be a, a useful reflection of people's will and will not be sufficiently accountable to them and will not be counterbalanced by other powers as well. So there's an example where I would say the local customs don't get you there, or the lawyer Jirga in Afghanistan, they're very important transitional devices, but they're not the thing itself. At the same time, uh, there are lots of elements of things like how power is divided between the center and the locality, where the United States has a particular way of doing it that's very different from our western other Western democracies, much less in other African countries. They are systems of, of adjudicating a more traditional systems of, of, of the, of justice, for example, which can waive alongside more western systems of justice. So incredibly, there is not a one size fits all aspect of democracy, but it's a big mistake to think that it's so variable that there are not a series of quite fundamental practices, values institutions, which aren't as essential for anybody.
