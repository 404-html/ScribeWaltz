Speaker 1:          00:13          Of course, I had spiritual moments in a bland sense of that word. And I suppose, but I think the right sense, I have times when I am just transported with awe and joy and a sense of peace and wonder at whether it's music or art or, or, or just a child playing or some other wonderful thing off. And my sail boat, uh, being amazed at the beauty of the ocean. Uh, I think that people make the mistake of thinking that spirituality in that sense has anything to do with either a religious doctrines or with immateriality or the supernatural. Uh, the world is a stunningly interesting and glorious place and at every scale and the are that one can experience because one understands something about how the parts are put together is I think far greater than the sort of, or of incomprehension. Just I think, I think it's, the universe is much more wonderful the more you know about how it's put together.

Speaker 1:          01:35          Of course, we can change our brains, uh, through meditation. Uh, um, you can change your brain through, through doing crossword puzzles or, or, or reading a novel or through meditating or through running. Uh, brains are stunningly adjustable plastic, uh, organs and everything you do, it changes your brain a little bit. Uh, otherwise you couldn't leave a trace of what you do. He couldn't have any memory. Uh, so meditation is one actually very good way of changing your brand. I think meditation plays some of the roles that are played also by sleep of restoring balance, uh, uh, getting rid of tension and access and generally calming the whole system down so that it can confront the world anew. It's a sort of a refreshment.
