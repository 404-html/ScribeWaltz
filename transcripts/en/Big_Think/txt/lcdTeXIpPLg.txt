Speaker 1:          00:06          Culture is, uh, frankly, um, one of the reasons why many of the developing nations of the world continue to kind of depend on handouts for the, because they do not have an agricultural infrastructure that allows them to be self sufficient in food production is, and, and in the area of global trade, um, we really do not have very much free trade and agriculture because it's an interesting phenomena. No matter how, no matter how rich or country is, most farmers will want to protect what they have inside. It's as true of America. It's true of the UK, it's true of Europe. It's true of China's true of everywhere else. So agriculture is probably the reason why we cannot move very aggressively on a new global trade round. The agricultural interests are, are pretty down on.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Well, I think in the area of agriculture, uh, you know, uh, what we as a nation have to do this after recognize that vast areas of the world has subsistence agriculture and our policies tend to hurt that because of the way we subsidize our products. I don't want to make an overall statement because some are more in that area than an than others. And not every one of our programs is bad. But, um, agriculture is unique. The politics of agriculture is unlike any in the rest of the world. You can be talking to the most liberal, progressive politician in America or Japan or in Europe on anything else. And you mentioned dairy or cotton or sugar, and it's like they turned from Dr Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It's just, it's just the way of the world and has probably always been that way. And part of it is this natural predilection to protect your farmers and your food supply.
