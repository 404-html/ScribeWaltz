Speaker 1:          00:08          So one of the great things about a civilization is that there's a whole bunch of different people. All the different people have different, are curious about different things and somehow if they all follow their own curiosity in some way, great stuff happens. That's sort of what's happened so far. I mean, if you're in a civilization where you're able to support people doing that, then uh, the civilization feels you feel happier to be in it. I mean, when I read about something that, whether it's art or biology or sociology, if I read about something interesting and I realize that some humans actually spent their whole life doing that and it's, and that we supported them doing it, I f I feel like that's the, the, the pinnacle of civilization that's the best. So I think, you know, one of the reasons we fund these experiments, um,

Speaker 1:          01:12          is because we want to live in a world where people find stuff out. Imagine if you funded nothing in science and you never found anything out. How depressing would that be? I don't know actually. How depressing would that be that that would be pretty depressing. Or imagine a world in which nobody could write books or, yeah, I think the reason to fund things, and you can, of course, you can't argue that any stupid thing you should fund, but if there's a whole lot of people who are interested in doing something and it makes sense and they've worked on it for years, it's reasonable to fund it. I think if you can, I mean, there's some people who believe that, you know, you should only fund things that make people's lives longer, but that seems ridiculous. How about making people's lives better? How about people making people happier to be alive because they can read cool stuff in the New York Times or whatever, wherever in science. So this, so people are somehow moralistic about the length of people's lives rather than the quality of life or the rather than the standard of living. So I think by me doing particle physics, it raises everybody's standard of living. That's a,

Speaker 2:          02:21          okay

Speaker 1:          02:21          boy, maybe I shouldn't be quoted that way, I think. I think I do that.
