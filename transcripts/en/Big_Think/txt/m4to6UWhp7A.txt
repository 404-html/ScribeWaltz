Speaker 1:          00:08          Britain, Britain,

Speaker 2:          00:08          Britain had a real problem in the 1990s because it basically allowed a number of radical clerics, especially for very key crap clerics to operate within the country. Um, Abu Hamza, I was one of them, advocate tater and other Omar Bakri another and these clerics were allow us to operate, um, to give Simon's, to radicalize youngsters, to travel up and down the country, address thousands of followers and some of those followers then join up with, with, with al Qaeda became involved in suicide bombings, um, cause real problems to the British authorities in the period afterwards. And certainly by either expelling some of them or imprisoning other others of them that that problem has been reduced. The radicals now being driven much more underground in the United Kingdom at which, which poses all sorts of other concerns, but at least there isn't this a radical message being put out in the open anymore, um, in the UK.

Speaker 2:          01:09          And so that, that, that, that has changed the, the, the climate too to a degree in the United Kingdom. Um, and you're starting really to see a push back against the radicals amongst, um, all sorts of constituencies within the Muslim community. Um, people who, who wants, had some sympathy, um, with, uh, some of archive has goals in the very least, and now going around mosque and they're saying, you know, don't be any part of this, this, this ideology is not Islamic. And, and said, you're seeing people, um, who were once involved with some of these movements now tony against them and I sort of push back happening against the radicals. And the key thing there was the July seven, 2005 alcaide or attack on the London subway system, which really woke up a lot of them was in community, um, in, in, in Britain to the threat of alcaide are, and turn some people who add at least a little bit of sympathy with what some of our Kyler was doing around the world.

Speaker 2:          02:06          And certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan, a away from the organization. Uh, it was a sort of polarizing a event. Um, it's, it, it really turned vast majority of Muslims fully against al Qaeda in the country. Um, but of course, the people who were already radicalized, some of them became a even more fervently radicalized by that event, energized by that event. Certainly, um, the, the four suicide bombers, uh, amongst the small radical fringe of seen as heroes. I've, I've had people come up to me and say, Mahabir city ECOM is a blessing. Marta. Um, you know, who's going to go to paradise? That they see him as an example. Some of them unfortunately, might want to follow in his footsteps. Um, but for the vast majority of Muslims, and even for some wisdom to had some sympathy for some of Alcaide as goals, um, that was an event really made them wake up and turn against, um, the, the radicals. Uh, so July seven was very important, uh, in London, um, in really, um, starting up or off an opposition against this ideology. Um, and, and, um,

Speaker 3:          03:12          changing the climate.
