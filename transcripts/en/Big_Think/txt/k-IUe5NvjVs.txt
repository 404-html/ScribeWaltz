Speaker 1:          00:04          A lot of people have talked about China's growing role in Africa. I personally am not a particularly either upset or surprised by this because realistically what's going on is simply the increased role that China is playing in the globe at large, uh, as you would expect a growing economic power, uh, to play, uh, and it's focused on resource plays. It's focused on buying up and securing energy sources and materials and various things that will fuel the continued growth of the Chinese economy. Uh, and it's exactly what you'd expect. It certainly has some adverse consequences because since the Chinese don't care about various kinds of human rights issues and they don't care about political freedoms, they're more than happy to deal with dictators. They're more than happy to overlook all sorts of trouble if it, if there are particular immediate needs are taken care of, but you know what, in the long run, the Chinese might well find that stability and sustainably healthy, viable local communities and, and policies are in their best interest as well.
