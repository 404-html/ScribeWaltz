Speaker 1:          00:07          Aesthetic evolution, animals are agents in their own evolution. That is it through their choices, they ended up shaping their own species. One of the implications of this idea is a new perspective on what happens when mate choice is infringed or violated by sexual violence or by a coercion in, uh, in animal species. Uh, one prominent example of this from our own research is on duck sex. A ducks are, uh, uh, unusual among birds in having both a, a, a, a, a, a typical mate choice situation where male and females pair up on the basis of display and preferences and simultaneously other individuals that forced copulations on, on a female docs as the approach reproduction. So what that means is that, uh, as the eggs were being laid, females have to defend themselves from a forced copulations by males. Now, forced population is the word that biologists use now, but force over a century.

Speaker 1:          01:18          A biologist used the word rape in biology. Now that was abandoned back in the 19 seventies in response to the feminist movement. And Susan Brown Miller and her work a against our will, uh, proposing and articulating a specifically a social context for a rape in humans. This led to the creation of a euphemism forced copulation in biology. Unfortunately, articulating a sexual violence in the animal world with these euphemistic terms has led to scientists losing track of the fact that forced copulation is against the will of the ducks. And by taking the aesthetic perspective and trying to understand what it is that individual females in this case, stocks want. A, we have arrived at a, a new perspective on what it means when they don't get what they want, right? So in some ways, uh, uh, using, uh, socially sensitive euphemisms has led to a, a precision or fuzziness in, in the science.

Speaker 1:          02:31          In the case of ducks x. What we find is that males can force themselves on females because they are among the few birds that still have a penis. Uh, and, uh, uh, what we find in docs is the, as a result of a female resistance and male sexual violence, we find a, a, a coevolution, a arms race between male, a capacity to force and female resistance. In this case, it takes place in the form of a genital arms race. The males evolve, a more elaborate and more elaborately armed penises. And the females evolve convoluted vaginal morphologies that exclude the penis during forced copulations. So the, uh, among the many weird things that a duck penis is, is that they're counterclockwise, coiled, uh, well, the female, a vagina in ducks that have a high rates of resistance actually coils in the opposite direction. So they have literally evolved in it screwed device, uh, in their vaginal track that, that ubs a, obstructs the intermission of the penis during forced copulation.

Speaker 1:          03:40          Um, what that means is that the, uh, what that tea party, Senator Kennedy, Todd Akin from Missouri said, uh, about, uh, women have a way of shutting that whole thing down in reference to, to rape is actually true of ducks. But in a way that exposes something fundamentally new and interesting about evolutionary biology, which is that sexual autonomy matters to animals. Freedom of choice is not merely a political concept in discovered by a suffragettes and feminists in the 19th and 20th centuries, but it's actually an evolved feature of the social and sexual lives of other species, especially in docs. How does this work? Well, if the female mates with the male she prefers, that is she gets the green had in the quack, quack, quack that she likes, and then her male offspring will share that those traits and be sexually preferred by other female docs who have coevolved those same aesthetic preferences.

Speaker 1:          04:41          But if she's forcibly fertilized, then her male offspring will either inherit a random trade or one that she specifically rejected, which means that her offspring will be less attractive to other females. So anything that female duck can do to prevent force fertilization through physical resistance or behavior will evolve because she will be rewarded with more grandkids. Right? So what this means is that a aesthetic norms, these shared ideas about what is beautiful among ducks gives female ducks the evolutionary leverage to advance their freedom of choice in the environment of persistent, a sexual coercion and sexual violence, right? Uh, this is really stunning. In fact, we know these ducks are so successful because in species were 40 or 50 percent of the populations are forced, only two to five percent of the eggs in the nest are fathered by males who are not the social partner.

Speaker 1:          05:45          What that means is that females have a 98 percent a successful, uh, birth control device. That is a behavior of Lee, a deployable in the vaginal tract in response to sexual violence, right? That's like FDA approvable, right? And what that shows is the power of female choice to advance, uh, the sexual autonomy of individual females. One of the interesting things we learned from, uh, examining, um, uh, sexual conflict in docs is that, uh, the genital arms race between males and females is not really a fair fight. In fact, uh, the advances in feet in male coercive capacity are really about control over a female outcomes, right? They are about controlling, physically controlling a fertilization. However, the countermeasures that females evolve are not actually about power or control. They merely reestablish a, uh, the, the, the freedom of choice, if you will, the flat playing field in which individuals are free to choose who they like right now, this, this sexual autonomy is not actually about a control or control over other people's, uh, or over other individuals, uh, sexual outcomes.

Speaker 1:          07:17          That's fascinating because this is a cemetery between, uh, a male, male coercion and female resistance in duck sex, uh, has really fascinating parallels to a, um, a patriarchy and feminism in cultures today. So, for example, a patriarchy is historically and even in a modern sense about coercive control, uh, over female reproductive autonomy, uh, whereas feminism is a really an ideology of freedom of choice, right? And that's so that same cemetery between male power and, uh, and freedom of choice a is elaborate and present today. And we can see this explicitly because patriarchy and a men's rights, uh, and in cell a movements all articulate feminism as a countervailing force have control over a male reproductive outcomes. Uh, but that's a fantasy. In fact, uh, the, the sexual autonomy includes the freedom to be rejected at which, uh, uh, is, uh, a lesson that we learned from duck sex.
