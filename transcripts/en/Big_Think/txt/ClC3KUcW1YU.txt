Speaker 1:          00:05          Barry's a country was opened in 19 million population in a country with a long history, very rich culture, and unfortunately some of the production practices and enormous affect women and negatively in the practice of Lfr, which is a abducting girls for marriage, is one of the harmful practices that affect other physical and mental, uh, as with less social economic lives of women in Ethiopia.

Speaker 2:          01:04          Mm, okay.

Speaker 1:          01:42          I heard about the story on the radio. Uh, uh, I was, I was in a car with a driver and we were listening to radio and, uh, the, the, there was a media coverage about 14 years old girls being abducted and raped and killing her would be husband. So as soon as I, um, learned about story, I immediately thought that we should be going to this place which is 300 kilometers outside our discipline, our where we work and we should be able to defend the code. I thought about this because, uh, I believe that, uh, we should save her life because she was a facing like a life sentence. And secondly, also, I knew that this is going to be a big case precedent setting case, which we'll see we could use for public education to, uh, you know, it has the dialogue and the conversation around, um, abduction around that

Speaker 2:          03:12          onto and asked you kind of got him uncle.

Speaker 1:          03:53          For some people, especially people living in the West is completely outside their experience. Uh, in that sense, it's really educate, educate people or uh, you know, uh, how women live in the other part of the world lit. Secondly, it's also a call to action. Uh, I believe, um, education been a women's rights organizations and, uh, um, government and then government and institutions whose mandate focus on gender equality, uh, would like to use this field to, for advocacy for a ligand reform and to sort of enhance and accelerate, um, uh, programs, uh, towards, uh, especially, uh, uh, fighting child marriage around the world. Like that's my hope. Getting Angelina Jolie was quite helpful. The movie, the content history, uh, the presentation is fantastic, but her are going to be the executive producer of really give, took it to another label, to another height. And, uh, I think that's what was kind of a highlight, but I will path.

Speaker 1:          05:22          I'm good. I'm on Jay and Martha, I think this film is quite educational because it does not necessarily judge the community. It does not necessarily, uh, you know, sort of point the finger desert community, it sort of shows, you know, where the thinking comes from. It's sort of a mixture you to have a conversation with yourself because it makes, it, makes you, it's not that easy a sort of a sin, uh, because this people, they have lived half lived was a practitioner for a number of years and that's what they know. That's what they believe from time to time, we need to go back to the drawing board and we need to have a real conversation on why these things are happening. It's not enough to say, well, it's a culture where it's a tradition we need to discuss about, unpack and to discuss about why this is happening.
