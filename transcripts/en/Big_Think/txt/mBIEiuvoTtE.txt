Speaker 1:          00:00          I wanted to write about what it means that some people see me, they have to earn or have to do something to deserve access to. Things that we think about is basic necessity. So how hard can you work to earn access to a meal every night or like earn or what do you have to do to deserve a good education? What do you have to do to deserve to have housing and that's one of the ways that race sort of works in this country is that there's some people that are deemed inherently worthy. So we think about the way whiteness and white supremacy people are just deemed white people are just deemed worthy of things, but there's this notion that you need to work extra hard to deserve a great public education. I am from Baltimore and we think about the school system in Baltimore City is not funded equitably at all and it's like, well, what do those kids have to do to like earn equitable funding?

Speaker 1:          00:48          They actually don't need to do anything besides just be alive and one of the things that we need to do is make sure that we set up a system where people just have the basic necessities like food, water, education. We can guarantee that there's no reason why we don't have it here. So I actually think about the diversity and equality and equity, right? The equality is everybody gets the same thing. Equity is that people get what they need and deserve. And then the worker justice, we are almost always fighting for equity. So we think about things like school funding. We are not asking for equal funding. We know that it just costs more to educate kids who grew up in poverty. It costs more to educate kids with special needs and we know that we need to pay that cost, that those kids deserve. That we're not saying that every kid, uh, it costs the same to educate every kid.

Speaker 1:          01:27          That's just not true. We want a world of equity where people get what they need and deserve. We know the disparities around criminal justice, that there are disparities around race and we want an equitable system that doesn't penalize people for where they live, how they show up, what zip code they come from. So the difference between equity and equality as an important distinction and the only way to get to equality equality and access, how whatever metric of equality you want is by having equity of resources, right? Equity of experiences. I did the equity pieces that you need something different and you deserve something different. And from a system level I'm going to make sure that you have access to that. So I was talking to somebody about about who's named Swanson a and she was like, people should have to work for food stamps because if they work for it though dignity and I'm like, you know, not eating.

Speaker 1:          02:12          I think it's pretty addictive. Like not having food is a lack of dignity right there, right? That like food is one of those basic things. We have enough food that we can beat everybody. We have enough water to everybody can, you know, have a, a meal at three meals every single day. Like we can guarantee those things. We don't need to artificially create this requirement that people like work so they can earn food, like we can actually guarantee these basic things for people, uh, in one of the things that we have to do as we fight for social justice, as talk about these things as basic as they are, the, it's not radical to believe that we can live in a world with the police. Don't kill people. It's not radical to say that every kid should be able to read and write. It's not radical or extreme to say that we can feed every single person every single day.

Speaker 1:          02:55          That the only radical thing about it is that we have to say in the first place like, that is actually where the radical part comes in. And we, I think about that because polarization thrives in a world of extremes. And so often people want to paint our positions is extreme. It's an extreme position to say that there should be equity advantage. That's not extreme. The extreme thing about it is that we don't have it right now and that we have defined for it. I was in a meeting once and we were talking about welfare and it was people from the right and the left and one of her sort of, there was a person in it who was sort of against welfare and her push was like, you know, people need to, people need to like earn it. People need to work hard for it and if they work hard for it they'll feel better and it's like A.

Speaker 1:          03:37          I don't know. I think that people like have already worked hard to like get a meal. I think that people being alive, it's like enough of that and there's some people who feel like they just deserve everything. They're like. One of the ways that white supremacy works is that people really do feel like they've already earned. They put in the hard work, they've done something or the, all the, all the things that they get are actually the benefits of their hard work. You think about the way wealth works in this country is that in 2023, the median wealth for black people's gonna be $0. The lowest recorded. It's since you've been recording about them this way and you didn't go to the median wealth of $0 and you think about white wealth, which is will be around $100,000 in the medium. Black walls will be zero.

Speaker 1:          04:14          Is that. It sounds like why people like worked hard for that. It's not like white people, like every white person was like some entrepreneur that like did all these wealth building things. The government literally gave white people. Well, the government gave white people housing loans for very little with very little interest in government gave white people land. The highway administration created the suburbs and you think about what it means that the government gave people a. gave white people like education in mass, like those things contributed to white wealth, but there are. People were like, I worked really hard and say, how hard did you work for a system that just like benefits your skin colored every turn of the way you didn't do that, you know? How hard did you work for every band aid to look like you? How hard did you work for nude to be the color of your skin and not mine?

Speaker 1:          04:57          Like you didn't do that. A system did that and like that. You benefit from the system and part of the work of white people is to understand the privilege of whiteness and to understand how a system provided that and work to dismantle it and actually is dangerous a teacher. So there's a study that came out that was the first time measures, how meritocracy impacts middle schoolers and it's like a seventh grade in seventh grade kids and it shows that kids actually kids of color do worse later if they believe that meritocracy is like a real thing because the systems are to bear down on them in hallways. They think that it's a result of like dumb, just not working hard, and it's like, no, we know that the way systemic racism shows up later like means that no matter how gifted you are, how great you are, the outcome still just aren't the same. We know what the criminal justice here you think about New York City, that 90 percent of the people arrested for marijuana are black and brown. You and I both know that the 90 percent of the people in New York City smoking weed or not black or brown. When we think about the arrests, we think about disparities in education. The meritocracy causes people to blame themselves for outcomes and not realizing that the system is almost guaranteeing instead of outcomes.
