Speaker 1:          00:00          Billing errors almost invariably are to our disadvantage. It's so stunning. One feels so blessed. One feels so Leprechaun pod of Goldie defines a billing error in our favor that the temptation to take advantage of it. It's pretty potent but don't yield to it. Here's the essential point. It's not right to profit from someone else's innocent error and in your own life. If you drop your wallet on the street, you expect people to return it with the cash in it. Someone's innocent error is not meant to be a profit making opportunity that we have a kind of civic duty to play our part, to return the lost property, to point out when the door to the bank has been left ajar, not to simply exploited. I wouldn't want to live in that kind of world. So in this case, you can't exploit an innocent air. Even Time Warner's, even though you may have harsh feelings about a person or an entity, you don't sacrifice your moral values when you're dealing with him that his good conduct doesn't just flow to people.

Speaker 1:          01:04          You regard as good people. You have a set of ethical principles that you apply to all people in all circumstances. So in this case, it means Time Warner has made an innocent error by leaving you with the de Luxe cable package, even though you're paying for what I believe they, regardless of the cheapskate package, I think that's how it's designated on my bill. You have to let them know now that the second question becomes, well, how hard do you have to try to let them know and you certainly don't have to make it your life's work to inform someone when they've made this kind of error. So one phone call. Yes, absolutely. Two phone calls. Yeah, I'd say so. That meets my standard. After that, I would send them a letter as much to protect yourself. Should you get receive a bill two years from now for 24 months of the Lux cable service.

Speaker 1:          01:47          But once you've made a good faith, reasonable efforts, and I realized these are ambiguous terms to inform them about their air, then they're on their own. You do not have to make it your life's work to correct time warner sloppiness. The other aspect of this is these exchanges, these moral exchanges have to be symmetrical. That if you would want someone to tell you that they have overcharged you, then you have to tell them that they've undercharged you. Ethics must have parody. Ethics must have symmetry for an ethical proposition to be compelling. It must seem fair no matter which seat you're in.
