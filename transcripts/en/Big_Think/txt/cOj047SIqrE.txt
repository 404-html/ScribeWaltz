Speaker 1:          00:09          I grew up in suburbia, Salt Lake City, Utah for the most part just right outside of salt lake. Um, I'm the oldest of six, kind of a very typical mormon upbringing, very wholesome, going to lab church. And, uh, I joined the army when I was 17. They have a program that allows you to join like the reserves or the national guard or the reserves while you're still in high school. Go to boot camp, uh, come back, finish your senior year and then go back and training and finish all your advanced training. Uh, so that's what I did right after I turned 17 in January and I hadn't listed by February. I enlisted the day after the ground war, uh, for the first Gulf war started. And uh, what I've always told people why I joined, which is the, the most honest answer I can give you, the why I joined is that I was 17 and that's it. It was the first adult decision that I got to make. I, I grew up playing gi joe and stuff like that. So it's like a fun thing. Like, oh, hey, I can kind of, you know, be a boy scout or a kid for their perpetually. And that appealed to me. So I joined.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Wow. Can I haven't talked about this one in the wild that, that it was okay. I'm from Utah. Nothing happens in Utah and moved to New York City in 2000. The towers come down in September, 2001. Um, of course my initial reaction is one of complete disbelief. We live, you know, they say how sometimes you can look right at something and not believe it. Well, that was the first time I've ever really experienced that where I get a phone call, my buddy says, hey, the towers had been hit. I'm like, shut up asshole. Don't come in for new. Never again. And don't tell me ridiculous crap like that. Come on. Then I realized it's not kidding. Um, you know, watching the news walk out to west Broadway. By the time I walked out to west Broadway, the first tower had already fell and I'm looking right at where it was and I'm not seeing it.

Speaker 1:          01:56          And it's like, where's the tower? I don't get it, what happened? I just, I'm looking on that sky and I couldn't and I didn't, I could not process that. The time I was in there, I walk away to try and watch some news and like, ah, maybe I should just watch it. I go back a second time. Now the second tower tower is fallen. So I mean it's probably instead of business lean of times, uh, the feeling of complete disbelief. We were, I, I figured pretty much any national guardsman in New York City at that time knew they were going to get called up. So we just all without being told, started like congregating at our respective armories and we were at ground zero or near Ground Zero that night. The first two days we guarded, uh, an area a few blocks away, you know, from the sites.

Speaker 1:          02:37          And then by the third day, the third week of the 11th day, so I guess it was like a 20 seconds. Uh, we just did what we do as soldiers, which is guard stuff. We'd work 12 hour shifts. Uh, my platoon in particular, it was stationed between buildings four and five and all we did was guard. We set up a perimeter, um, around a big, and our job was to simply screen who came in to the whole, the fire. The fire chief was in charge of the site and he would tell us, okay, here I'm going to own the ironworkers in or only let in ems world was the dogs. And that's what we did. And just kind of said their garden stuff and told people who didn't have the correct authorization from the fire chief to fuck off. Which was actually kind of interesting because anyone who has a suit or badge or anything was down there to include FBI, CIA, Nsa, guys like, you know, every, everyone showed up there was firefighters came from a Minnesota wanting to help and we had to turn away, which was kind of heartbreaking. Um, and that was her job is to kind of guard a big hole.

Speaker 1:          03:48          There was some kind of unscrupulous stuff that I think a lot of people don't love talking about. And uh, looting was a bit of that. Uh, it's, it's, it's, it's hard to thing about it because it's not, when we think about a ground zero and nine 11, and all the incredibly heroic things that took place that day and the amount of the outpouring of, basically it was love that came from the people who were in the army. We have just kids in the lower east side go running around with like doughnut carts, giving us donuts just because they want to. And it was all these wonderful stories. But then there's also the storage to have I like, but there was a soldier in my, you know, one of the, one of our soldiers had found like a box of money and he didn't think that didn't even cross his mind that it was wrong to dilute it.

Speaker 1:          04:31          He ended up getting kicked out of the army or just being an idiot. There were some, I know there were some problems too with people who are in positions of trust, who were taking advantage of the fact that a lot of, like the stores, especially in the basements, uh, of the World Trade Center are now broken and unguarded. Um, and I think that's really kind of a sore spot for a lot of people. I don't know how I details some, I'm being kind of careful about what I say about it, but there were some problems with that and I, it was handled. And hopefully that's kind of the end of it.
