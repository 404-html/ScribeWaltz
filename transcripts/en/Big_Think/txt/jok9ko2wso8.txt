Speaker 1:          00:00          My name is Eric Hippeau, I'm a venture capitalists. My firm is called Larry Hippeau ventures where it's me plus three other partners. We are technology investors. So we look for companies that use technology, primarily consumer technology. It doesn't mean that they have to be consumer facing, but the technology has to be based on the same technology that we all use day to day. Uh, and so we're looking for companies that use technology to either create large new marketplaces or large new businesses, uh, or who disrupt a large businesses that are already in place. Um, and New York is particularly well suited for this because there's a lot of people with very diverse backgrounds, diverse domain knowledge. Uh, we have a lot of people in the, in our educational system, a million kids in our public school system, $600,000 car students, um, and technology today is primarily developed in large urban centers.

Speaker 1:          01:05          So obviously New York is well positioned for that. The, the difference between New York and Silicon Valley is in the kind of technology that people that we develop here as opposed to in Silicon Valley first. I think we should point out where the similarities are and the similarities are that because technology today is transportable and rentable and relatively cheap, uh, to, uh, to use, uh, we in New York, but it could be anywhere, it could be Bombay, could be Austin, have access to the same technology to develop new applications, new services than anybody in Silicon Valley. So everyone starts with the same level playing field. The technology is accessible through the cloud. It's rentable through the cloud. Anybody can start a company with a couple of, of, of, of laptops and a two or three people and you have an, a few thousand dollars literally, and you can start a company and you can start a business.

Speaker 1:          02:04          So it's very different today than it was just a few years ago where a large part of the money that you raised actually went to the acquisition of the technology. You had to buy servers and you have to buy hardware, you had to buy expensive software licenses. And today you don't have to do any of that. So that's a big difference. But, um, we, we have in New York as, as, as, as anywhere else access to the same latest developments in technology than anybody in Silicon Valley. The big differences that New York focuses more on the software layer, on the application and the services layer. Um, so that we're really good at software, New York. We, we, uh, we're good at, um, at platforms. We're good at consumer facing application. We're good at, um, enterprise software, software as a service. We're good at a variety of different domains, obviously are the ones that you can think of the traditional sectors such as advertising and media and uh, but also healthcare and a variety of different domains where you have people who have experience and expertise, uh, because they know some big companies are located here and big sectors of the economy or are based here.

Speaker 1:          03:25          What New York, um, it's probably not going to do is develop the next plumbing for the Internet. That's more likely to be a coming out of the west coast. But having said that, we're increasingly getting more and more advanced engineering talent are in New York. In fact, uh, on Roosevelt Island, uh, there's going to be a cornell university in, in conjunction with the big technology institute in Israel are building a campus and which will be ready in two or three years, but the classes have already started in other locations and this is all going to be advanced applied engineering. So who knows what's going to develop in the future. Some hardware is already being developed in New York. We invest investors, for instance, in Makerbot, the three d printer company that was sold recently to, um, um, another three d printer company. So, uh, so there is a, there is a background in, in hardware and manufacturing in New York, but generally speaking, it's really software that's, um, that's the, the big thing as it were healing.
