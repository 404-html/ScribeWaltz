Speaker 1:          00:00          No,

Speaker 1:          00:07          no, I don't agree. I people have been attacking Alan Greenspan pretty vigorously in the press lately, and a lane. The whole blame for the credit crisis at his feet. So what I think about that is it is two things. One is that in the 19 nineties, Alan Greenspan could do no wrong. He was hailed as the maestro. Bob Woodward wrote a book called the Maestro. Um, and uh, Bob Woodward said, you know, at the end of the wizard of Oz, when the man comes out behind the from behind the curtain, when the wizard chose his face, we feel a little bit underwhelmed. But with Alan Greenspan, we always feel safe or something like that. I think they gave him too much credit for monetary policies when times were good because when times are good things, when the economy is strong, a monetary policy is really sort of boring. But what Alan Greenspan did and realized was he just got out of the way and let productivity drive the economy.

Speaker 1:          01:20          And, but where the real test of a central banker it comes is when the usual rule books don't apply when you're not just making monetary policy for, for ordinary times, but where when you're subject to some fundamental strains on the financial system. And Greenspan faced several such incidents. The first was October of 1987 when the stock market collapsed. Another was the Asian financial crisis in the 19 nineties, the Russian bond default in the 19 nineties, there was the collapse of longterm capital management and the 19 nineties there was 9:11. And in all of those cases, Alan Greenspan understood what the, what the role of the central bank was, was to provide enough liquidity and keep the financial system functioning. And because he knew enough because he did that in those instances, he came out of those crises with his reputation is enhanced. And uh, and that was his real genius, was to know what to do when the system was, was in a severe crisis. And for all those reasons, the shocks that were felt than didn't become the new normal. So the charge against him is in lately has been that he kept interest rates too low for too long, but when he left office there wasn't a lot of inflation. So there's a real question about what do you mean by interest rates being too low for too long? It was not the case that he caused the housing bubble.

Speaker 1:          03:16          Having interest rates low doesn't mean you have to make unwise loans. Nor nor did he encouraged people to assume that prices could only go up and up. So I think he's a convenient scapegoat.
