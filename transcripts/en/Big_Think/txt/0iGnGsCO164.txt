Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, in the history of our industry, there have been some real major events that have transformed the industry and had a huge impact in our lives. The invention of the integrated circuit really opened up a huge number of opportunities to do things that were unimaginable back then than the creation of the personal computer. The PC. That was a huge impact on our lives, not only in our own personal lives, but in the way industry conducted itself and how they use computers to do the things that were important to them. Then the third thing was the introduction. Of course, if they internet, I mean that Internet with pcs and the integrated circuit. You can see how old that is building and and changing the world. I believe that the next step is going to be what's called cognitive computing because technology has changed so much that we have not so much power in our computing capability and so much memory that we can store that we're able for the first time to actually create products that begin to mimic how the brain works and what that means is that the product can actually on a very narrow, particularly expertise, could be as narrow as let's say weather forecasting for example, or something very narrow that the product begins to learn.

Speaker 1:          01:13          I see these youths in and in a way that means he has some cognitive capability, so the more you use it, the better it becomes at a particular function to the point. It actually gets to a point where he begins to actually ask questions of. You. Think of it as a child. You know when a child is born a, their brain is empty, begins to get filled with stuff. Hopefully mostly good, but when it comes to a point in time when the child touches a hot plate and the mother says hot, then the child knows from then on, every time somebody says hot, he better be careful because now his program in his brain and he's learning continues to learn. But there comes that time in the child's life that all of us that have been parents either dread or look forward to is when the child starts asking why, you know, when you do something and say why, why, why, and where the child is doing is learning.

Speaker 1:          02:09          He now has enough cognitive capability to understand enough of what's going on but not enough so that he laughs. Why? Well, in the same way these circuits get to a point where actually they begin to query back and say, I need more information. Give me more information. Tell me about this. And uh, there are some experiments going today on healthcare, in oil exploration, in financial transactions where they actually begin to tap the power of cognitive computing. And I believe that when that happens, we're going to enter an era of that's unimaginable today. And in some ways is kind of exciting to think of the fact that we could, surrounded by intelligence that helps us make our lives better, but it's also somewhat frightening. And the fact that you're now surrounded by intelligence that begins to think they know more than you do. And, and, uh, but we're moving to that direction.

Speaker 1:          03:00          I see it happening. I think we're about 10 years away from that being a real commercial reality. However, the work I've seen done in healthcare in oil exploration and financial transactions tells me that this thing is very real. And I'll give you one small example of how powerful it can be. A cannot disclose the names of the companies, but in one particular example is they've looked at the data on a particular medicine that was used to, you know, to treat patients. And the way things had been done up to now is you get a medicine, you get FDA approval, and then you put it out and then you collect data and about 10 years later you say, you know, I'd, we're going to take the medicine off the market because it's causing some major problem. Um, well they took an example like that and say, let's pretend that we had this cognitive capability back then and fitted the data that we had and see what happens.

Speaker 1:          03:56          Well, this actually cognitive machine was able to predict within a matter of weeks of the product being on the market, what took 10 years of collecting data so you can see how powerful something like that could be. And what he does is because the computing capabilities so fast and the amount of memory so large in a very narrow segment, it can do what let's say 10,000 people would do if you could get them all together in one room to look at one problem. And so it is, I see this to me, uh, as a next revolution in technology and will impact everything that we do.
