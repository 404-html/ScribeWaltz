Speaker 1:          00:04          I would advise anyone including myself that any moment you are, you understand your life is good. Then everything that's led up to it was worthwhile. And the reason I say that, it's not that I haven't laid mistake, I'd made some glorious mistakes and I suffered in my life for those mistakes. But I'm sitting here talking to you this morning and my world. I am too concerned with the, the, the problems. Uh, then in trailer parks everywhere. But in my personal world, I couldn't be happier. I have six kids. They delight me thoroughly and they are all very close with one another and our family get togethers at the best thing going in my life. So I figure if I can say that at this moment, feel that at this moment it wouldn't change anything that got me here. You know, all of the mistakes, all the drama, all of the bullshit that went on earlier that so much of which I was responsible for.

Speaker 1:          01:19          If the, if the moment you're at is a great moment and you're happy for who you are at this moment, that everything that got you here is worthwhile because it's all gone. That's yesterday. The two, two of the most important words I think, uh, are over in next. When somebody is over, it is over. And then we're all onto the next and the hammock in the middle between those two words is what I think is meant by truly living in the moment. You know, when I get it from this interview, it's greatest was there ain't anything I can do if I wish to fix or change or I've done it next. So I think being invested in next and not the past, it's best.
