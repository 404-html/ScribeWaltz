Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:07          When I graduated from Trinity College in Law, I was fortunate enough to go to the Harvard law school at a particularly interesting time. I'm the class of 68 so I was there in 1967 and 68 and that was a time when young Americans are questioning the war in Vietnam. They were interested in civil rights programs in the south than Martin Luther King was assassinated. That here and Robert Kennedy just after I graduated and I came back to Ireland, imbued with that sense that young people can make a difference. And I was elected to the Irish Senate very shortly afterwards and the first measure bill in the parliament that I introduced to the age of 25 was a bill to legalize family planning. It seemed to me to be very simple because married women were not allowed to have the contraceptive pill unless they had cycle regulation problems and it must have been the weather.

Speaker 2:          01:01          But there was a phenomenon of many married women having cycle regulation problems and also you couldn't buy or sell the pill. It was a criminal offense. But if you could manage to get a pill, oh, sorry, the condom, and you could use a condom, but not by herself. And I felt this is something that just needs to be straightened out. And I completely underestimated the grave offense and a concern that I caused to a whole range of people. I was denounced by bishops and priests from the pulpit, and I was denounced by newspapers. I was an outcast for awhile, and it was a very troubling experience. I kind of wobbled because I'd been used to being more or less reasonably admired and liked. I was doing well, and suddenly I was actually a heat figure and got hate mail. It was very good for me because I learned a lesson, but a few really believe that something is important and it's true. Then stick to it. Go through with a, pay the price, be unpopular. Don't be arrogant, but sometimes you have to stick to your principles.
