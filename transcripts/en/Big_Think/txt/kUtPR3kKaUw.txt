Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:11          is, is a lousy, but, uh, you know, I'm old enough to have lived through a few business cycles so I'm not particularly perturbed about it by it. And um, you know, I would say that I'm a change creates opportunity. So from an entrepreneur's perspective, this isn't a good time or bad time, it's just the time. It's the time like any other time and any other time, uh, there's always opportunities. Now the opportunity has to fit with the, the, the, uh, the current economic context. Uh, but I don't think the fact that the, uh, economies, uh, uh, at a slow period and, and, and maybe so for awhile, there shouldn't be anything. The turtle

Speaker 2:          00:51          for sure.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Well, uh, you know, I think just so many stupid things that are currently going on, there's a few things that would be really helpful for small business. I'm a huge and unmanageable costs for small businesses, healthcare and the cost to the individual entrepreneur. If you leave a corporate job and start your own business, even just to do, to take care of yourself and your family is a huge, huge expense, that's a problem. That's not just for small businesses is a national problem that we have a, that the issue of healthcare that really needs to be addressed and there's got to be affordable healthcare for a to allow people who work in small business to have the coverage that they need. And I would extend that to thinking about all sorts of other employee benefits and pensions and so on, a great obstacle for small businesses to be able to attract people out of corporate jobs if they have to give up some of those, some of those perks of pensions and so on.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Um, uh, so healthcare is one big issue at this. The second big issue. And uh, we're now dealing with a gasoline that at unheard of prices, uh, and um, uh, which is adding a real burden for lots of folks just getting back and forth to work. But it's changing the nature of our economy. Uh, this is potentially a good thing if a, this can be signaled in some, through some policy way to suggest that we are going to for once take seriously the idea of reducing our dependence on oil and the venture community is just chomping at the bit a to be able to address some of these issues of renewable energy. Uh, the problem is that as oil prices have gone up and down, a previous investments didn't pan out because the oil price goes up and the price comes down and all of a sudden the cost of these old alternative technologies, uh, is too expensive. So, uh, I think, uh, uh, something that could really be a great boost to the economy is, is a serious, I'm serious policy, a initiative to address the healthcare costs and a serious policy issue, uh, to, uh, allow entrepreneurs to address the issue of renewable energies. And that will just bring so much a new talent and ideas into the marketplace.
