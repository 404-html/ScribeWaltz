Speaker 1:          00:02          When do you start talking about hope? Some people think it's immediately a kind of Pollyanna ish thing, like, oh, it should be hopeful, or it's kind of a greeting card. Um, sentiment. You go kind of doe wide and start thinking soft thoughts about how we should all be hopeful in one another. And of course there are some important things to be said in favor of those kinds of things, but we think of hope as also an extremely difficult and important and foundational sort of state that can be discussed in ways that aren't. So saccharin. One of the interesting things that philosophers talk about with respect to hope is of course it's rationality. So there's a sense in which you can't hope for everything you can wish for. Lots of things for which you can't hope. I can wish that the bears won the superbowl last year.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Uh, but I can't hope that they won the superbowl last year because we know that they didn't. And so it seems almost like you're misusing the word to say, I hope that they won last year, or I hope that the weather was different yesterday than it was. So there's a kind of semantic content that suggests that there are rationality constraints on hope, which philosophers tried to look at an analyze. There's a kind of orthodox account. People call it the Orthodox account because most people share it, uh, that says that hope involves at least desiring something and believing that it's possible. So in this case, you wouldn't believe that the weather yesterday could be different than it was, and so you wouldn't believe that's possible. And so you can't really hope for it. So that's that condition that's constraining the rationality of hope. And then there's this kind of debate about what further conditions might be required.

Speaker 1:          01:45          One thought experiment that people have discussed frequently is that of the Shawshank redemption. So this is a Stephen King short story that was turned into a film. You have two characters and, and read both of them really desire something to get out of prison. Both of them regarded as possible. It's explicit in the story and in the film, but somehow one character, andy is hopeful and says he's hopeful and that he's acting in such a way as to make it come about. Even if he thinks it's extremely unlikely. And the other character red says he can't allow himself to hope. The fear of disappointment is too great and will crush him. So they both meet those conditions. It's something they really desire and it's something they believe to be possible. And yet one hopes and the other despairs. So cases like this make people think, oh, we need some other kind of condition to really explain the difference between hope and despair.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And that's where some of the debate is at the moment, trying to find this elusive third conditions. And different people have different things they want to add to the Orthodox conception. My own favored approach, which I'm in the middle of writing up a is what I call the focus or attention account of hope. Uh, so it basically says something like the difference between hope and despair is the extent to which you're focusing on the very slim odds of the thing coming about or whether you're focusing on the fact that it's possible or that you take it to be possible. So if you're focused on the thing as a possibility under the aspect of its possibility, if you want, then you're hoping for it. If you're focusing on the fact that it's incredibly unlikely and the odds are so such long shot odds, then you're despairing of it.

Speaker 1:          03:31          So you can desire it in the same way you can believe that it's possible in the same way. And it's this focus that really makes the difference between hope and despair. It might even be a kind of spectrum thing where you can move back and forth. The focus might be under your control sometimes other times given the circumstances or the the strength of the desire that might not always be under your control. So I also kind of talk a little bit about the way a certain kind of, if you want, mindfulness training can lead us to be more hopeful people cultivating the virtue of hope by learning how to focus on something under the aspect of its possibility rather than allowing our focus or attention to always drift towards the fact that it's so unlikely. Um, you can even hear this in the way that someone might say something about what they hope for or despair of.

Speaker 1:          04:20          So in the Andy and red case, Andy might say, I know that it's really unlikely, but at least it's possible and sort of focus on the possibility. That's the hopeful sort of approach. And Red might say, I know that it's possible, but it's really unlikely. Same desire, same estimation of the probabilities, but you can even hear in the way it's stated, I kind of difference in attitude that I take to be the essential difference between hope and despair. So one more locus of discussion is the relationship between hope, optimism and action. I think a lot of people regard hope in a way as unserious because it gets detached from action in a certain way. So hope is something that you do when you can't do anything else. It's the kind of curse that is left in Pandora's box because you still have it, even though there's nothing else you can do with respect to achieving the goal and question.

Speaker 1:          05:19          I'm just hoping for it. It seems possible, but there's not much I can do. I'm just sort of passively hoping. Um, that obviously seems like a bit of a character of the way in which hope might actually work. And so we're curious, and people in both psychology, sociology, or other social sciences as well as philosophers and religious studies people in our project think about the way in which hope underwrites action, hope manifested itself in action. Hope is the result of actions. So agency and hope is a really interesting set of issues that we think is underdeveloped.
