Speaker 1:          00:07          No one is talking honestly about Iraq

Speaker 2:          00:15          and it's very, very hard to say what our responsibilities are given the unholy or maybe it's holy mess that we have created, um, in, uh, in Iraq we need to shout help. We need to ask for help from the Europeans and we need to open negotiations with the Iranians. We need to be talking to the Turks, um, but um, and we need to be planning our own disengagement, but any, any politician, any democratic politician who claims that we're gonna withdraw from Iraq and the near future is just lying to the American people because I'm. The Kurds don't want us to withdraw. The Sunni chiefs don't want us to withdraw. The Shiite government doesn't want us to withdraw the Saudis, the Kuwaitis, the Jordanians, the Egyptians, the Israelis and the Turks don't want us to withdraw. All of those allies of the United States in the Middle East are very much afraid of anything that looks like a defeat for the United States and a withdrawal on the schedule. But it hasn't been proposed by Obama and Clinton, I suppose, although they've given themselves a lot of loopholes. But withdrawal on that schedule would be a defeat, in fact, it would, it might be a route. And um, and so nobody is going to do that. Um, and how to plan a disengagement because we, we have to get out how to plan a disengagement that doesn't, that doesn't leave everyone that we have worked with in the Middle East. I'm crying how to do that is enormously difficult. And none of the candidates are talking honestly about those difficulties.
