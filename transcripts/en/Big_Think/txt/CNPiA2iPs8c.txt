Speaker 1:          00:07          Let's talk about your four pillars for a second. When I was reading that description, to me, what came immediately to mind was a young child that kind of the epitome of mindfulness. You know, someone who has wisdom of a sort who has wonder for sure, who's very giving. Because we now have a lot of research that shows that children are naturally very altruistic. It seems like a child is kind of the, the most mindful person you can have and you even quote the child is father to the man. You quote that poem in your book. So I was wondering if you kind of, if, if you agree with that, if you think that we should be looking more to kind of prolong our childhood in a certain way.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Science, I love the idea of prolonging our childhood. Why making it conscious? Cause if that's the difference, right? Is the fact that it's like returning to the garden of Eden but with consciousness, it's a dsl yet by him about, you know, returning home but seeing it for the first time. One of the things that I, I often use as, um, as a sort of example of how I want to react to life that has to do with genuine is the way children get angry, upset. They cry. That's right. Tamper Tantrum. And then two minutes later it's gone. And it's like a different human being. And I think if we can be like that, it would be just an amazing way to experience life instead of holding on to resentments and Angus and judgments for yes. And that affecting a whole experience of life.

Speaker 1:          01:47          Do you think we need to go to kind of to that extreme in order to be able to appreciate mindfulness and incorporate it, we need to kind of experience the, not necessarily burnout a severe as you did, but all of the negative things first or is it possible to just sail on through?

Speaker 2:          02:06          Oh, I think absolutely. We can incorporate mindfulness from a very early age and now increasingly we see people, I mean young children being taught to meditate in order to have, it's like a tool that they can use at any point in their lives. My two daughters made a date and they encourage each other. They text each other when one is about to meditate, to encourage the other to remember to do, how many days. So they're using it as a tool because even the most blessed at life is going to include problems, challenges, tragedies, often. So if we have a tool that allows us to return to that centered place, we all have every religion mentioned Zaid every philosopher, you know, asking me this call date, give me a place to stand and I can move the world. So that place on which we can stand and deal with whatever life brings us up to me. He's just an incredible adventure to learn to go back to that place and we don't do it again and again until we can have easier access to it.

Speaker 3:          03:25          Yeah.
