Speaker 1:          00:09          With respect to that, I have to say that less than five percent of Alzheimer Diseases are genetic trust meter. So 95 percent are not genetically transmitted. And uh, generally speaking, the ones that are genetically transmitted, the, they tend to occur at earlier ages than adult is not a general rule, but more often people who have it because of genetic reasons that a five percent of the people population, uh, they have it at the earlier ages, but it's only five percent or less than five percent, about five. That number. It's not that in China there is more than America, less than Europe. There is more or less than here and there, but there are a particular population that in a tigger circumstances that could lead to dementia. And, uh, because of, uh, the habits of those, uh, the population, there are small groups of people. For instance, uh, in the, in the Pacific, they were population.

Speaker 1:          01:28          They used to eat the brain of the dead people. And then they were transferring disease, which one of the symptoms of the disease was dementia and they were all developing goodman's over there. There was a higher incidence of dementia just because of this habit of hitting the brain of the people that were that and therefore like an infectious disease, they were transferring the disease for one, two and higher incidents of people affected. This is once this was found in this habits where it stopped, then the incidents of disease became the same as a, with in other populations in general. You know, if you look at our society, there is not a population of people or you know, that is more affected by the loss of memory. It is a problem. And that heats with aging. So something related with the, with aging. And so as we age, we get more memory, more memory problem.

Speaker 1:          02:44          Obviously not all people are equal. There are some one, a better memory than others. And uh, and we do not know why some people have a better memory than others. I mean, we say that, uh, that, um, they, uh, free keep ourselves and our brand exercises just like a muscle, a gen, we tend to have memory problems, less memory problems. So it kind of protective the activity of mental activity. Even some people think even physical activity, it could be protected against the memory loss, the loss of memory. Um, that's what, uh, I have to say I'm obviously, there are diseases which are associated. The one of the most typical one is Alzheimer's disease which are associated with the loss of memory and a hardass but are of less relevance and less and the characteristic symptoms of our symptom of Alzheimer's disease, which is really whole market disease, is the loss of what we call short term memory. So that's how the disease starts. Actually. It's people who can not remember what they just did, the justice, a very short term memory loss and that's last for very, very long time. And progressively the memory problem get worse and worse. Um, and only at the late stage of Alzheimer disease, it's also longterm memory is affected. But the major characteristic of Alzheimer disease, which is a very widespread disease in the population patient at old age is the loss of short term memory.
