Speaker 1:          00:08          Bye

Speaker 2:          00:09          five ingredients that I always have on hand you now as a salt and pepper deal and then, you know, whereas that, you know, these days I have a lot of blue hill farm is really gung ho into this milk deal. So like we have now nine cows that were milking, so I generally always have milk on hand. This is a new thing but unpasteurized beautiful milk and we're experimenting with all this stuff with that. So, you know, I would say three, four and five is about something of milk, like either raw milk or, or, or butter which we're making from the milk or ricotta cheese or Mozzarella cheese. Somebody that's coming out of the dairy and that's coming from the land, you know, and that, that, that is exciting that, you know, we're using this the, you know, where I began. Uh, and we're, we're, we're expanding on it. And uh, and now in the kitchen, I'm making things out of it. That's it. There is nothing more pleasurable to me than, than having that kind of connection. And I hope to share that with, with one Pico.
