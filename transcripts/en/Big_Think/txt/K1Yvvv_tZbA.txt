Speaker 1:          00:03          Eye Witness testimony, uh, of course is the single greatest cause of the conviction of the innocent. And what's fascinating about that is that, uh, we have now, um, 30 years, more than 30 years of fantastic research from experimental psychologists who have, uh, you know, recreated crime scene. We recreated a events and, uh, played around with which different way we do a photo array or a lineup and different techniques that are used correlate more with accurate and reliable identifications in which, uh, techniques lead to errors. And, uh, a number of reforms have been,

Speaker 2:          00:44          uh, uh, adopted, uh, by federal

Speaker 1:          00:50          commissions and the American Bar Association, the International Association of Chiefs of Police, lots of policing entities based on really good scientific research. I mean, a lot of this research, there's Meta analyses a, that's where you pulled together lots of different studies, um, and you have a lot of confidence that certain things, uh, are real effects. And I'll give you some examples. Uh, that may surprise people. Um, for example, before you show somebody a photo array or a live lineup, he should tell the witness. Um, we're now going to show you some pictures or people, uh, uh, please keep in mind that the real perpetrator may or may not be in this photo array or a lineup. And if you don't make an identification, don't worry, the investigation will continue. Just giving that morning, uh, dramatically reduces incorrect identifications without really reducing correct identifications. And that's of extraordinary importance obviously in terms of being able to go out, find the real perpetrator and not arrest the wrong person. Uh, uh, there's lots of reasons we think that this warning will reduce era. Uh, certainly it inhibits people from guessing and, uh, uh, there's kind of a natural inclination to do that. Um, another reform that's of really critical importance is that the person that administers the lineup of the photo array should be double blinded. That is to say that the person should not know who, uh, the suspect is. Um, uh, and that's important for many reasons, not the least of which is the possibility

Speaker 2:          02:34          of, uh, feedback, um,

Speaker 1:          02:40          confirming feedback. What again, Meta analyses have shown is that if you say to somebody off you picked that number too good or it gives some kind of confirming feedback, whether a law enforcement person or somebody else. Frankly, what this does is it can falsely inflate at the person's certainty that they made the correct identification, the witnesses belief that they had a good opportunity to observe the witnesses belief that they were paying attention when the crime was committed. Um, all of these factors, by the way, certainty, opportunity to observe paying attention are all factors that the courts used to be using or use frankly, and trying to weigh the reliability of identification when we know that let's say some suggestive procedure has been used. So positive, uh, confirming feedback or even just the use of an unduly suggestive procedure can falsely inflate these so called reliability factors, uh, uh, certainty, opportunity to observe, attention paid.

Speaker 1:          03:49          And, uh, the legal tests are out of whack with what the scientific evidence shows more than a year ago. Now, the National Academy of Sciences came out with a report about forensic science, generally extremely important report, a landmark report that anybody really interested in this field should look at. Um, and this report, uh, basically said, look, DNA testing is the only validated a forensic discipline we have. Um, and in particular, when you look at pattern evidence, and by this they were talking about fingerprints and tire tracks and looking at the striations on bullets and trying to determine just it gives me whether they came from a gun, particular gun or not. Um, all these, uh, pattern disciplines had not been adequately validated, uh, because she would have, uh, an, uh, an experts coming into court and they'd say, I'm looking at the striations of this bullet that we recovered from the crime scene.

Speaker 1:          04:50          And now I found this defendant's gun. And I fired a bullet from that. And I'm looking at the two of them under a microscope, and I see all these lines and I think there's quote unquote sufficient agreement. And by that. And if I'm really a big quality assurance lab, I'll bring my buddy and, and he'll look at the microscope and he'll say, I think there's also agreement here. And from this I can now tell you that this bullet came from that gun to the exclusion of all other guns in the universe. Well, think about it scientifically. On what basis do you have a database? Can you tell us anything about the frequency of firing similar patterns if indeed you have similar patterns? Do you have measurement area here? Can you give us a number? You know, with DNA testing we can give you a number, we can give you the frequency of a particular DNA profile and the various different populations.

Speaker 1:          05:37          Can you give us a statistic? Um, and the answer is no. They weren't giving statistics. As a matter of fact, they were just saying it's unique. This bullet comes from that gun to the exclusion of all guns in the universe. This is nonsense. And the National Academy of Science said so and so, you guys are really got to go back to the drawing board and do some basic research. Uh, to find out what the answers are to that question. Even fingerprints, um, which we know I, if you take all 10, uh, prints and you scan it in and you put it into a data, the database of known, uh, fingerprints, you can do a pretty good job of identifying somebody. But that's not the question. When you're talking about a small latent print that a crime scene, you get a partial thumbprint, let's say, and every time you lay down a print, it's always a little bit uneven and then you compare it to somebody else's thumb print. Can you say that this small latent uniquely comes from that individual? Well, uh, that is the way the testimony was going in for years. And it was a, uh, uh, that scientific basis to say that it uniquely was this person's print. You can't say that.
