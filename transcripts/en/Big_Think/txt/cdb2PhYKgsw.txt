Speaker 1:          00:09          Was Obama's postpartum and agenda is that he came into it, he came into his presidency, uh, at a time when millions of Americans, perhaps even tens of millions of Americans, don't consider a Democrat president legitimate, don't get sued of liberalism, legitimate dunk. Consider the idea of the state for my new programs to help people legitimate. Uh, so he's in a situation, a lot like a, you know, Abraham Lincoln face in 1860, when you had millions of Americans who didn't even consider what was going on in Washington to have anything to do with them. So, uh, the big question for me was always was this post partisan idea, this idea that you could kind of bring adversaries across the table and get them to agree to each other and agree with to get them to agree with each other and uh, achieve social progress. Was that a deep seated belief of his or was that in a certain sense, a tactic?

Speaker 1:          01:06          Not as cynical tactic, but a tactic? And, uh, I would be very with him if it were a way of thinking about politics, if it were a tactic. Because the job of a transformative leader is not too huge the center, but to define their own values as the center as commonsense. And, uh, if he, you know, I, I believe in the agenda he's passed, he's, he's putting far, for example, universal healthcare, you know, for example, uh, you know, cap and trade and green jobs as a way to solve our energy problems while growing the economy. I think these are reasonable, uh, while liberal goals and, uh, if he presents them as reasonable and the reaction to them as one could knew they were going to be, because there are these millions of people who don't consider a liberal president. Legitimate was irrational extreme that presented him an opportunity to say, my program is rational, but my opposition has chosen extremism, has chosen unreasoned and be willing to take the hit that there's always going to be a minority of the country.

Speaker 1:          02:24          30%, 35%, even 40% who disagrees with him radically disagrees with him strongly. But if he's still willing to pass his program with debt, 60% margin, the rest of the country will eventually catch up. The reaction. Notice we'll understand as they did with social security as they did with, you know, women getting the vote, freeing the slaves, you know, a social security that actually these things were in their interests. They'll accept them as part of the established order of American society. And in fact, 20, 30, 40, down years, years down the road, the Republicans and the Conservatives will be campaigning to see if universal health care, just like they can't paint to save social security. But the problem is this doesn't really work unless you make this kind of tactical shift. If people say that you're illegitimate and, uh, your liberal agenda is extremist socialist, uh, destroying the America that we all grew up with. You have to be willing to say this is unreasonable. This is extreme. And if you aren't able to say this is unreasonable and this is extreme, then you're granting your opposition, uh, an undue influence. You're basically, uh, negotiating with the under negotiate bubble. And, uh, as Abraham Lincoln said quite eloquently in his 1860 speech at Cooper Union, uh, you can't win that way.

Speaker 1:          04:00          I've been saying for years that, uh, you know, there are millions of Americans who basically don't consider, uh, the liberal project legitimate. They consider it the opposite of what America means to them and, uh, that they derive their identity from questioning the legitimacy and the ability of the liberal government to, to function peacefully. So, uh, I think that for a couple months, uh, even more maybe six months, uh, Barack Obama's charisma and his, uh, his remarkable popularity, uh, kind of stunned some of these people into silence. I think people couldn't quite believe what they're saying. But if you, if you, if you, if you look at it historically, it's, you know, quite continuous with what happened when Bill Clinton became president. You know, when you began to hear people, you know, a accusing him of, uh, you know, murdering his aids. You know, when you began to have, uh, people, uh, saying that he was actually, uh, you know, ancient for a, the Soviet Union, which he had visited when he was a child, or when he was a teenager, when he was in college.

Speaker 1:          05:07          And you saw the same thing when Jimmy Carter became president. And, uh, you know, um, he was immediately considered a part of this, uh, corrupt Democratic Party establishment. Uh, it happened every time a Democrat was elected in, it will happen. Every time a Democrat is elected. It's, it's, it's part of our patrimony as Americans. And the challenge for a Barack Obama or any democrat or any liberal is to understand that this is just part of who we are as Americans. To acknowledge it, to respect it, and to transcend it. And, uh, you know, uh, the lion can lay down with the lamb, but it's not going to last for very long.
