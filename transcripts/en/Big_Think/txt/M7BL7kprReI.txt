Speaker 1:          00:08          That is used in many ways and in a spiritual life fascination that we have for food and for taste is can be a very wonderful and exciting adventure in life. But it can also be a distraction from the important work of life. All the tastes and sights and sounds of the world are the same. They're wonderful, they're amazing. They should be celebrated. But at the same time, uh, we can use things like restraint and diet as a way to give us more time and energy to concentrate on more impossibly, uh, uh, things that we wouldn't neglect, uh, in our lives through the easy distractions, the sights and sounds of the world of which food is, is one of those. So the word in Sanskrit is taught or a steroidy. So you, you try to simplify your diet to reduce it to the lowest common denominators so that it would be nutritious.

Speaker 1:          01:12          That's one aspect of diet. Another aspect of diet that is the most important aspect of diet for the Yogi is that you trying to remove all the violence from your diet so that, uh, no one suffered so that your plate could be full and that you are grateful that, um, that you obtain this food with the least amount of suffering. Each one of us causes suffering just by being on this earth. Um, when we just innocently step our foot down on the sidewalk, we're stepping on many microorganisms that weren't hurting us at all. Just trying to establish little communities. Uh, they're in the, in the sidewalk and, uh, so a Yogi tries to be conscious of every step in that way so that we wouldn't cause unnecessary harm. The same is true for diet. Um, many of the things that get to our plate gets get there only through a lot of suffering and deprivation. And, uh, so a Yogi tries to remove that and, uh, obviously, uh, that if you take the sentient beings out of your diet, that is if you eat a vegan diet where no animal products are included, you're taking a large chunk of that suffering that you've caused out of your life. And that removal of a selfish path in life, that, uh, awareness of how your choices impact others changes you and it also the world around you. It's quite, yeah.
