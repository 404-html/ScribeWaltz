Speaker 1:          00:09          That would be a little hard to say. But when I was eight years old, my grandfather died and I knew that he had written poetry because I used to see him writing poetry in his box and I was very close to him. And uh, after he died, I went down to the basement of my family house where my family kept books, anthologies and things. And there was an anthology without any names attached to an, I read a poem called spellbound. And I somehow attached it to my grandfather's death. And I, I thought my grandfather had written it. In fact, I was sure he had written it. And it was a great constellation to me and something planted in my mind that you could write poetry, that you could read poetry. The portrait could somehow console you. I didn't sit down then and start writing poems, but it was in the back of my mind.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Now when I was in high school, I was leafing through an anthology that our teachers had given us. And I found it a poem. I go, that's so strange. This, this poem looks so much like my grandfather's poem that I looked for another one GRANDPA's poem. It turns out it had been written by Emily Bronte and it wasn't my grandfather's poem at wall, although my response to it I think was pretty much the same. I just had the author wrong. Um, but that was the beginning though. I didn't start writing until I was in high school and when I was in high school, I really began to, I really began to write poetry with great energy and enthusiasm.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I was in high school. I used to show them to my sister and I thought everything I wrote was so great. And my poor sister, who's a year younger than I am, couldn't understand them at a wall, but she was enthusiastic about my writing them. When I was a freshman in college, I went to Grinnell College in Iowa. I brought my poems to my freshman humanities teacher whose name was Carol Parson, a wonderful teacher. And Carol did a really great thing for me. She's, she taught me more than anyone. She somehow read my poems and came back to me and convinced me that I could be a poet, that I had the passion and the enthusiasm and the creativity to become a poet. But that what I was writing was not poetry because I was just expressing my feelings and I wasn't trying to make anything. The oldest word for, for poetry and Greek is pollicis, which means making a poet as a maker and a poem as a made thing.

Speaker 1:          02:36          And Carol Somehow convinced me that I could become a poet, but that I was not writing poetry. And then I would have to try and make something, um, to write poetry and that I started then to try and shape something rather than just express it. And when I started to shape something and to imitate other poems that were written by other people, when I tried to integrate reading and my writing, I was on my payoff. I guess that would have been 1968 I was a freshman in college and I, I wasn't writing good poems, but I was at least trying to write poems. Then there has been no poet, no great poet in the history of poetry who hasn't also been a great reader of poetry. This is sometimes distressing to my students when I tell them this. Now I do say it's possible. You might be the first, I'm not saying it's impossible, but the odds are very much against you.

Speaker 1:          03:31          All great poets have been great readers. And the way to learn your craft in poetry is by reading other poetry and by letting it guide you a great model for this is the way that Dante calls on Virgil at the beginning of the inferior. No, um, the divine comedy to help guide them through the underworld and in a way that's also a recognition that Dante needs virgil and that the infare inferno needs the Aeneid and that the epic needs a model and that for Dante to write this great poem, he needs someone to come before him and he turns to Virgil's taxed, especially books six where in the US goes down into the underworld. And for me that's a model of the poets relationship to a pre to previous poetry, to another poetry as a, as calling out for guidance.

Speaker 1:          04:36          There are many poets that I use as my models. Um, in my first book of poems, um, I had several for the sleepwalkers, I had several poems that were apprentice poems like this in which I take a walk with a, with a, with a poet who's no longer alive. One of them as I walk with Federico Garcia Lorca around the upper west side in Manhattan because that was a neighborhood he lived in. And I imagine walking around Paris with Cesar via whole Great Peruvian poet who lived in Paris. And, uh, I kind of, I create the walk as a kind of drama of my apprenticeship. Now, it is true that I think one of the things that distinguished my work from the beginning when I was in college was my turning towards poetry from other countries that I didn't ever consider poetry. The province exclusively of English and American literature. And I discovered a great amount in reading, Polish poetry and other eastern European poetry and reading Russian poetry and reading Latin American and Spanish poetry. And I've always found models in those other poetry's of poets who could help me on my payoff.

Speaker 1:          05:49          I think it shapes it in very deep ways that you don't entirely understand. Um, Rainer Maria Rocha said there are two sources for poetry. One is dreams and the other is childhood. And I think childhood is an inexhaustible source of your becoming who you will be and certain deep feelings are set inside of you a certain construct of emotions that really define who you are and who you will become. And I feel very much that my childhood is very alive inside of me, very close to me, very much part of me. And I'm at an a sometimes painful, sometimes joyous in exhaustible resource for poetry and a lot of portraits. Putting yourself back into the state of wonder that you have before things when you're a child, it's not only a joyous wonder, it's sometimes a grief stricken wonder. Um, I have, uh, the idea that lyric poetry is a poetry that's driven by a sense of the presence of death.

Speaker 1:          06:53          That there's something unbearable about the fact that we're going to die and that we can't stand it. And I think you find that out in childhood and you don't really, at least I found that out in childhood and I found that hard to get over. And now I'm 60 years old and I still find it hard to get over. And I think it's one of the things that drive lyric poetry, our sense of mortality, our sense that things are transient, that everything is passing. And then if you want to save something from the endless flux of experience, um, and the world's movement, you have to set down a steak and try and make something that will last.
