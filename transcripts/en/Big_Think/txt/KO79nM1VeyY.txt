Speaker 1:          00:13          But we are engaging now in several research projects. We started out with a study in Parkinson's disease, so we're working with a bay area Parkinson's, a treatment center, and they also have researchers there. Um, but the way that works is that if you're a part of 23 and me, you can fill out the online surveys that we have and you can fill out any ones you're interested in. And they're not just all really serious research. There are some fun surveys to fill out about are you left or right handed idea, blue eyes, Brown eyes. Um, and some of these features that we hope to also discover the genetics for which there's so much to be learned. Um, so we're in the process of running more and more of those research experiments.
