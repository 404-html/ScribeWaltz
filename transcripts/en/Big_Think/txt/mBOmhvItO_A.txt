Speaker 1:          00:03          Joanne, writing poetry as being down on your hands and knees with the language. Um, you know, if someone carbs a swans and animals out of soap and that person loves soap. And if you right, you love the language. So it's an opportunity. Writing a poem is an opportunity to get as close to the language has pretty much you can get. Um, the other joy because it is a pleasure and I, I wouldn't, I have no high mission that drives me to write poetry. It is a very hedonistic activity and I get, I write it for pleasure, I go there to get pleasure and uh, and if possible to give pleasure. Um, so, uh, one of the key pleasures is, and most poets would, would, would agree with this, it starting out not knowing where you're going and finding a way to get there. So the poem becomes not a whole expression of something you think or feel, but it becomes a journey through itself to an ending.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And that ending is a unforeseeable. And in fact, the ending is something that the poem is busy creating. It's almost as if the poem is the only way to access that. That particular ending. Uh, I have a poem called questions about angels. And at the end of that poem, uh, an angel appears and I didn't know she existed before I write that wrote that poem. And I guess strictly speaking she didn't. So I think of that poem is simply the job of that poem is to bring her into being, to bring its own ending into being. When you're not writing, there's an anxiety about whether you will right again, um, of all the kinds of writers, well, at least compared to playwrights and novelists, poets return to the blank page more frequently. Um, and you know, a novel can take you six months or five years to write, but a poem, you know, can get done in an afternoon or a couple of days, um, and then you're back to zero and you have to restart from nothing.

Speaker 1:          02:17          And at that point, the question comes up. I mean, can you restart? Can you boot yourself up again, so to speak? Or was that ed? Um, so that, that is probably the main anxiety I think that goes with poetry writing is, um, heavier exposure to the blank page or regular, uh, encounters with blankness. I just go poem by poem. I don't have an overarching, you know, sense of a book as a project. I probably have a manuscript. I do have a manuscript of foams that is just about ready and I'm just, you don't want to send it out too early. It probably needs maybe two or three at the most, um, really strong, good poems and that it will be ready. And so I'm just interested in getting that out of the house and maybe starting upon this afternoon or our next Wednesday, you know?

Speaker 2:          03:16          Oh, great.
