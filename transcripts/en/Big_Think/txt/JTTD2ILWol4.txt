Speaker 1:          00:07          I hope, uh, and I, and I don't mean this

Speaker 2:          00:12          lightly, but I hope that when I think about my contribution legacy, that the first thing is that my kids will say, you know, was pretty good guy. Um, and, and, and will quote me, you know, in, in, in, in your dad, always used to say, or I remember some time when dad said, uh, that would be one piece. I remember going to Rome the first time and making a point of seeing keats's grave and weeping. It keeps his grave. And I did because, you know, there it is. I mean, he craved and mortality and on his tombstone is written here lies one whose name was written water. And you never know whether Kate's was, you know, I actually thought that or whether he was doing that, figuring that if by doing that, you know, sort of like taking an umbrella so it wouldn't rain. Um, uh, whether he, that was a protection or whether he was, whether, whether it was just false modesty.

Speaker 2:          01:10          But, but I'd like to think that in some of the work that I've done both in my own writing and as the editor of Hbr, that there will be a few things that have changed some organizations for the better, you know, when I was at, fortunately before coming to Hbr, I wrote two books about intellectual capital and about the value of knowledge and the importance of thinking of knowledge in organizations and developing knowledge assets and developing, using, tapping into people's brains and creativity worth. And those have had an influence I think along with a lot of other things. I may have contributed to that. But I also, I hope that in that work and, and in the work I've done at Hbr, they'll be some people who say, you know, that article or that idea that, that, that, that changed things that, that, that gave people some stuff that made some lives better. Or, or even ideally some organizations, you know, I'm a change changed the practice of management in some permanent way so that we stop screwing things up quite as often as we did.
