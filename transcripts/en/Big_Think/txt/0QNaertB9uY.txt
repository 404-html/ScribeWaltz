Speaker 1:          00:03          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          I write every day. I get up around five or so and get two little kids off to school and then I go to work around nine and work until four o'clock or so and then do it pretty much every day. Oh, I wish. No, it doesn't get easier. It gets harder in fact, because I, you can't write the same book and that would, that's always tempting to making a sentences is hard work. You can't copy your own sentences and you can't copy those of others. And so you're searching, you're searching for a certain grace in a certain rhythm and melody that's underneath the pros that carries the story.

Speaker 2:          00:59          Great question. The first answer that pops in my head is absolutism certainty. I'm certain about very little in this world and I just trust those who are, they have a, I feel a stinker. The smell of, of a blinders and of, of uh, compacity and pretentiousness that for me, a companies, uh, certainty or a little bit of hype. Hypocrisy also weaves its way through absolutism. And there's so much of it around us on television. Every talk show seems to have it. And in the real world, I'm always encountering people who declare things about the world I live in with the certainty that I just don't, don't see around me. And in my writing that shows. That's why the issue of truth appears so much throughout all of my books that I'm skeptical of. Well, what's declared to be true?

Speaker 2:          02:00          I don't think pride is the right word. I look, I look at the book now 20 years after having written it with a sense of dissociation. I find it hard to believe that those stories are mine and those sentences are mine. And in a way they aren't any longer. They're part of a world of literature. A book goes out and it takes on its own. I want to say it someone life, but it's the own, the about illness and identity that is divorced from the person who, who made it. And I feel sometimes even now, but like a fraud that I know I wrote the book and intellectually I know it, but, um, it to read, it surprises me at times, phrasal surprise me or an event will surprise me and come at me a bit, little bit as a stranger's voice does. And in a way, I am a stranger. The person who wrote that book, I'm 20 years older and I've had 20 years of, of new experiences, children and things I never had before that make that old voice seem old.

Speaker 2:          03:12          No, no way. It's life is eerily, and uncannily echoed that final chapter of the block where the timmy, that little kid at the end of that book was a forerunner to the author who wrote the book. It's an effort, uh, as the story says at the end of say, little timmy is life. I A little boy who grew up in a small cow town in southern Minnesota and found himself in a entangled and in Vietnam, but not just in Vietnam and in hard moral choices that it never had occurred to me I'd ever faced in my life. And the little naive lone ranger playing timmy that became that soldier in Vietnam was a kind of stranger to the guy who wrote that book, the the middle aged me. And just as now the author of the book seems a bit of a stranger. Um, by bid off, I mean, I, I'm not talking mysticism. I'm simply saying that, you know, 20 years is a long time to pass and, and uh, well when a sense of self changes, I think of myself now primarily as a father and secondarily as a writer and I've heard those words come out of my mouth. 20 years ago it would have been impossible. It didn't want, kids didn't think it would be very much fun, didn't think it would challenge me. I thought it'd be kind of bored by it. And now that is more of my life then, then a writing.

Speaker 2:          04:53          It's nothing intelligent behind it. That is, it wasn't a rationally planned operation, but rather it's how the world comes at me. He comes at me and a mix of my imagination coming over here to do this interview. I'm imagining will I meet and what will it be like? And I've never done a video interview before. And what will the physicality of the place be and all these and partly the real world. And I think that I'm not all that uncommon in that. I think we all live partly in our daydreams. And daydreams is the wrong word because it makes it sound syrupy and mystically I'd met, but I partly mean daydreams and I partly mean just thought or anticipation of event that hasn't yet occurred. And I think we all live there and you certainly live there in a situation such as a war where you're partly, uh, the reality of the world is in your face.

Speaker 2:          05:48          But partly there's the wistful call of girlfriends and home and all the things you don't have yearned for, where you're living, partly your imagination. I'm not in a war. And you'll flow in and out of these two the way you would maybe in a cancer ward or if your marriage is collapsing or your father has died or you're partly, he had the stark reality, that corpse in that coffin and you have partly remembering your dad's face as he threw you a baseball or were even more poignantly to, in my case, the wished that he were saying, I'm throwing you a baseball. Kind of the invented throwing of a what wasn't. So I guess what I'm saying is that I didn't like, like everything. I don't, I didn't, I don't, didn't plan in a cerebral way. The form of the things they carried, it took advantage of what was natural to me. I mean intentionally knew what I was doing, but I was taking advantage of what really is pretty natural to me. I live in at least those two worlds of imagination and a world we all live in.

Speaker 2:          06:59          Well through story. Essentially what you hope is that when you do what I do and you write novels, you're hoping for for a sense of feeling to come through in the end, that through nonfiction the brain is engaged and the head is engaged primarily not always just that, but primarily and with fiction telling invented stories. The hope is that through the story or read her lying in bed at night or you know, reading a book on the subway or the boss will sort of leave the bus and leave the bad and be transported to Madame Bovary, his bedroom and you're kind of as there half a witness and half a participant in a story. And my hope is that those who read the things they carried in my other books too, you hope that they'll feel sure. That identification thing that happens in a story where you're rooting for people are, you know, hoping the villain is cod or whatever your emotional take on there. You're in it. And not just observing it the way you observe CNN or you observed the Fox channel, let's discussed.

Speaker 2:          08:17          I don't think I've ever tried to resolve it. I think it's one of those things that kind of resolves itself when I speak about Vietnam or when I write about it, I'm not my own, uh, selfhood kind of evaporates. I'm interested in what's occurring on the page and I'm interested in what's going to become of these characters. And I'm interested in the moral struggles they're going through. And I don't, I'm not like my attention is on the making of a, of an object in a way, an artifact the way a sculptor may look it up, use of stone, and you may have a vision for what you want that stone to become, but part of what you do is it's the stolen kind of lead you to what it's going to become. Vain of minerals may run through it and then, oh, that's there. That could become this.

Speaker 2:          09:14          And that's been like writing fiction and a bit of dialogue may pop out of the character's mouth that's unplanned and unintentional on my part, I have no volition over. It seems to, uh, Peter, well I know that I'm coming from somewhere inside my head and my history and my imagination, but it doesn't affect, it doesn't feel as if I'm willing and I'm making it happen by volition. It's appearing. Uh, stories have a way of, of pulling you along, kind of chasing the story as you're writing it. And it, it, it doesn't feel as if I'm playing that old childhood game of connecting dots that they've all been planned and I'm just going to write sentences to connect it all. It feels more as if I'm on a, on a riverboat and watching people and scenery go by and a novel or a story has that feel of a, of a voyage in which I'm partly a participant in partly a witness.

Speaker 2:          10:19          I wish I could say yes cause it sounds so much big thinking, but it is the act of writing for me is largely the act of following sentences and making sentences. And for most people that probably is a time to click off and look at something else. But unfortunately for me, stories grow out of a sentence. For example, the sentence, this is true. Again, one of my stories I wrote the sentence was I had no idea of what, what was true. True. In what sense? I had no idea. And I wrote another sentence to follow that. But a buddy in Vietnam, he and Bob Kiley, well I'm discovering, I probably discovering and a partly just curious about, are fascinated about issues of what, what could be true and what does this character going to say is true and does this character really mean it? Does it really mean it's true?

Speaker 2:          11:20          And uh, to what degree does this character think it's true and how could anybody say this is true and real without a little tongue in cheek action going on? So it's a, it's a discovery. And what I think was one of my better stories grew out holy, out of the unplanned, out of a scrap of language is forgotten by readers. I think that are largely forgotten that that are 26 letters in the alphabet and some punctuation marks. And that's all we've got. And that is what I work with fitting in my underwear day after day, year after year, I was 26 letters. He's punctuation marks and out of that character is calm and moral quandaries are explored but in the end the work of writing and fortunately I was really the battling with Abcd and that's comma that so in calcitrant there are those and it doesn't, it's not a function of age and it probably wasn't even a function entirely of of uh, education or political leanings.

Speaker 2:          12:28          But there's a, there's a temper in probably America, but for sure I know in America and maybe worldwide for the literal, a literal take on everything that that reality TV is taken advantage of and incorporated as part of itself. And the literal take on things is a take without irony, without edge and without, it's usually a fairly, there's a certitude to it. Why don't you write a book that has nothing to do with war is that that's a certain possibility and you should certainly try to do it as a way of recovering from the war. And you want to say a number of things. This is not just a book about war, you idiot. And it's a book about love and a book about storytelling. But you also feel overwhelmed by, by the knowledge that you're not going to get through. That's the literal minded are going to remain literal minded and maybe someone else can help them, but that someone else, not, not this guy.

Speaker 2:          13:36          So there's a, there's a wave of anger or bitterness. It has to do with Vietnam, has to do with a kind of mindset of the literal all around me that doesn't fit my take on the world. It's a, in my experience in the world where it's hard for me to take anything very literally boards. I love you. I have there as soon as they're uttered, I'm suspect. How much and when will you stop and will you, um, in what way do you love me? And what is love to you, by the way, is that forever or is it still an ex, you know, person, passenger, all this stuff complicates where someone else's I will love is love. And if you don't know what it is, you're really, you're poor guy. And that's their take partly is to, I probably, I tried to skewer it at parody it, make fun of it, ridicule it and put it in his place.

Speaker 2:          14:38          Partly I'm, I'm sympathetic to the literal that is, I'm sympathetic with some mom is holding a dead kid in her arms and how else is she to take it? But here's my dead child. And so there's a part of me that understands it and is sympathetic to it. And probably the better part of me is that why, where I have that at least at least some capacity to, uh, asic much novelists kind of have to have to imagine otherness outside oneself. And as a consequence of my books are filled with characters who bear no resemblance to me and, and can be villainous in ways I'm not villainous. And it can be good in ways. I'm not good that I think the capacity for, for empathy or understanding goes with the successful book because you have to create other characters and other angles of vision on material for the, for a book to ring it ring with some kind of authenticity among my fellow soldiers in Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          15:50          I mean there was and remains to this day kind of absence of that kind of empathy or a dead child as a dead [inaudible] dead Vietnamese woman or one of their legs blown off was a woman with goop, with their legs blown off. And it pretty much remains that way these days, 40 years later, those same buddies I served with in Vietnam don't have much empathy for the, uh, so called enemy and I doubt they would be capable of because, because that's there, if you know, writing the things, they carried it write another book that wouldn't be a, it would be a much different book.

Speaker 2:          16:39          I ran into a kid in Seattle or kid, 26 year old, um, at a book that, a book signing and I saw him out of the corner of my eye standing in the corner and was kind of frightened by him. Not In physically, but I mean, Oh God, I hope it's not a manuscript he's got to give me and that which is hell of course to, and the guy that finally this reading Andoni hung around and I could feel him out of the corner of my eye approached me and he had me sign his book and I did. You began to leave and then he turned around and he said, I think he knew my father. And as soon as he said those words, I knew who the kid was. I saw it in his face, his cause he was dad and that kid's face who was my platoon leader in Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          17:26          Uh, and he told me over the course of the next, I don't know, 20 minutes or half hour that he had, the kid had been searching for his father ever since. His father committed suicide soon after Vietnam. And, uh, had looked for his dad in very brave, cool ways. He had joined the army just to see what his father had gone through, really become a green beret. As soon as dad had been a ranger, all this tuff snake eating, you know, the stuff. And he had picked up my first book and there's father figures in the book, not been always in the most laudatory way is in fact not in laudatory ways.

Speaker 2:          18:15          Well, that encounter, I mean, if we want to cry, if I weren't on camera, I'd be a little tears in my eyes now because it's an example of why I began writing in the first place. I don't want to touch people in a way that, that stories can touch him. And I had helped in a very modest way for this fellow to fill in a gap of who this man advantage committed suicide before they even knew his father. His father killed himself when he was very, yeah, I think it was like six months older, eight months, very young. Um, encounters like that. Remind me of why began. It's easy to forget why you, why you become a writer. Letters I'll get from me, the girlfriends and people in Iraq or Afghanistan or the children,

Speaker 2:          19:12          which all say the same thing. Basically. I don't know, my dad, he won't talk about it or my mom in some cases, but largely men. And we, I read your book and now I know at least something and when he's carrying around with them and what do you won't talk about. And sometimes the book will be shared with the veteran and conversation will ensue. And that is way beyond anything I intended hinder writing in that book. I didn't intend to bring people together or it's Darren, I'm talking. But it shows you the power of, of literature. It can, it really touches individual people realize and the real world and contributes to their lives. It does something to their lives. Uh, that, that's what I dreamed of. I began riding home, dreamed of touching some 15 year old kid and dubuque or some grieving mother. And you know, Harlem,

Speaker 2:          20:18          Eh, literature makes you feel if it's any good, it can make you feel a little less alone in the world. Someone else has gone through this and it gives you some late night company. Um, with your memories and your thorough literature is, does touch people. It's not just to be read in English classes. You can't physically put a person. I mean, I've, I've often thought of what a cool movie would be. For example, if you go to a war movie and they out of the screen come real bullets and you're ducking and you'd get a where it's not, you're not shielded by the knowledge that I'm not going to die in this movie house, or, or at least that's not, the bullets aren't going to do it. Um, and you can't do that, that, that you rely as you probably do in anything you're relying on, on the human, the reader or the audience's imagination to just sort of suspend the knowledge that I'm not going to die inside this book or at this movie.

Speaker 2:          21:28          But you have almost start to seduce the reader or the audience into almost forgetting that, almost forgetting that feel of danger and, and a good work of art. There's a movie called the Messenger that's recently come out about the, with Woody Harrelson and Ben Foster. It's, and it's not, it's a war movie and away, although none of it happens in war. It's the notification of next of kin where they knock on doors and say, your son's dad or your husband's gone. And although, you know, in the theater, it's not just, you know, they're actors and so on. There's a bluntness and a brutality in a horror to it that some of those way beyond John Wayne stuff and the actual war stuff, which has a, you kind of expect what's coming. And so Laura, people are going to die and you harden yourself to it and they do.

Speaker 2:          22:22          It's a different experience to watch those knuckles on the door and that fate door open. And if that face, that person die in front of you, that mother, um, that, that is, um, what are just for, that's what it's for. It's for cutting through rhetoric and cutting through politics and cutting through convention to, uh, open a trap door in your soul, the avowed purposes behind our or preemptive in more and Iraq or let's get rid of weapons of mass destruction. I think I'm pretty clear on my memory on that. Well, there weren't any, and it's a bit like, let's go to war because we were attacked at Pearl Harbor. It's a Pearl Harbor hadn't happened and I'm astonished that this large seemed largely forgotten. Seems are raced from the public discourse about the war. I don't hear many people going on television saying we went to war for reasons that didn't exist.

Speaker 2:          23:32          I don't, I don't feel any outrage coming from anybody I hadn't done. And I don't, not only do I not feel it now, I never felt it. Um, I find that stunning and I do here instead as well. We, we got rid of a tyrant, Saddam Hussein. The problem with that is that in the first place, that wasn't the reason we went to war. They didn't do know, didn't go before. The United Nations is saying let's get rid of a tyrant. He went before saying their weapons of mass destruction and there was no tyranny stuff there except in the most second hand and trivialized kind of way more. But beyond that, there's a thing called consistency. And there's another thing called hypocrisy. And if the object is to get rid of tyrants around the world, why aren't we nuking Red Shyna what we used to let the Republicans used to call Red China and why aren't we at war with half the countries in Latin America and why aren't we taking half the countries in Africa if not more than half?

Speaker 2:          24:33          Um, and there are no answers to those questions. Sort of Cherry pick your war and go get rid of that tyrant. And then there's the question of ty, ty origin, whose eyes, I mean, and what if for example, al Qaeda were to declare a George Bush is a tyrant and we're going to attack you or are we all going to say, okay, come tax us. It's okay to attack tyrants. Who declares that the tire. It is who we are. Well we have, we've been elected as a country to decide who the tyrants are and who the good guys are. Um, those are complicated questions and they're not addressed and not even looked at anymore. And, uh, it, it, that's part of where my frustration comes, I think in, uh, writing about this subject is I feel that things have been de elevated in that the discourse is aimed at a really low, low, low place and difficult questions are not just not answered. They're not even asked. And they aren't asked by, don't seem to have been asked by the people who uttering the bellicose rhetoric of war. You seem to be alighted innovated.

Speaker 2:          25:52          Um, and then there's the final issue that kind of attend your question, which is the issue of personal, I don't know how to phrase this, but a pr, a personal commitment to one's own rhetoric that the rhetoric of bellicosity that's or has surrounded, especially the initial phases of our intervention in the Middle East. These people aren't there. They aren't, I mean, you know, the, the Cheney's and the, uh, the public face and the public, uh, explainers of our presence in a, too often they're hiding their kids away at Yale or you know, or wherever and they're, they're not putting their bodies with their rhetoric is, it's one thing to sit in a TV studio, you're cute bow tie and say, let's go kill people. It's another thing to go and do it. And if you don't go send your daughter or your son, they got to go and they've got an, I just go there.

Speaker 2:          26:54          You gotta, you know, walk the streets and, and drive the vehicles and risk maiming and death and the hypocrisy of saying it's a great thing to go kill people. But if somebody, you go do it, I'm not, and my kids aren't, but you go do it. After having gone through a war myself, I find that that's still stirs in me in the same way it did 40 years ago. Uh, an anger that's hard to, it's hard to keep my voice under controls. I'm talking about it now. Um, because it seems so dishonest and so cowardly and, and uh, so evil than the end.

Speaker 2:          27:46          It is in part that and part to mimic our collective memories. All of us that, um, memories of strange thing that if you think about it, how much of today do I remember? Well, I could, it's already abstracted, but I've already hook, of course, utterly obliterated almost every syllable to come out of my mouth. It's gone. It's history. What about yesterday? I can't remember. Every dish I washed, every scab I picked, every rich person I encountered, it's, it's every meal. I ate three hundreds and thousands of them. And I would say that out of my life, 99%, probably a lot more than that. It's been erased that I'm, you know, biliterate it, erase canton. Remember a detail and I'm not just talking about childhood, I'm talking about adulthood and people I've cared deeply about it. And I remember them and loving ways and yet have a few snapshots of memory.

Speaker 2:          28:44          And we hold onto those and we call a memory. And that's memory, that little remnant of, of a lifetime. That's what's left to us. And we attach this word memory to it, which sounds has a sound of encompassing all but it doesn't and that's certainly applies to the things they carried. I mean it's a book partly about memory. The author of that book is an older guy and he's looking back and he's recycling event from different angles, sometimes inventing things as a way of seeking that which is, is gone. Uh, you, you've ghostly a good friendship. Merrick's who stepped on a landmine and was blown into this tree and uh, he's been dead a long and yet in their writing of the things they carried, I tried to in some way resurrect through imagination what his last thoughts may a man as he soared into that tree, there's sunlight is killing me.

Speaker 2:          29:54          I know I'm making it up, but I'm trying to sort of cast a light on that which has been darkened by, by a history and the passage of time to let chip keeps soaring, you know, use it. As long as that book is read, that Guy's going to keep soaring into that hedge for, you know, under that tree. And as long as the book is routed, Little Linda at the end of the book is going to keep skating on that ice and little timmy will be in love with her and the skating along. And that is what you don't, you're not. So I'm not saving their bodies and I'm not even saving the memories of these people really. But I'm saving something. I hope that's essential and enduring and the human spirit, the love of a little boy for a little girl and a good friend who soared into a tree and a terrible war.

Speaker 2:          30:54          And that's something, it's not everything, but it's something mostly pissed off. I mean, I'm a come down on that side of there's a mythology that accompanies the memory of an event. And by and large from my fellow soldiers in Vietnam, the mythologies of betrayal, we were betrayed by government. They didn't pursue it, were betrayed by the liberal press. Uh, it wasn't our doing. It was, they're doing the same way that after World War One, the Germans were preached to by the forces of, became Hitler. That, you know, you were betrayed after the end of world war on Germany was sold down. And by and large, my buddy's feel that why that a we could have won the war if only there were more people weren't killed and more women raped and more houses burned, we would have it. Uh, I don't think they're right, but they feel that way.

Speaker 2:          31:50          I don't, I think you could have paved the country with the concrete and put up a big fence around it. I used to have all these people who don't watch it. There you are Americans and were Vietnamese and this is our country. And you may have the concrete and the moms and the technology, but you're not gonna win us when us, you may have won a war in a way. Well, there's, I think there were mythologies of, of memory and my dad carried with him out of World War II mythology of America, the lone ranger and the doer of good and the carrier of democratic flame. And, uh, there was a head of undercurrent of a, almost a soundtrack of Frank Sinatra, Gene Kelly soundtrack running beneath it, of buoyancy and of, of virtue and the soundtrack that ran beneath the movie of Vietnam. You know, you know, and all your people are going to watch this smell was not that I'll be seeing you sentimental journey soundtrack. It was a soundtrack of the doors and the stones and it was an edgy and critical and, and a much more ambiguous, a soundtrack that more or less accurately reflected the ambiguities and the, the, uh, the absence of a certain moral underpinnings to that enterprise that, uh, so those are two pretty different edifices of what's called a mythology about a war and mythology as a way of eliminating all that doesn't fit into it. It doesn't, you sort of eliminate that part of it.

Speaker 2:          33:46          I think there's probably some truth in the notion that there is an insidious and dangerous side of the mythology that's surrounds Vietnam. It, it has a slight stink of the hip and of the cool of the, uh, walking the dangerous line. And the, uh, I think there's a, there, there was an exotic feel to the war and this far off jungle and that was part of them. The mythology around it, it sort of beckon is beckon is one a new to the adventure and we have my exotic experienced and dangerous moment that uh, that manages to erase the absolute horror of it all the dead people, the dead children and just the horror, um, that maybe part of what every writer about war is finally had to come to terms with in one way or another that they're pretty great books had been written, including the Iliad and the Odyssey that haven't ended wars and Evan did entity appetite for it and probably won't all you always hope.

Speaker 2:          35:06          Um, I this little son of mine who's now four, his name is tad and he, the week or two ago, yeah, I said I was going on a book tour and he said no about what, and I explained what the things they carried was and for the first time he had, he had encountered out of my mouth the word war in a personal way. That is probably heard me say it before he said war. I mean, you mean really killing people with for real. And so for real you said really? I mean really killed people that I began by saying and now people are getting in disagreements and trying to simplify it. But the astonishment on a four year old's face that people are killing one another man. He said, for what? And boy that was hard to articulate an answer to it. I didn't have a header. You're know, they didn't have an answer the answer I believe they had. And it was like, I don't know. I don't really know for what. Uh, I was, I was the lime of person who has thought about this stuff my entire adult life. I really haven't yet plumbed the for wetness of, of killing people. Um, I don't know. I don't think I ever will.

Speaker 2:          36:32          Plumbing one of the huge things, of course there's, there's no draft and the people are fighting, are in the armed forces out of volition and got her own, we'll decisions. And that's pretty huge. It attracts a certain temperament that wasn't mine. That kind of can do macho, adventurous, uh, temperament. Then of course, patriotism feeds in very strongly as well. Uh, that's, that's a pretty big difference from the people who went to fight. I mean, there were many volunteers. Of course I went to Vietnam, but there were, the bulk of us were drafted you, so probably more or less went reluctantly and, uh, and my case a lot more than less. And so the two wars are being fought by American soldiers. I need side that have pretty different temperaments. And I, for example, did an article offer a big magazine where I was sent to Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio where the terrible, uh, amputees or Sandton and burn victims, and I felt great compassion for these young men and one young woman, but auto, they're miles there.

Speaker 2:          37:55          There, there was, there was no, none of the irony that accompanied the war from my, my generation. Uh, there's no questioning of the rectitude of the war whatsoever. It was just, it wasn't even a thought about it for far as I could tell if I quit. No response to my question is, do you ever wonder about there were no weapons of mass destruction? Did that bother you? And the answer was in uniformly from many, many miles a flat, no, it doesn't bother me. Don't even think about it. But even that, don't think about it. It wasn't, there was just no, it doesn't bother me. Um, there was none of the edgy feel of questioning or of ambiguity was that certainty thing we began with. It was there and those young people's needs are horribly maim people, horribly wounded. But, uh, instead coming out of their mouths were, were words such as wounded warrior and war against global terror.

Speaker 2:          39:00          It was going to military sloganeering had, was part of their, who they were and that, that was one another one of the differences from my, from my time, one of the odd things when the guest, they, one of the great ironies is that the things they carried is a book is one of the things being carried around Iraq and Afghanistan and finding out that book is passed around from soldier to soldier. And which gives me a little bit of hope that at least they're getting something from another point of view and which was mine and that, that's, that's good for me.

Speaker 2:          39:46          I don't know enough. Um, I saw such a simple minded guy. I mean, I just assume that in most ways there's, there's no difference, uh, the faces here younger and the bodies are leaner and because like the habits are better than in my generation. Nobody smokes anymore or very few. Not Everybody. They know about the right foods to eat. Everybody looks a little sleeker than in my, or the girls look prettier and the guys look tougher and tougher, but buffer. Um, but aside from that, I mean, I'm like, fuck, I can hang out with college kids or people in their 20s and feel utterly at home and in, in a way that I don't think I could have felt at home where I 26 hanging out with some, you know, it was Kurt Vonnegut, her, I think I would felt ill at ease, but there was a poised among young people that, uh, really does astonish me, really astonishes me that way. People can, can uh, do something. I was so difficult for me, so I'm not sure what to say exactly.

Speaker 2:          40:58          I don't think I hate it. I fear it more than anything. It's uh, because you're, you're, you're put on the spot too, are articulate things about something in progress that, that have the danger of freezing you that as you say it enough times, I'm doing this and then you damn well better do it. He started telling yourself all, I've said, I'm going to write this book and it's going to be that kind of book and it freezes. It freezes you. Are you, you're reluctant to go beyond it or pushing another direction with the same book. Having said that, I, I know enough about what I'm working on to say that it's a book about being an older father. I'm 63 and I got these two young kids and I can say that it's about some of the stuff that I was writing about with the things they carried.

Speaker 2:          41:45          The sense of your own mortality is presses in on you in a war. You know, you know, you, you know intellectually you're going to die someday, but in a war you're reminded pretty often and it was right at you. And I feel that way is an older father. I imagine, where am I going to be 10 years from now? I mean, basketball is going to be tough and will I even be alive? And um, the two little boys or so, uh, no, nothing of tombstones and uh, no, nothing of the tick of biology are, you know, are facing it as I am. And there's a sadness to it that's has, that's accompanied by an exhilaration of the moments matter. And I got, I'm taking advantage of them, which is what I meant earlier about writing that I'd rather, I mean, I could die tomorrow and I as a writer be content with four or five of the books I've written as being good, but I can't die and be content about these two unformed lives or aren't. They're too young to be good. And I want to try to be there to watch him become good and to do what I can to help. And, um, so I'm writing with that, but it's funnier than that funder. Funny things in it too. And the discovery of language and, uh, the storytelling part of the book is about the stories I tell these kids. Um, there's sources, uh, partly in the world of now and partly in the world of long ago.

Speaker 2:          43:28          What do I carry? I carry a lot of years. I feel that our, that's not all bad. It's partly bad. I carry a, what I think I probably was probably come through in this talk we've had today as a kind of delight and in doing what I do and a believer in doing what I do along with a sadness about doing what I do. Um, because two decades later, I'm fielding many of the questions about war that I fielded all those years ago and said, mom, my God, you know, that sort of back where we were. And then some that that's feels like a tangible burden. Um, but I carry with me these two kids I mentioned. And even though they're not physically here, they are. They're all around me and the person I become and they're living inside me. And, uh, I carry a slight, uh, palpable feeling of obligation to, uh, do justice to the savagery I witnessed and the senselessness of it.

Speaker 2:          44:55          And, uh, the, um, the, the sadness of it and it would, so that sense of obligation is with me, especially on occasion is like, like this one we're doing, trying to talk lucidly about this stuff. After you do justice to chip, I muddy and to the ghosts of the dead Vietnamese and get Americans, especially their mothers and dads who are still bearing the burden, even though their kids are along that, I doubt they go to sleep many nights without some poor woman in Orlando or remembering or, or Sana 40 years ago that she never got the ever hold again and there. That's pretty solid, solemn obligation.
