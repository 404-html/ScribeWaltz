Speaker 1:          00:09          I think the most important thing then I have learned is it, there's more to learn that we should,

Speaker 2:          00:20          that we,

Speaker 1:          00:25          that we should all be hungry for a lifetime. I mean, for example, at my next birthday I'll be 68 all the great scientific discoveries made by all the great geniuses were largely made when they were in their twenties and thirties and yet I became about two years ago, obsessed with particle physics and I was determined to understand it before I died. I could not have done that if I hadn't learned to read when I was young, if I hadn't had the opportunity to study science courses in my high school. And I lived in the second poorest state in the United States, which most people my age and my state did not have. I happened to go to a bigger high school with people who

Speaker 1:          01:32          understood we had to get good science and math teachers there. And if I hadn't gone to, in my case, Georgetown University, which was a jesuit university and I hadn't been subject to the kind of rigors that the jesuits impose, which made me realize that however much I thought I knew and how real smart I was, I didn't know very much and I wasn't very smart. I had a lot to deliver. So that's the most important thing. I learned that your brain is a gift and we now know that people well into their late sixties and seventies can form new neural networks so that even though your brain begins to shrink and your thirties and does throughout your life stance, none of us ever use even close to half of our brainpower. We got a lot left and we will in our light on our last day on earth, we'll have a lot left.

Speaker 1:          02:24          So the idea that we now know as a scientific measure because of all the brain scanning technology that we can form these networks and that we formed them best were most likely to form new neural networks later in life by learning something new. So if I said I was interested in particle physics and also in astrophysics and I'm trying to figure out what it means that we've located 20 planets outside our solar system in the last five years, it seemed to have enough density and be far enough away from their sons that they might be able to support life. That may be the answer to the Russia Ukraine problem and attack from out an attack from outer space. We'll immediately unite us. All members of Congress in the U s will immediately start hugging each other and singing Kumbaya. But anyway, I can form new neural networks doing that cause I don't know anything about it or I did and when I started, a theoretical physicist would do better going to Suzuki piano lessons with his grandchild or her grandchild and just playing if you knew nothing about music. But this is an incredible thing that the most important thing I learned is that it's important to keep on learning that you should stay hungry and that their greatest gift can be even as your body begins to fail. If your mind is still working, you need to use it
