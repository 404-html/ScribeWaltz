Speaker 1:          00:08          I'm against regulations, so, so, uh, now, uh, yeah, I think that as long as we find a way to control, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the flow of money that goes, that would go to a, to uh, ill conceived initiatives and obviously you have to think about terrorism at this point. Uh, that's legitimate that we have mechanisms to make sure that, uh, that we have a way to track illicit or movements or suspicious movement of money. So this delicate balance here and this is being done as we speak. I mean probably more than we know or care to know. Uh, but other than that I think to regulate in the business sense of the word, I think that game, that would be a mistake because I obviously a convinced a capitalist not because it's the parent because it's been a CEO, not because it's, it doesn't have any drawbacks, but frankly we haven't found anything better. So to, to, to, to rise, you know, to raise the, the level of the one. So the road, the road to progress up to now is through a capitalistic system. If we could find something better, I'm wide open to it, I'm open to it, but we have not. So, and the essence of the capitalist system is that you don't want to regulate it or at least you certainly want to do the minimum to make sure that there's order is preserved and that again, no illegal or illicit a things are being done.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Huge change.

Speaker 1:          02:10          Um, you know, globalization has an, some well known, uh, I wouldn't say he shares but well known statements on this, you know, the world's flat. And so, which is true, I mean, to some extent, to some extent, it's true that the globalization has, as we have moved for me, national markets through a global market. So now people think they can play anywhere everywhere in the world and they are. And this has created a situation where large global company fairly acquired a, a or power, uh, that is very, very significant. Some of them have the citizenship to deal with this, the corporate values to deal with it. Some of them may not yet, but, but they are getting there quickly because they realize their responsibility on, in the world because of their presence. Uh, and uh, to some extent that has a, raised the awareness amongst the ceos of large global companies that global corporate citizenship is very important and they have to deal with that and they are, and they are, which is also one of the reasons they're form is successful at attracting this interest because that's when we talk about that.

Speaker 1:          03:39          So, uh, so that's one thing. The second thing is that countries have sort of lost a fair amount of power in this globalization evolution, uh, and uh, uh, because of this goes across nations. So this is, this is a change that's interesting to, to witness and uh, some countries react a smartly to this and some not so smartly, so, uh, but progressively inevitably, uh, this is going to go into the right direction because business is getting conscious of their responsibilities and governance are starting to our understanding how they can really deal with this phenomenon more, more effectively as an opportunity rather than a threat. Here's the big difference, of course, countries have gone to protectionist measures. Uh, I've tried to, uh, contain a, they are industry by artificial means and that's not, that's not the solution. The solution is to not to look at this as a threat, but to look at it as an opportunity and those who do pa successful,

Speaker 2:          05:08          okay

Speaker 1:          05:10          at this point are saying that, hey, we can argue whether we will or will not. And to what extent we have recession, putting her name on the economic slowdown is always sort of artificial. Here we started session is two quarters of negative growth. Okay. So that's an arbitrary decision, but so be it. If that's the decision, I don't know whether it will have that. Maybe we do, maybe we don't. I think it's a material to a large extent. We will come out of this and grow again. So it's only a temporary situation. Now I've saved this. Even if we have this, uh, the engines of growth in the rest of the world are powerful enough that I don't think this will trigger will recession at all. Uh, because the, uh, there was Korean economies are just unbelievable and uh, if China grows at 10 percent a year or nine percent a year, if just started grant six percent a year, I mean, this is still a lot of growth. So, uh, so I don't see, I don't see that as a problem at all. I think the purchasing power of Americans is decreasing and will continue to decrease. I think this is inevitable as a result of this global trend. Uh, so, so some of the other countries are raising to that level, coming to that level. I think, as I said earlier, the bigger problem is the income disparity between Africa and the rest of the world. I think this is, this, this property did a more serious issue on that particular question that in my view, we have. Yeah.
