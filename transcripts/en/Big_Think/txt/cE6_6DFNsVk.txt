Speaker 1:          00:00          I like this new wave of feminine crime fiction writers who are feminist but not in the upg politically correct way that feminism is an authentic feminism. You know, they don't have this pattern ising attitude. Like, you know, women, women should always be passive victims and so on. But even maybe now I will say something for rich, maybe I not be popular here even better than how she called Gillian Flynn or what is an Irish girl called Tana French? A theories of crime fiction taking place in Dublin with more or less the same spirit, the same attitude. A kind of a, if I have to invent some stupid title, a kind of a dark New York feminist, uh, uh, uh, crime thrillers. But know of the, of the movie that I recently saw, there is a problem. Often a movie attracts me, not attract me, but gives me to think intellectually, but I don't really like it.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Uh, as a movie for example, uh, the one, uh, her with your, when you know, uh, in the field at the end, she is the hero together with the girl, I think she's called amy, but they are both abandoned by their machines. The big enigma here is, and this is what always attracted me, and this is I think what my mentor in theory, French tracker and list Jacques Lacan in this, that in his crazy fees is there is no sexual relationship, which means we are never alone. Me and my partner, there has to be a third element as fantasy scene, an intruder. It's only through that mediation of a third element here in her, their operating systems that sex functions. And then I started to think about other variations of this. Like for example, a perfect there intelligently mate, 20 years old, British publicity for beer, which is a var, wonderful, ironic repetition of a old fairy tale motive.

Speaker 1:          02:28          You know, a young girl walks by a stream, she's a frog. And of course that's what you do in fairy tales. She picks up and kisses the frog and the frog into a prince charming young man. But then the publicity goes on. The charming Yank man looks at her, kisses her and she turns into a can of beer. You know, like that's what he really wanted, you know, and then I found here in the states, and similar but inverted versions, some pretty disgusting mentally publicity for Taco Bell publicity for something called Casa Ardito, which is Kisa Delia in Burrito combination of the two. And it's presented in such an obscene way that if you combine the two, it's really like a penis in wrapped by a vagina. But if, how is the publicity spot down here? Uh, a young guy and the girl see during lunch break at a table, one has guess ideally at the other Burrito and they look at each other and then you see each person's dream boy looks at her and imageries the future.

Speaker 1:          03:44          They start to talk, they get married, have children, then she looks at him, approach him in her dream and take his piece of Burrito or whatever. Uh, what apps keep apps that she gets a kind of a bisexual completing and just makes a sign and he disappears. You know, it's similar to that word beer, but what I think is the deep enigma behind all this. Why do we never get just a couple? Why it always has to be some intruders and the best Hollywood version of this, I ask all the viewers who are watching us now to to download, you can download it for free. It's an American classic movies, Preston Sturgis Lady Eve, where you have the ultimate marriage proposal scene. You have a Henry Fonda and Barbara stanwyck and a horse standing behind them and the horse's head is always intruding and so on and so on. That is the mystery of sex. It's never too, you always need something and imagined gaze, an element intruding and so on. And so on.
