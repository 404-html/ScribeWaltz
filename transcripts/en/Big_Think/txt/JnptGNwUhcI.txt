Speaker 1:          00:07          Because there is no mystery here and had worked together at the end for 11 years when you had, starting in the fall of 1956, we spent three, four years traveling the country together, just the two of us to every one of the 50 states and you get to know somebody and then his way of thinking and his way of speaking pretty well when you do it day after day in all 50 states for three years or more. And so the ideas were, his policies were his, the judgements and decisions were his. And when a, uh, express those decisions in the White House, it was not difficult to, for me having participated in the meeting to go a few steps down the hall to my office and try to reflect in words on paper the first draft of the decision he wanted to convey to the public. Well, I'm happy to say that, uh, I usually submitted it to the president's chief, uh, uh, domestic advisor.

Speaker 1:          01:24          That was me and I submitted it to the presidents of senior policy advisor and senior staff member. But that also is me. So being the modest about it, uh, basically I only had to savannah, to John F Kennedy knowing that the policy expressed in the paper was his policy and I wanted him to be comfortable with the words and he changed the, that paper or sometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot. Sometimes he would reject an entire paragraph. If I liked it, I might find a speech a couple of weeks later, I would try to sneak it back in. Sometimes he would recognize what I did.

Speaker 2:          02:14          Great.

Speaker 1:          02:14          That sense of satisfaction and pride. My parents were two dedicated Americans who brought me up to try to change the country in the world, try to make it a better place for all mankind. I was nobody. I was elected to nothing. But there I was able to help shape the words and even sometimes the thoughts of the leader of the free world. So, uh, do have him using the words on which I had worked a wasn't of course of satisfaction and pride.
