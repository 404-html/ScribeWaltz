Speaker 1:          00:11          Preserving economic interests requires trading and working with governments, like, for example, trying to, that violate human rights. And there are some who would say, well, you can't do both. You can't, um, go and talk to the Chinese about stabilizing, um, the global economy and the steps that we want them to take to, uh, to help us deal with, uh, obviously a, an existential economic crisis and at the same time lecture them about their treatment of dissidence for prisoners or the Falun Gong or Tibetans or what have you. I don't think that's right. I think that the United States and countries like trying to work together on economic matters because it's in their mutual interest to do so. I don't think China or any other country works with us on those issues, um, to do us a favor. They do it because it's in their interest to do so as well.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Um, so I don't think we damage ourselves diplomatically if we stand up for our principals so long as we do it in a intelligent way. Um, and that's the challenge of diplomacy. It's, it's doing more than one thing at one time. And any secretary of state, um, or any president, um, who is up to the enormous challenge, uh, of those jobs should be able to do that. Um, and I also think that it's unrealistic to think that, uh, that we can simply drop those issues. You know, you can go into a meeting with the Chinese and say, you know what, we're, we're, we just can't afford to raise the case of that dissident. We can't afford to lecture them about the port Tibetans because we've got to save the global economy. And then three months later, something awful is going to happen in Tibet. And guess what?

Speaker 1:          02:17          The United States government is going to have to say something about it because it would be politically impossible not to. And then the Chinese having seen the pattern of silence become even more upset. They'll say, where does that come from? We thought you weren't talking to us about that stuff anymore. And the diplomatic costs are even greater. So I think for, you know, realistic diplomatic reasons, it's better just to be principled and consistent and send the message out to every country that we work with around the world. You know, that's just part of doing business with the United States that we're going to raise those issues. It's because it's who we are. It's what we believe.

Speaker 1:          03:03          I Dunno about self determination, but sovereignty, a state sovereignty is often used as an argument against intervening to stop human rights abuses. Um, and it's a complicated set of arguments. Um, but certainly in cases where you have extreme violence against civilians, um, the threat or reality of mass killing and genocide, I believe in, in fact the United Nations has adopted a principle of responsibility to protect, to deal with those situations. That if, if a state is failing and it's responsibility to protect its own people from those kinds of abuses, then the rest of the world has a responsibility to step in in whatever way may be effective. Now, what if we're talking about, um, less extreme violations of human rights torture or a newspapers being closed down or people being in prison because of, um, because they're expressing their views. Uh, you know, I think very few people argue that those cases merit military intervention, uh, invading a country to take down it's government.

Speaker 1:          04:17          But there are other tools that I think are appropriate to use to pressure countries to change their behavior, uh, partly because it's the right thing to do, partly because there are legal obligations being violated when governments violate human rights in those ways. And partly because we have a self interest in, um, as Americans, uh, in, in building a world in which governments treat their people better than a lot of reasons for that. So, um, so I don't think that sovereignty is an absolute bar to one country or one group of people, um, promoting human rights beyond their political borders.

Speaker 1:          05:08          The United States can't be an effective champion of human rights anywhere, if it's a generally seen around the world as a violator of human rights. And so when the Bush administration was not just engaging that justifying practices like torture and disappearing people in secret prisons and long term detention without charge, uh, it, it was very difficult, not impossible interestingly, but difficult for the United States to effectively urge other countries not to do those things. I do think, although I'm critical of some of the things that the Obama administration has done, that, that he has gone a long way towards, uh, not just eliminating those practices but convincing the world that they are being eliminated. I think this is actually a moment, uh, perhaps a rare moment when, um, the United States government and particularly the president has a lot of moral credibility to, um, go to the world and champion and end to torture and, um, fair trials for everybody and freedom of the press and freedom of speech. Uh, that moment may not last, but we do have a moment like that now and it's important that it be used effectively and wisely.

Speaker 1:          06:30          Technology can be used to suppress human rights and to facilitate human rights. That's always been the case. Um, there's never been one technology that, uh, is beneficial only to one side and that struggle. So governments like China and Iran can use the Internet to monitor, uh, the, you know, their people's communication, um, to try to identify dissidence, um, and go after them individually. But of course, um, campaigners for democracy and human rights can also use these technologies as we saw in Iran, um, to get around government restrictions on speech. And it's a, it's a tug of war between the, the dark side of the Internet and the, and the good side. Um, and there's a lot that the United States can do to, uh, to help the, the good side when in that fight. Um, for example, there are really interesting technologies being developed that allow people to communicate privately, um, to defeat surveillance and to defeat censorship, um, programs that can be downloaded, um, by folks in Iran and China and Burma and Vietnam.

Speaker 1:          07:47          Um, and it's something that we've asked the US government to, uh, to fund and support. There's also, um, a very interesting and ambiguous role played by a American technology companies like Google and Yahoo and Cisco. Um, these are the companies that develop these liberating technologies that, uh, dissidents in Iran and China use, but they've also sometimes partnered with the governments, um, to give them, um, the technology they use to suppress dissent. Um, they've censored their own content sometimes. And so helping these companies figure out what their responsibilities are when they are operating in dictatorships and backing them up when they have to stand up to those governments is a really important challenge for the 20th.
