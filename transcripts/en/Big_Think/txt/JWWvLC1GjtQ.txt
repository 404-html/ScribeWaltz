Speaker 1:          00:00          Sustainability is a really broad scope of, of dealing with, with conflict or with issues or challenges that come across, um, in the more developed countries, you know, we'll look at how we avoid abusing the environment and how we can build a buildings in a green sustainable standards and we're very advanced on that, on that side. But if you go to Africa to countries, um, you know, like Uganda and Nigeria and Ghana and if you go to Central America, you know, the basic needs of sustainability sometimes is to teach the basic hygiene for, for children, giving them a toothbrush and, and, and explaining them how to cross the roads for safety, which is something that they're not familiar because they live in distant and rural Arrow and working with the community around what is important for them as part of their sustainability, how they build their capabilities over time.

Speaker 1:          01:12          Whether again this is more of a health care issues, education around topics and we embrace the environmental issues into these, these ideas, but in a very soft way. So there is a big difference for sustainability in the developed or in the third world countries. And in the developed world, we're doing these big water project in the Bahamas. It's a $90,000,000 project on reducing water leakage in the system. Over 10 year period, we will reduce the water leakage from 50 percent to 25 percent. And we've been doing a lot of work around education of people working with schools, working with children about the importance of water, about the importance of saving water, about creating the awareness of why water or are so crucial in our life. Why clean water are so crucial in our life. This is sustainability for these specific citizens in this specific area of the world. So you can combine the message according to what you do and according to what the people on the ground needs and these things being been very successful. You can save a lot of money, not only water, but a lot of money for these schools and for these families. If you make and create the awareness and education programs around that.
