Speaker 1:          00:10          In the sense that everyone understands what it is and there's no one who's hasn't been touched in some way. A mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend. We're not starting with, let me tell you what breast cancer is. Everyone knows about it. It's come out of the closet. There's no stigma. It's very different from what it was when Evelyn started. And I think everyone wants to be supportive either because they've had a personal experience or almost for an insurance policy. If I do support it, then maybe I won't have that personal experience. So it's an easy subject to broach with people and people are incredibly responsive.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Mostly

Speaker 1:          00:53          the money that we have raised, we have waste in the United States though. We have disbursed it internationally. So we have added on grantees now in Canada, France, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Italy, the Middle East and Latin America. For the most part, we're still deriving the bulk of our money in the United States. Um, though we've had some wonderful help from companies and, and estee lauder up in Canada. Um, and some programs in the UK for the most part, the money has been derived here because the tax incentives for philanthropy that existed in u s don't exist elsewhere.

Speaker 2:          01:36          No.

Speaker 1:          01:36          You know, the amount of money is, has, has at the very best stayed flat. And if you factor in inflation, it's decreased. The whole NCI budget for cancer is 5 billion, which may sound like a lot, but when you look at what the tobacco industry spends about 15 billion advertising cigarettes to teenagers or the pet food industry spends about 14 billion advertising pet food. Um, it's a small drop in the bucket in all about 11 billion is spent on cancer research across the NCI, the National Cancer Institute, pharmaceuticals and private organizations like the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. So it's not a lot of money in the federal budget has certainly diminished, if anything. And, and the pity is that there has never been a moment in time when knowledge, scientific knowledge is advancing at such a rapid clip. It's a hungry animal. So that if you could feed it, the answers will come more. Click quickly. Dr. Larry Norton at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who is our scientific advisor and has been since the inception of the foundation, says truly the only thing that stands between today and it is money.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Tough question. I don't what inspires the herb. Kent, if I knew the answer, I'd be, I'd be very smart. I don't what inspires the government. Um, but obviously there have been other calls on the, the federal dollar as you know, um, the war and other things. And one can only hope that under new leadership there might be an enrichment of the federal coffers. Because right now if you are a researcher, you spent half the year writing a federal grant and you have only a slim percentage of chance that that will get funded. Only 8% of approved grants actually get funded. And the pity is then there's a brain drain. People are actually leaving the field in droves. They get this tremendous education. They have the vision, they have the drive. But if they can't get the dollars to move their research forward, they can't pursue what they've been trained to do.

Speaker 1:          03:39          We try to put dollars private dollars in the hands of researchers who have new ideas often to help them get the base data that will make them competitor for the limited federal dollars. It's like a chicken and egg. You can't compete for the dollars until you have the data. You almost have to finish your research or know the answer before you can start. So an organization like ours plays a critical function, often teen people up to compete for the limited dollars and often moving research forward that might otherwise language for decades can.

Speaker 1:          04:17          my tin cuff. And where you and where you contribute? Well first of all, because I know we're on the side of the angels, I know we're doing good. I know we're making a difference. Um, I'm not asking for myself. People always say to me, what's the key to being a good fundraiser? It's being able to ask in a way that people can say no, and the doors open for you to come back. It's asking in a collaborative fashion. Um, and so how has our success come about? We're very attentive to retaining our donors, cultivating our donors, stewarding rs owners, and growing the average gift size and was equally as [inaudible] in acquiring new donors. And if you do both and you don't have a drain at one side and you're new and, and you never grow because your new one simply replace. We're very dedicated across the board. I like asking for money, not for myself, but this is for a good cause. I like doing, it fires me up. And Evelyn Lauder, who is the founder and chairman of the foundation, is as, as dog in and dedicated as I am. She's also smart, appreciative, and a wonderful colleague. So it's very motivational when you work for somebody whose heart and soul into this with you and a partner, a true partner. And we do it together with zeal and with success in your job.
