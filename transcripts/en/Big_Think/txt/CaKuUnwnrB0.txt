Speaker 1:          00:08          Why is it the greatest challenge facing both parties? Fundamental change. You can live in a lot of moments in American history where the is you're born into and the world's you governor that vastly different and they're always different 30 or 40 years past. You know, things are gonna change in a country. But uh, but that said, you know, you can there if you were, if you were born at a certain point in the 20th century after, you know, the, after the Great Depression and you were governing in the 1960s or 1970s, you know, the world was, the economy was pretty much the economy it was supposed to be. It was run by an industrial engine. The world was still divvied up among states who did, you know, menaced each other only or, you know, sign treaties and didn't manage each other. I mean, the world was pretty much the one.

Speaker 1:          00:51          You had telephones and you had television, you had nicer televisions and you had cable TV. But people were still communicating with one another and much the same way. And they were still posting letters by hand and sending them in a mailbox, you know? Uh, and then you have a moment like this where, uh, where, where the world is just vastly different than it was 30, 40 years ago. And in a sense, we're caught between moments, right? We're in between this industrial age and what comes next because we still have vestiges one foot in the past, vestiges of the past and one foot there and one foot in the future. So the challenge for the Democratic Party or any party has to lead the way into that future is to articulate what, what government and the economic engine and foreign policy of a country are going to look like.

Speaker 1:          01:29          Uh, in the era where none of those things are operable anymore, when the economy is nonindustrial driven, where people communicate with each other all over the world in a flash, right, where people expect to have options and choices in their lives where the threats that, uh, affect the world are not necessarily states to states, but a bunch of people who can communicate on the Internet and do a great deal more damage than a general in some country. Can. You know, this is, this is a whole new landscape and when I'm coming around to the view that, um, it's too much to ask, it's just too much to ask of a generation, uh, born into a different world to govern in this one. I think the baby boom generation has done what it can. Uh, um, I, I don't, I don't, I don't indict them as, you know, selfish, worthless people. I just think it's, it may have been just too much to ask a generation born in the 1950s to figure out how to govern in the, in the year 2007 or 2008. And I, I'm not, I'm coming around to the view that leadership and real leadership and real change and real evolution of government, we'll, we'll have to wait for another generation.
