Speaker 1:          00:02          Well, um, my recent visit to Congo to the eastern parts that is the north and South Kivu revealed that there is still a rather unstable situation, uh, in the east. And um, this was a followup to the atrocities in the valley color territory. I'm late August, beginning of September, and um, I withdraw the worried to visit some of these villages because I'm still. People are traumatized and I'm in a kind of, in a state of shock, I would say, uh, not only that, but they fear that their attackers might come back or even that the deployment of a government troops in this area might mean that they also have to live off the population. They are deployed there without enough to eat, without pay, without a barracks. So it means that they are afraid that they will have to, that they will start to loot and pillage this, these villages as, as well.

Speaker 1:          01:14          And then we can assume rape. Unfortunately, this is actually a, an area where a close to the mining mining activities. So the BCA, a mining district. So it means that, uh, some of the men from this small villages probably work in the, in the mining business or to support the mining business, but very often these small minds or controlled by rebel groups or sometimes, uh, by, by government troops as, as well. And um, it means that it's a very sort of unsafe situation for, for civilians. And uh, unfortunately this is something that fuels the, the ongoing conflict and some of the rebels. So it leaves the civil population very exposed and under a kind of constant stress.

Speaker 1:          02:22          Well, everybody said the same thing. They want peace and they hope that piece will bring peace also to the women. Um, this is not, we cannot be sure that it brings peace to the women because when this is done at the scale that we saw in the editor, oratory and in these villages, uh, unfortunately it brutalizes the whole society. It's been sober on the civil society. And that means, um, you know, a new generation of young men and boys will also think that, that this is a, a natural thing. And women don't feel that they have that they are valued that they. And one young woman said to us that she. Her impression was that she was of course very distraught, but she said, I a dead rat is worth more than the body of a woman. And, and I think this just shows that at the moment the women who are very much the backbone of the economy of the DRC are just sort of not valued. They are, they are broken. And that means also it will be so much more difficult to build peace and any kind of economic development in the DRC.
