Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          nuclear power nuclear power that we have now, it's called second generation nuclear power. Um, it's um, it's a comparable in cost to coal. Once you have the nuclear power plant, then the fuel is very inexpensive, so nuclear power is quite inexpensive, but it's difficult in the United States to get a nuclear power plant and build and it takes so many years that it drives the cost up. So now in England they've realized that they will need to have nuclear power in the future, so they've put a limit once a government commission decides on where the power plants will be built, the public will have one year to object to this and possibly get some changes, but they can't drag it out six or seven years the way it happens in the United States because that drives up the price tremendously. And there's also the possibility for fourth generation nuclear power. That's a technology which allows you to burn all of the nuclear fuel.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Presently, nuclear power plants burn less than one percent of the energy in the nuclear fuel. Fourth generation nuclear power allows the neutrons to move faster so they can burn all of the fuel and furthermore it can burn nuclear waste so it can solve the nuclear waste problem, and the United States is still the technology leader in fourth generation nuclear power in 1994 Argonne National Laboratory now called Idaho National Laboratory was ready to build a fourth generation nuclear power plant, but the Clinton Gore administration canceled that research because of the anti nuclear sentiments in the Democratic Party, what? Well, we are still have the best expertise in that technology and we should develop it because it's something that we could also sell to China, India, because they're going to need nuclear power. They don't are not going to be able to get all of their energy from the sun and from the wind.

Speaker 2:          02:29          The most effective one is energy efficiency. We waste a lot of our energy. We can get vehicles that get more miles per gallon there. There are many ways to improve energy efficiency. In fact, some states are twice as efficient as other states. Just because fossil fuels were so cheap, we just didn't pay attention to how effectively we were using them, but in addition, they're renewable energies, solar energy, wind energy, and I think that nuclear power has to be part of the solution because at this time it's the only alternative to coal for baseload electrical power, and we do now have the technology for a much safer and more efficient nuclear power as compared to the old versions that were used in the past several decades.
