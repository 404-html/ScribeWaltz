Speaker 1:          00:13          Our brains are cunningly evolved cunningly designed to make life easier for us and many ways that it makes life easier for us. But one of them is that it, it gives us over simplified versions of, of, of what we're doing. Uh, uh, this is a set of tricks which has been a sort of reinvented by software engineers. Your desktop is a pretty good case of it. We have these, you know, little little yellow files that can be moved around with click and drag and, and things get put here and there. And this is called the user illusion and it is a losery to some degree, but of course it's a very benign illusion. It's really, really, uh, it's a helpful way of organizing a lot of complexity. We don't need to know all those details. We just need to know how to achieve certain effects.

Speaker 1:          01:06          And basically our brain does the same thing and has, has been doing it for Millennia. Uh, it's got its evolved, some sort of internal signposts that are a good shorthand for things that, that we can do everywhere we look. There's things we can do. We don't know how we do them. Uh, we're, we're completely cut off from, from the process. If, if I say, um, uh, uh, you know, give me the first line of limerick makeup, the first line of a limit, well, you know, give me a few seconds and you'll come up with two or three. How'd you do that? You don't know.

Speaker 1:          01:46          The words just come sort of bubbling up and you don't have any insight into the sort of subterranean unconscious processes that generates that particular district. You may have a little insight, but not much. And it's, there's a very sharp limit to the depth that we as conscious agents can probe our own activities. And this, uh, this, uh, sort of superficial, uh, access that we have to what's going on. That's what consciousness is. Now when I say, well, who's this? We, who's got this access? That's itself part of the illusion because there isn't a sort of boss, uh, part of the brain that's sitting there, uh, with this limited access that itself is, uh, is, is part of the illusion, but it is, is a bunch of different subsystems which have, uh, varying access, the varying things, and that conspire in a sort of competitive way to, to execute whatever projects it is that their, uh, in their sort of mindless way.
