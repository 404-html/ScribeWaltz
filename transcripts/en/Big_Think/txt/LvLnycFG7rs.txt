Speaker 1:          00:06          My inner revolution book. Yeah. I still think that definitely, but we're just subverted that we're, we're under the control of warmongers. That's a moment of war criminals.

Speaker 2:          00:16          They are controlling us and taking all the money and taking all their energy and had, they've controlled the media propaganda vehicle and so on. They've turned it into basically and uh, so, but, but they are kind of desperate though because they had been had but they're not getting anywhere and the people are getting more and more sick of it and the, and the people are, have been for fooled into it and frightened into it in various ways. But I think that's kind of, it's like it's the darkness before the Dawn. They, I think the people will really refuse at some point at this rate, you know, because um, you know, the Cold War and they were kind of happy in the Cold War, these criminal people because they had a big enemy that they could promote that they were afraid of. They were very unhappy at the end of World War II because we won.

Speaker 2:          01:03          So therefore they was no need to always in American history before that. As Gore Vidal brilliantly says, we always demobilized, but in 47 truman and others decided that they would create this enemy and the Russians are former great allies who helped us beat the Germans. Actually in the Italian was really good Russian, we're a major factor and they were our major allies and suddenly it turned them into the devil and the a threatened them with nuke our nuclear weapons, which then caused them to like build up nuclear. Then we could have an arms race for them. Then make them an enemy. Then have all these proxy wars and the happy days for the military have 40 years of cold war. Then finally it stopped and they didn't know what to do. They're doing Bush one no more cold war, no more things. They, even Bush one had the temerity, the old warrior, a CIA guy that he is to say we might have a peace dividend and he's talking there to all the poor people in America, all the people with no decent roads and schools and train systems and all the horrible way deteriorate it infrastructure that the u s now is a victim of like a fourth world country.

Speaker 2:          02:08          And, but no, there's no peace dividend because the old secretary of defense, you know, Darth Cheney writes up a big program for world conquest. And so everybody's our enemy. Sadly then. So it's even better. We only had the Russians before and now suddenly everybody is our enemy. And then it's got to find some people, okay, let attack Iraq little attacks here and there and we'll conquer from Iraq to central Russia, you know, and get all the oil. You know, I mean, it's ridiculous thing he wrote in 1991 which they'd been doing now in 2000 with the poor, the poorest son who was just a party animal who just, you know, wants to sniff coke and have fun. And they just put him up there and he's like going like this and they don't here's know what he's doing. And he's leading the charge of these complete World War II lunatics who are criminals really basically themselves, their war criminals.

Speaker 2:          02:57          But my point is that that the incompetence of their way of going about it shows how desperate they are because the system that they sit astride of is no longer functional. Do you know what I mean? It a hundred years ago, 200 years ago in the time of imperialism cleansing and you could win a war, and that's defined by von Clausewitz wage, the war theorists as meaning you now don't just beat the enemy's army. You then make the enemies population do what you want, and you have a colonial empire and they produce goods for you and they do things for you because then you can subdue them. But nobody can seem to anybody now. They just don't get subdued. Even so much, you guys, we saw that and be numb, but you guys wearing silk, black little pajamas running around in pajamas kicked us right out of their country. We were, people were falling off the side of ships in Da Nang harbor, falling off helicopters and stuff. Bunch of guys in pajamas.
