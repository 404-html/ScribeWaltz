Speaker 1:          00:04          I sort of interesting fact is that while today programming is viewed as the extremely male dominated field, it was totally the opposite at the dawn of computing. All programmers of uh, uh, from the very beginning where women had, and it was because this job was seen as being beneath men. Uh, and, uh, so somehow in the interceding 30, 40, 50 years that's come Jack Gender Dynamics has completely shifted around. But what we're seeing now is that sometimes it's the implicit biases that we have, which are holding back women and minorities from entering the workforce and, uh, either as data scientists or, uh, or as computer, uh, engineers and software engineers. And we've seen a lot of research in this area that's shown that there can be some implicit biases that, uh, and how we judge people once we know about, uh, their ne, uh, from their name, their sort of their gender or their race.

Speaker 1:          01:07          And what we do right when we assess the people who were going to be working for us is we are completely blind to these things. We actually strip away the name when we consider people, um, applications. We just look at how they perform on a series of challenges that we give them that really try to test their ability to, uh, be a data scientist and test their understanding of these kind of core fundamental mathematical and programming concepts. And, uh, when we do that, I think it actually becomes a much more fair process, um, and it actually can help increase the number of women and underrepresented minorities, uh, in, uh, who sort of make it through the screening process. Just to give you one sort of quick anecdote about this, uh, there's a famous story about music auditions in the 1970s where orchestras had a very, very tiny percentage of their members or their, uh, uh, their players.

Speaker 1:          02:08          They're the people who are playing in the orchestra, uh, as women. And what happened, uh, is at some point they decided to try to break free from this and they will put down a curtain between the performer and the artist, the auditioner and the judge judging panel that was trying to determine whether these people should be allowed to play in the orchestra. And when they did the results were night and day. There's a famous study of, um, that's up on, uh, the National Bureau of Economic Research's websites, uh, published by two famous researchers from Harvard talking about this. It's called a orchestra in diversity. And it talks about how the results were night and day difference, uh, that women, the fraction of women who made it past the screening round shot up something like seven fold, uh, uh, between, uh, not having the curtain down and having a curtain down and it just goes to sort of show that's at this time there was an implicit bias that women weren't really the kind of caliber of musician that you needed to be able to perform at a Carnegie Hall. Uh, right. Uh, at these kinds of top, uh, that's kind of top level, some phonic performance. And when you put down a curtain and you just listened to them as opposed to being able to see whether they were a man or a woman, uh, you then without that kind of knowledge, you suddenly were forced to make judgments just based in the music, just based on their ability. And you saw that they w, uh, the, that you are much more willing to let in women than before.
