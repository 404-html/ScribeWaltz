Speaker 1:          00:02          Again, I'd have to say

Speaker 2:          00:05          the first thing everyone should ask themselves is what does it mean to be realistic and is realistic, the same thing as resigning. The second thing is to acknowledge that more is possible in your life that almost anybody ever told you, and the third is to think about the following thought experiment which was brought up by content. It's so it's. I find it very helpful, carved in discrete terms. This was the 18th century. He asks us to imagine a man who cannot resist, says he can't resist temptation. Every time he walks by a certain house, I mean it's a brothel, but if you put a gallows in front of the brothel and he knew that he would go to be hung, the minute he walked out, he would find that he could resist temptation very well. Okay, so we all agree that love of life trumps every other physical desire that you have.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Whether it's for sex or food or whatever form of pleasure does it for you. Love of life is the basis of every other pleasure. Then imagine the same man is asked to sign a letter condemning an innocent person to death and he's threatened by an unjust tyrant with death himself, unless he cooperates in the innocent man's death. And what concept is is none of us know what we would do in that situation. Most of us would probably be cowards, but all of us know what we should do and all of us therefore know that we would be free to do the right thing and to refuse to participate in injustice even if it would cost our own lives. And I think furthermore, I think everybody can perform that experiment. I've tried it out on a number of people. I think furthermore that everybody has one hero either in real life or in fiction, who they would like to be in at least one moment.

Speaker 2:          02:16          You may think you can't live up to that person, but you have one person who you think would act rightly in that situation. I think we should keep those people in mind. Of course, hopefully being a good person doesn't involve sacrificing your life and in fact, sometimes it's easier to be good and rather banal and simple way is that it is to go out in one great heroic gesture. So I think the last thing in being a good person that's important to remember, if evil can be banal and I think it can be goodness is also, but now to it consistent, ordinary, everyday action.
