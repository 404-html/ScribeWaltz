Speaker 1:          00:00          The way it's worked into my life, curiosity and making movies and television shows, it's enabled me to be a better curator of what's an original idea. I think our first reflex is to go to the Internet as opposed to seeking out new people to meet because that's really a disrupting your comfort zone. I mean, every time I do this, um, it's challenging. It's just that isn't going to be your natural reflex. Your natural reflex is going to go to google a subject, Google the person, oh, yet I am Deb, and that isn't how it's going to work. But what you want to do is you want to try to figure out how extraordinary people become extraordinary. Do I think kids normally just go to the Internet and just stop there? Probably because you are getting out of your comfort zone. Meeting a new person. If you treat it as an act of generosity that you are wanting to share part of your life with somebody, it will reduce your anxiety.

Speaker 1:          01:10          When you reach out to somebody, you go beyond just asking you a question. You might give them a piece of information. Like when I've met some famous designers like Vivienne Westwood, I come to Vivienne Westwood immediately with an olive branch. I immediately say to Vivienne Westwood, what do you think of this new soundtrack? Or what do you think of this piece of music? Because look, designing it goes hand in hand with music. I mean, you know, music is going to be some compatibility to fashion. Ultimately what I'm trying to do is find a way to intersect with how their psyche it actually works. So what I'm trying to do is understand very quickly what is it that they are going through emotionally because emotionally what they're going through is going to relate to what they do and achieve professionally. And what's deeper than that, um, is what do they think is their purpose in life? What is valuable to them? I mean, what has meaning in their life? I made it probably the deep truth of, of what we're trying to understand within our solar system as human beings and even as we try to get outside of our solar system. What is this all about?
