Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          yeah, it's definitely a growing trend. Um, there's always been a connection between philosophy and science. In fact, in the beginning there was no distinction, so aristotle was a philosopher. He was also a biologist. He was also an economist, um, and in a way he was a physicist, so yeah, but it is coming closer together again. And I think the reason for this is that, um, you know, scientists are studying things of great interest to philosophers like, uh, the scientific study of free will that really got going. I'm not until the 19 eighties when these Liberte experiments that I talked about started up, um, there's been a lot of good social psychological work on things like weakness of will and self deception for well more than decades. Um, and I've been interested in that stuff since I was young. Um, it is growing I think. Yeah, because there's more scientific done a work done now on these philosophical topics.

Speaker 2:          01:10          Um. Oh, I don't know what else it might be that people are thinking. Well, traditional philosophical methodologies have been around for a long time and they've gotten us to a certain place and that's good, but we can get even further faster by bringing more on board, you know, scientific results. Um, and, uh, I actually do a lot of work with scientists. In fact, I think I can mention this now. I'm, I'm about to receive a four point $8,000,000 grant to start a freewill project at Florida State University where I am. And, uh, the granting agency is the John Templeton Foundation. Now, most of the money will go out in grants to scientists and others who make proposals on free will a two point 8 million that's going to go out to the science of freewill. And what I'd like to see happen is that we have teams of neuroscientists, social psychologists and philosophers working together, uh, to design a freewill studies and then, you know, write up the papers, analyze the results and so on. Um, so for me this is a really exciting time, uh, at the intersection of science and philosophy and, uh, this thing called experimental philosophy, which didn't really exist until 10 years ago has really taken off. I was up here in New York City last Monday, um, to be in a session on experimental philosophy. There was a big audience, a lot of excitement. Uh, so in 10 years it's gone from nothing to something pretty exciting.
