Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13          well having been part of a military during the time of a draft and then having been part of the defense establishment when the all volunteer force was, was coming in, there's no question in my mind the AVF is head and shoulders above a draft. Uh, these young men and women are fantastic. I don't know if I'd have been worthy of them as a young officer there that good. Uh, but we're on the sec just starting the second generation of the all volunteer force. This is going to be very interesting experience and I don't know how it's going to going to come out. Clearly having an all volunteer force is one of the things that has kept public scrutiny of the war, uh, down, uh, somewhat. Uh, I do think having said that, that there is a place in our society for sort of mandatory service, not necessarily military service because I think it's a good thing to give to the country and I think it's a good leveler. A people of all religions, races and creeds can come together and sacrificed together and give back to this country for a year or two. Uh, I think that'd be a great thing, but I don't foresee a return to the draft as being a desirable possible unless we were faced with a major catastrophe.

Speaker 2:          01:30          Oh, I, I, I encourage them to do it. I'd be very enthusiastic about it. Uh, as I say it is, uh, the young men and women who go, they find that they're part of something bigger than themselves and uh, I think this makes them on the one hand feel that they're part of something worthwhile, but on the other hand realize, uh, that we're all part of something larger, uh, and that when you see that you can do your part within that context, I think it makes you a better citizen all around. I think it shapes you very well for a future workforce.
