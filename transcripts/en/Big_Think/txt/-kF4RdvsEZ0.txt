Speaker 1:          00:03          Finding a government that is more responsive to, uh, to the real problems that we're having, not just

Speaker 2:          00:11          politically, but in terms of the globe, the planet.

We've gone, I think from some sense of alarmism kind of a chicken little sense of the planet's gonna Cook Up to 190 degrees and we're all gonna die. Um, we've got the evidence just keeps mounting, which, uh, has resulted, I think in a well growing consensus that, uh, that yeah, this is, this is real and it's not, it's not good. Alternatives to war. Um, again, when I was listening to a, a talk earlier today, which talked about lifting a Edm in out of Uganda and placing them somewhere else. And, and, uh, and, uh, without destroying the whole country, I mean a way of ways of neutralizing dictators that are less or that are more humane and less destructive than just an all out war on the country. Uh, I think I'm a leader that would have a more inventive sense of strategies because we need some new paradigm in war is sort of an, it should be. We should be over that, that, that old paradigm of just throwing our youngest people into the face of,
