Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, I think one of the key lessons or reminders is how intertwined main street and Wall Street really is. When we were, uh, working with the federal government, um, during the Aig crisis, one of my biggest concerns and that very rapid collapse of aig was how many companies in this country could have liquidity choked out and they didn't, they, they, it, it was coming too quickly and the implications across the country were profound. And so I think one, recognizing how important it is to, um, have a, a safe yet robust financial system if we hope to have financial growth is a very important, um, uh, reminder. And that in fact, if you don't have a healthy financial system, it's hard to, to fund the growth that small, medium, large companies and individuals need and deserve. So I think, again, it's the relationship between main street and Wall Street is important. Curbing excesses is clearly important and I think putting us on a stable base so we can have that consistent growth in the industry to support capitalism. Otherwise, again, um, we can't have the growth that, that the country needs to do. You can have the growth economy needs.

Speaker 1:          01:37          I'm generally an optimist. I think I've seen so many cycles in my 23 years in the business. I started in August of 1987 only to see the market have one of the biggest crashes ever in October of 87. And seeing a number of other cycles and after each one, lessons or lessons are learned. And I think that the pendulum often swings too far one way before it comes back the other way. But there's a, an important learning and growth opportunity that comes out of, um, each one of these situations. This is clearly more profound than what we've seen in many, many decades. And so one would hope that we're building the right foundation to grow from the space.
