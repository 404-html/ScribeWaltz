Speaker 1:          00:03          I would like to make a distinction in say between age zero to about 15 or 16 years before I was, before I came in touch with a woman called, we called [inaudible] in my secondary school in Kenya. And the time after that, um, before I met sister as is the Islam of my family was not political. So I don't, I do not remember either my father or my mother saying that a society has to be, um, as you know, sharia should be the rule of a, of a country or a society with one exception. In the one year that we were in Saudi Arabia, there was no distinction between a secular sphere and, uh, and, and you know, let's say the film of series a in the form of, of God, these white intertwined in Islam. And in the one year that we were in Saudi Arabia, we lived according to Sharia and the state was run through Islamic law.

Speaker 1:          01:16          So the beheadings, for instance, amputations every Friday, the stonings, that kind of thing that happened. And there was a distinction, um, when atrocities in Somalia were carried out by a secular dictatorships that has, such as Muhammad [inaudible], my mother would denounce, condemn those atrocities. But when atrocities were carried out in the state of Saudi Arabia, thieves who are amputated, people's heads were cut off. That was sharia law. And that was something that the victim deserved because he violated the law of God. But we left that behind us in when we left Saudi Arabia and went into Ethiopia. My life in Ethiopian, in Kenya until my 16th year was I would just see, you know, praying five times a day. It was very, of Islam was there socially and culturally it wasn't a political issue. When I meet in 1985 sisters is a different kind of, Islam is introduced and different meaning also from the one I knew from my family, it was a political Islam.

Speaker 1:          02:27          It was very clear. It was an individual choice. It was about what she referred to as the inner she had struggling to simply to meet the obligations to make sure that you play five times instead of three times or two times. Um, fast, all of the Ramadan days, all 30 of them, not half a day I say used to do or a week in a month or something like that. It's just adhering to the rules every day. The rules that allow that have permitted and trying to abstain from what's Harambe or what is forbidden. This is reinforced within the Somali community because Kenya is a very multicultural place and societies it was not as Somali but in the Somali space they were fingers like this man we call it buffalo song. He will fast for a hundred days and he introduced the same kind of radical political all consuming Islam that divides the world into we and they and the division started within the Islamic community so we were those of us who followed the foods rigidly.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Those other Muslims who are neglectful of the rules were considered to be non Muslims hypocrites. We had all sorts of negative attributes for them and then that they extended to the non Muslims. My grandmother represented what's we generally generally would call traditional nomadic Somali life and the values of that tradition, mainly tribal, very much we oriented clan oriented. She taught me my blood line because that is your, you know, you cannot survive without your bloodline. Um, she taught us all these anecdotes about how to survive in the desert, which animals to fear which animals are not to fear which animals to hunt and eat. Um, she was very superstitious when I got ill or my sister got ill, she had no access or knowledge of modern medicine. So she dealt with the challenges in life with the seasons, with droughts. And then she had superstitious explanations for it.

Speaker 1:          04:54          She was a Muslim, but a very different Muslim than for instance, sees as the sisters Caesar, how Islam was very much diluted with her own cultural, um, traditional superstitions. Um, for instance, she thought it was a good thing to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. Uh, which later at sisters isn't vocal song would say that was a bad thing to do. Um, she could not read the Koran. She had land a few verses by heart. Just enough to pray. But she didn't allow us to put the Qur'an on the ground. She would make us kiss the Qur'an and puts it on her the highest surface and faster cleaner has before we touch the time, anything like that. So she was just more of a traditional Somali nomadic value system. With respect to Islam. We should make a distinction between Muslims and Islam. Muslims as individual human beings like you and me can be influenced. We're not born. It's not a genetic discrepancy to be a Muslim. You are just an individual human being and you can be persuaded to change your mind. And so engage in critical thinking and change the course of your life is alarm. Just like Nazis. Him today is a very violent totalitarian, the dangerous doctrine. And the sooner we see it, the better.

Speaker 1:          06:27          It depends on where they are. If you are in Europe or in America, you'll have access to so much education, so much empirical evidence that you can change your own life if you do certain things. I would say to Muslims living in the West, take advantage, fully advantage of that. Um, develop your mind and your faculties of critical thinking and look around you and why are we here? I'm in Cheyenne answered that question. What I'm millions of Muslims leaving their own home countries and seeking a better life in the west. What is it in the West that they're doing great but we are doing wrong if you are in Muslim countries than there is a difference that a welcome Muslim countries through oil, solely citizens, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and so on who can afford because they don't have to go about it. Didn't have to spend 90% of their time seeking brad like the poor neighborhoods of Egypt.

Speaker 1:          07:27          Uh, that group can make a change and can bring in because we live in the age of Internet and so on. They can't translate progressive books, the Enlightenment Command lots of ideas, books here into Arabic and bring it and give it to their own people. Right now, the only reading the Koran, it's, it's very little to live on intellectually, um, for in poor countries. Um, what you see now is that the Islamic Brotherhood or Brotherhood organizations, fundamentalist Islamic organizations are the ones who are providing the care. And it's an uncorrupted care, health care, you know, food. Making sure that places are safe, neighborhoods are safe and so on. And that's can be challenged by, I would say, people who will not replace one form of oppression with another form of oppression.

Speaker 2:          08:35          Yeah.
