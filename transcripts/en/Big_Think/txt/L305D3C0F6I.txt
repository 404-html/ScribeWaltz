Speaker 1:          00:03          What inspires me

Speaker 1:          00:05          making a difference in the world, leaving a legacy or making a difference, having an impact on the lives of other people and feeling like, Hey, my life has been worthwhile. I did have some modest impact on, on the people I encountered in this world. And uh, and leading a life of integrity, of being true to what I believe in without compromising that in order to get ahead. I look for lessons closest to the people closest to me from my wife who is my partner, if you will. And uh, from other leaders who might have known and worked with. I have a men's group, but I learned a lot from them and a couples group, but we've been together both them for more than 20 years. Uh, and so I certainly learned a lot, uh, and also going back to great books and learning what others have learned over time, but how do we bring that forward into a current day context and watching what other leaders are doing and try to learn from them? No. All my life, I've been interested in leaders in part that was imprinted on me by my father who thought he should have been a leader and never was. And so from a very early age I was reading books on great leaders have, you know, people like Abraham Lincoln, you know, just a wide range of leaders. Everything I could get my hands on is a 79 year old boy.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Teaching takes many forms. I don't know if you want to stay with teaching leadership. Certainly we have people teaching is great things in many, many, many forms. But this is leadership I think has been under appreciated as an area of academic concentration. I think we've been too concentrated on financial management and not enough on helping people become better leaders and creating an environment in which they could throughout their lifetime and teach. Learning them, teaching them how to learn throughout their lifetimes to take on more opportunities and to lead. So there, I think it's been a real vacuum and the teaching of leadership in academic institutions and I think corporations have looked at it too much as socialization to company. No.
