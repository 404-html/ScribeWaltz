Speaker 1:          00:04          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:06          I can think of a couple of people,

Speaker 3:          00:08          mmm.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Who are sort of, um, part of my world, but not exactly,

Speaker 3:          00:17          uh,

Speaker 2:          00:30          interesting question because a couple of those people I already did talk to.

Speaker 3:          00:34          MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:53          I think I'd like to interview this, the Rock Star born Bano I'm interested that he, uh, it still functions as a musician, but has this, uh, idea of this, of turning his global access into some kind of an influential thing fascinates me that he wants to do that.

Speaker 3:          01:17          MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:20          I guess for a very different reason.

Speaker 3:          01:25          MMM.

Speaker 2:          01:28          I'd like to interview my favorite soccer player, Alfredo brazy. It's been retired for about 10 years.
