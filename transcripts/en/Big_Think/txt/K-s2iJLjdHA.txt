Speaker 1:          00:08          No, I wouldn't apply the term journalists to myself. I think we operate with some, a journalistic practices, but by no means what I carry that title.

Speaker 1:          00:24          I think that's a, a terrible question that's often asked by a sort of mainstream media for trying to grasp this. They're not, it's not mutually exclusive. There is journalism that appears on blogs. So I guess that's blogging and journalism. Um, and then there are sites like mine that are journalistic but, uh, you know, aren't sort of hard fast sticking to that definition. And then I think you have random rambling 13 year olds who are printing whatever idea pops in their head. And uh, I think that's just blogging. Um, you know, I think every mainstream publication out there from time to the New York Times is trying to jump on this blogging phenomenon and they are using journalism to fuel that. It just happens to appear online in different forms.
