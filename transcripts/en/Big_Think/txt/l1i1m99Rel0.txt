Speaker 1:          00:09          Relations in the United States today. Marvelously complicated question. Um, there was an article in the Washington Post today about some of Obama's workers being disturbed or more than disturb, horrified by some of the racial responses they'd had when they go ask people to vote for Obama. So race in America is certainly better than it's ever been. I don't believe that racism of unsorted or another is curable. I think it's always something that's there for people who need it to use it. Um, whether it's racism, antisemitism, Annika, fallacy ism and a immigration. There are people for whom that will always give them some kind of sustenance. And, um, I think part of the problem is that we think we can do away with that and we can, and I think also the part of the problem is that we ask ourselves to cure ourselves. I don't think, I think that there are still elements of racism and anyone, anyone, no matter how much they believe they've overcome it, it's still there.

Speaker 1:          01:24          And to make, to try to kid yourself and think that it's not is makes it harder. I think it's important to recognize that human beings tend to think in a, in a binomial way. We think yes or no. We think good or bad. We think black or white, and that's in our minds, that's the structure of our minds and we can, we have to struggle against it, but we can't pretend that it's not there. And I think sometimes we ask people to get to shed that from themselves to, to, to free them from it and people can't. It's there. It's part of our mental structure and I think it's very crucial that people recognize no it, that other people have, that

Speaker 1:          02:21          it's the way our minds are constructed, our mindset. It may have to do with something like computers who the on off through our electrons work the same way in our brain. They're either clicking on or clicking off and we tent. That's the way we work. We think the first thing we think is a, uh, is a yes or no answer, a two sided answer. And then we learned that in fact there are many two sided answers in the middle of those things, that it isn't black or white, that there are graze. It isn't good or bad. There are things in the middle that temper that, but as long as we pretend that we can overcome that, I think it causes us more green.

Speaker 1:          03:11          So long concert, I thought that question, how does one identify? So I think primarily the primary identity is that we're members of the same species and that that that's absolutely crucial to us that our future depends on our realization that we're part of the same species and that everything else is subservient to that. As long as we think of ourselves primarily as American or French or or whatever Iraqi, we're going to continue to divide and continued to find conflict. And I think that the, the, the hope is the great, I've been reading a lot about globalization, not just globalization as commerce, but global globalization as concept of the way human beings had been globalizing ever since history began. Before history, we came out of Africa and spread over the world. That was the first globalization. And I think that the, the, the kind of globalization we have now where there's communication, did intimate communication between everybody in the world might be what's going to save us from our batteries.

Speaker 2:          04:38          Okay.
