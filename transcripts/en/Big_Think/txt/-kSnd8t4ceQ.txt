Speaker 1:          00:10          It doesn't disturb me at all. I'm, I'm always believe in talking to my opponents and stayed friends. I mean, you know it just so the people I disagree with most strongly, I'm actually quite friendly with this. Nope. It doesn't make. It doesn't disturb me if they disagree with me. Well, I don't know. It changes from week to week. What I've noticed is there's been a strong increase in skepticism and just in the last couple of weeks, and I suppose it has something to do with all this snow storms we've been having. I don't know, but certainly I've seen the politicians becoming much more skeptical just recently. That's across. I welcome that. I think that that that's actually means they're recognizing the way things are.

Speaker 1:          01:21          Well, there are all sorts of ways. It was a couple of farmers in Minnesota I was just reading about who decided to change from feed lots to grass. Was there raising beef that there. These are farmers who are just raising cows for beef, add a certain amount of milk as well, and they decided to switch from feed lots, which is of course the fashionable way of raising cows. You keep them on a very crowded feed lot and feed them on call, so you're growing corn to feed to the animals. Instead of that, you put them out to grass, but you manage the grass in a clever way with moving fences around. So they actually eat the grass much more evenly. It turns out this pace and, and uh, it's uh, they're doing extremely well just going back from feed lots to grass and it has a big effect on the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in proportion to the area that they're using.

Speaker 1:          02:36          That means that if the whole of the Middle West would do this, it would make a very substantial difference to the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And so that kind of, that's the sort of practical thing you can do just managing the land more intelligently. And this, it's rather like building dikes around new orleans. I mean, it's, it's not all that spectacular, but it actually works and so changing from feed lots to grass, I think it's sort of, it doesn't solve the whole problem, but it solves a certain chunk of the problem and there are other things you can do. Just doing less plowing makes a huge difference. Plowing is one of the main causes of carbon going into the atmosphere because you expose the soil to the atmosphere at means. The carbon gets oxidized, becomes carbon dioxide and floats off into the atmosphere. So if you can find without plowing, it actually helps and doesn't matter how much coal and oil burning that still helps.
