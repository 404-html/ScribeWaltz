Speaker 1:          00:08          I think our women's program got started a lot sooner and with a lot more seriousness than the rest of the world. I think most, most of the rest of the world doesn't respect women's soccer. Whereas here we're like, that's great. You know, that's awesome. And so we're gonna put the money and resources into it to make them the best team that they can be. And I think we got a good jump on the rest of the world in that fashion because, uh, the rest of the world was like women's soccer, you know, I mean, who's ever. It's all about men's soccer everywhere and that's all everybody cares about. So even now, even though they have women's national teams in place, there's still not that respect that we give our women's national team here, uh, which is, you know, disappointing on a lot of levels for the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          00:52          But for here we give our women's national team the same kind of coverage would give them meds. We give them the same respect. I'm they have some great players and it's cleared out the countries that have started taking it a little more serious in the women's game are starting to be at our women's team and so, you know, there's seems to be, you know, like five or six top teams that uh, the US included that are, uh, you know, kind of just, there's the, is being switched back and forth now and we don't, us doesn't dominate as much. Now there's some trepidation in the US soccer camp that, you know, we might have lost our foothold and uh, the women's soccer a spectrum. So that's good. It's good. Only good for our program. I'm glad to have some fear because they were running the show for, for a number of years.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Absolutely. I think, uh, just a touch about the competition angle. I think once the other teams will say, Germany, Germany's got a very good women's national team. Once they kind of decided, you know, what, we want our German team to win. We don't want USA to win everything. Then they started being like, then the competition comes in and the pride comes in. And so now they've got a great women's national team and it competes with our team in Brazil as well. Uh, just another country that it does some of the same. So, uh, I hope that would, that would generate more respect for the women's game. Uh, I don't see why it wouldn't, but, you know, that being said, it could just be a pride thing and I don't want to lose the United States. And I mean ultimately it's a good thing all the way around, just means more exposure for the women's game. Uh, I have a 10 month old daughter at home named Julia. Uh, and so, uh, I have a much different appreciation for women's sports and I probably would have otherwise because, you know, I want her to at least have that as an option if that's something she wanted to.
