Speaker 1:          00:13          I would love someone else when they see it and not only say it's beautiful, but hopefully to say that the experience went beyond that. I mean, because beauty in the art world particularly let's say in the, in the kind of academic world is, is a dismissive term, which, uh, essentially would mean a decorative. And I say to students, I say, well, I hate to tell you guys, but you could make it as rigorous as you want. You can make it as theoretical as you want,

Speaker 2:          00:55          but

Speaker 1:          00:57          don't make it that hermetic. Let other people in, you know, remember, who are you talking to? You just want to talk to yourself. You want to talk to a few art professionals or as Barnett Newman said, do you want to hit the ball out of the field? I think that's really important. I think that is a really important part of being an artist. You know, I always had a sense of who I was talking to in my work, who my audience was. It was always very limited. It's the voices in our head. We all have voices in our head and that's what I mean by the kind of, uh, the weight of consciousness, who those voices are, how they change over the years. They change sometimes in my head, those voices a matter of fact, most of the time, unfortunately those voices are very harsh. They say render really,

Speaker 2:          02:02          um,

Speaker 1:          02:07          very astringent criticism. Know which any artist will tell you that they're there. They're their own worst critic. I don't have to read criticism to know everything that's wrong with my work. Does not, never a critic who said something bad about my work that I didn't disagree, that I disagreed with because I knew when I read it that I could do it better. As a matter of fact, when I've read good things, it kind of upsets me. I don't know why. It's just the way I am. When you're talking to students, you tell them, you know, when the end, you can do whatever you want, but, but don't let these terms and don't let the, the, the, the academic part of being an artist, the kind of graduate mentality, the graduate school, uh, oppress you because that's exactly why you became an artist. You know, it's kind of a peeling back of layers. It's, it's hopefully a path to some kind of, some kind of liberation,

Speaker 3:          03:17          uh,

Speaker 1:          03:18          some kind of map of how you could find your way out of the, what I consider the unnecessary suffering that goes on in a lot of our minds all the time.
