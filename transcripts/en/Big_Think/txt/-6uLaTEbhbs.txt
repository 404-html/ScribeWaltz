Speaker 1:          00:09          I changed the world everyday. I am an agent of change, uh, and hopefully positive change and that's the way I view my work. Uh, when I say I changed the world every day, well, how do we try to ensure that no child in America goes to sleep at night, worried that they don't have healthcare coverage, uh, and cannot get ill. Uh, how do we ensure that every kids, God given potential is fulfilled? How do we use the power of our collective intellect as a more powerful tool than the power of our bombs? And how do we do it in a way that promotes democracy and human rights across the world? Um, and how do we take American ingenuity and turn it for good in other parts in the world? So, uh, what I get to do is work out everyday at changing the world, being part of changing the course of events, of being able to make the wind that blows over our people, blow a lot more gently. Uh, and at the end of the day, I'm moving in a direction that, uh, says to me personally that I have left the world a better off today than it was yesterday.

Speaker 1:          01:45          Well, change isn't always easy and it doesn't always happen. And sometimes I wonder, did I leave the world better off today than it was yesterday? Uh, but, uh, but bringing people together in common cause is a great challenge. Also great opportunity to do great things. Um, and obviously that's a, that's a struggle because we don't all come from the same experiences, come from the same backgrounds, look at everything the same way even when sometimes we believe in a common goal, but we have different views as to how we achieve them. And so, uh, that's a struggle. It's a struggle from someone who grew up poor, uh, to be in an institution which getting there often, uh, requires, uh, for example, raising money, uh, to, uh, expanding very expensive elections in media markets that are very expensive so that you can get your message so that of what you want to do so that you can be elected to then do the things that will change the course of events. And, and that's, that's a struggle. Hi. I think I'm best known for,

Speaker 2:          03:09          um,

Speaker 1:          03:11          trying to give Hispanic Americans a place at the table, particularly as it relates to a,

Speaker 2:          03:19          um,

Speaker 1:          03:21          being part of the political space in our country. Uh, empowering seeking to empower Latino's, which I've done from my home state of New Jersey, had been involved with nationally, uh, and also riveting attention, uh, within the fastest part of America's population growth and the largest single minority that there is a great potential, not just for that community itself, but for the broader American community. Um, this is a community that is a younger by a decade and the rest of the population, uh, and so as the nation grays and grows older, it will increasingly look to members of this community within the American family for the quality of their lives. Some of us will be washing a surgeons, I mean a, a kitchen knife in a, uh, in a restaurant. And another one of us will be holding a surgeon's knife in an operating room and how well educated and trained that individual will be will be increasingly important to those who are going to be his or her patients.

Speaker 1:          04:27          And so if we are younger by a decade, uh, and uh, going to be about 25 percent of all of the nations schoolchildren within the next 20 years, it means the educational future of the nation is also at stake in large part to this community. Uh, and so how well educated that a part of American society is going to be important for the nations competitive future. So having Hispanic Americans play a significant role in having policy issues that affect the quality of their lives, that in return, therefore, the quality of opportunity in America is something that I think that not only have I been doing, but that I am known for in terms of part of my work. It would be that, uh,

Speaker 1:          05:20          it is a sleeping giant that I think is about to awaken and needs to wake up and needs to wake up by using its electoral power in a way that can decide the course of events, uh, immediately in our country. And for the longterm, I think the community has a transformational opportunity to change and impact not only, for example, who the next president of the United States will be, which in and of itself will be significant. But where public policy will head when you have 17 million Latinos in the country, uh, who are eligible to vote. And when you see where they're located in the states that are critical for an electoral victory, for the next president of the United States, you have an opportunity, uh, to have a transformational change by the use of your power, our challenge, my message to the community that would be, you've got to use that power because that power ultimately comes back in the things that you care about, for the future of your family, for the future of the community that you live in, the nation that you call your own Giotto, Latina decade, a dealing room, bullet in life, Doria that allow both the full tool, that device in a bladed that acc at the median is the baton.

Speaker 1:          07:04          This gang, the moment to voiding the city kimball, Proximo, presidente battle, the Wallace sloppily, Deca, Domestica, internacional. They get pulled a muscle or rather lacking, get to the.

Speaker 1:          07:21          And I want to maintain a point instead of the city though for the looser than northrop audit, Elo Unico embedding to it, but is to trump material and acquire good parents like the name of etc. It a solid support that focus you have, someone has supported, considered below hit have club, but a proximal president for them, but he wound up political domestica do this, evaporated fairly sudden news, very different in the house of representatives and institution of 435 people that is incredibly diverse. Uh, gettIng uh, enough people in common cause 218 people to pass anything is a real challenge. But particularly, uh, one of the big differences between the house and the senate as if you're in the house of representatives and if you happen to be in the minority party, whenever that might be, whether it's republicans or democrats in the past, it's almost an abject minority because the rules of the house control the process in such a way that the majority largely controls everything primarily through a traffic cop call that rules committee.

Speaker 1:          08:54          And in doing so, that committee, which is a super majority of the majority of controls, what gets to the floor of the house of representatives under what way? It's debated how much time, what amendments and all that. So, and, and it can even change the legislation that you may have gotten out of another committee that, uh, ultimately comes before the rules committee. The rules committee can say, you know what, we're going to rewrite this bill and we're going to send it to the floor in a different way. so in the house of representatives, not only is getting common cause and much more difficult challenge because you knew 218 votes, but you also have the differences between a majority and a minority with the minority facing enormous hurdles to have its views or propositions be voted on in the United States senate. Not only of course is that a smaller institution, 100 members, but the power is given to an individual senator can make a minority senator, uh, one in which they play a majority role.

Speaker 1:          09:57          Uh, and because there is no traffic cop, the rules committee and so much moves in the senate by what we call unanimous consent, which just means that there has to be unanimity among 100 members to let something move forward. And one senator can get up and object. And I had an early experience of that upon coming to the senate where there was a legislation in the final days of the republican senate in 2006 that wanted to change and authorize a Ryan White funding, which is important about aids prevention and, uh, uh, and the, how we help the hiv affected community. And it was going to be done in such a way that clearly would have hurt my state of New Jersey, uh, in ways that I could not tolerate on behalf of that community. And it was my power then as a minor part of the minority power party.

Speaker 1:          10:49          But as an individual senator to say I object and by my objections stopping a process that until a negotiation took place with me that changed the course of events at made that legislation in its reauthorization far more acceptable to those people who have suffered with hiv aids in my home state of New Jersey. And it's an example of how even a, a member of the minority party in the senate can have a disproportionate opportunity to affect the course of events than a minority member of the house. Of representatives, maybe not as many as I'd like since it is one of those books that inspire me. Uh, but there are moments, there are moments. I think there are moments, people who are the party of the president and are willing to buck the president. Uh, and that is, I think a, a, a profile encouraged. There are those people who are willing to speak out against a, what might be seen as the popular view in a country or among their colleagues.

Speaker 1:          12:09          And I know last year I know I was only one of 12 members, uh, to vote to transition out of Iraq, uh, out of 100 member body and, uh, you know, um, for a lot of, uh, uh, those individuals, uh, that was not an easy choice, but they felt it was the right choice. Um, and so there are moments of that, you know, um, uh, uh, I think though that, um, to say what is one person's profile encourage, uh, may not be seen as significant as another's. But, uh, um, I think passage from profiles and courage that speaks to this is a, in a prologue which says, in whatever arena of life what meets the challenge of courage, no matter the sacrifices they face, if they follow their conscience, the loss of their friends, their fortune, their contentment, even the esteem of their fellow man, each person must decide for themselves the course they will follow, the stories of past courage they can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration, but they cannot provide courage itself for this. Each person must look into their own soul. And I think there are members of the senate in their own ways on different issues who, uh, from time to time look into their own soul and act in a way that is courageous.
