Speaker 1:          00:11          Well, certainly I think religious forces have had a huge impact and continue to, whether it's, um, whether it's a particular religion or a profit or whatever. Um, certainly we wouldn't, we wouldn't be here in the United States if, um, our forefathers hadn't been concerned about religious persecution in Europe at the time. They, uh, the pilgrims came over to Plymouth rock. Um, we wouldn't see the same divisions if we hadn't had the crusades. I mean, that's, that's been something that has influenced us through the centuries, I believe it is to make things better, to try and make the world a better place for the people who live here.
