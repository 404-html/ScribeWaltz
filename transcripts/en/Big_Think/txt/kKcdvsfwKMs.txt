Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Kept trying to get this interview. So what could the second blank dollars to, how many houses can you you use private? How many jumps can you own? So give the, give the rest of it away. But if I were giving money away, I would probably give it mostly to direct service providers as people actually, or they're actually doing research say for giving me cancer research for AIDS research. The actual researchers and the people actually providing on the ground services to peel because there's plenty of think tanks. There's plenty of things that get a lot of money to turn a lot of position papers and some of them are usable position papers. Board tend to be underfunded by private donors today or people give him the services on the ground. Little things that aren't sexy. Soup Kitchens, food closets, things like that. Those are desperately under funded by private donors or give to the big issues that get something named after yourself and so on.

Speaker 2:          00:58          I think if money mainly to causes like that and something else, I think I might give away money to establish writing programs, um, writing programs, especially in the inner city, but elsewhere as well in rural areas, places where a lot of times, or it can certainly go to school, they don't get the individual encouragement to think about the possible you may have the talent to be a writer. Let's try it out and, and see you saying that people tend to ride a lot. 10 of people think a lot and we need more. People will think a lot and I'd like to encourage that.
