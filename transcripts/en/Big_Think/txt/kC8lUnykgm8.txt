Speaker 1:          00:07          Oh, I don't think judges at our level, I don't think much about public, I think the Supreme Court does because you know, it's interesting example of a couple of years ago, they, the court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is California number. Then western states decided that the phrase under God in the pledge of allegiance was unconstitutional and that caused a certain sensation. But on the other hand, it was just the ninth circuit. It was just the West in any way. It was subject to appeal the Supreme Court. Will, the supreme court found a technical ground for reversing the decision they didn't deal with. The issues of religious freedom that are involved was very technical. Now, if the Supreme Court decided under God in the pledge of allegiance was unconstitutional, that would have a tremendous impact. Uh, and I, I think the supreme court justice is consciously or unconsciously are mindful of the public opinion consequences of their decision.

Speaker 1:          01:18          But at our level, our decisions, we rarely have significant effect on public opinion. So the response to the public is not, is not a factor, but on the other hand, there's no doubt that judges idea ideological views and political responses and moral feelings and so on are influenced by the, uh, the temper of the, of the community. So some of us think, well, we mean by morality is durable public opinion, right? So the judges will share the morality of their community, which is ultimately a product of what people feel. So, so public opinion has a tremendous underground effect. The courts are all more conservative, for example, than they were in the sixties. So there's been an ideological drift in the country and equivalently has been a change in public opinion that's affected who's been appointed as a judge but also affected how. How'd you.
