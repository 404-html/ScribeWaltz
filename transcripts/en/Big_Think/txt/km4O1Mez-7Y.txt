Speaker 1:          00:08          The James Beard Foundation is a group of food professionals who really want to, um, foster the community of cooking and food and fine cuisine and to help young students more than anything else, get into culinary school and learned the joys of cooking and, and hopefully make it a profession. Um, so that's kind of what it is at it, at its core. It's become a very important group in the food industry because it, it annoyance chefs and restaurants around the country. Um, and every year it gives awards to the best chefs both regionally and then, um, nationwide as well as restaurants and wine service. So it's always been a very good barometer of, of rising stars and who are kind of the top of their game.
