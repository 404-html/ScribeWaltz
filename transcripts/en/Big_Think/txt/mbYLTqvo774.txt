Speaker 1:          00:00          Physics is about discovering with the laws of nature are, and we've gotten some distance towards that. We're not done, but we've gotten some good distance towards that at the present time. But once you know it, the laws of nature are another kind of question unfolds itself, which is why are those the laws and not other laws. For example, the laws that we understand, the standard model of particle physics describes all the fundamental particles. They're interactions has about 30 numbers, which you just have to put in as the result of measuring them by experiment, the masses of a different particles, the quarks, electrons, neutrinos the strengths of the fundamental forces, various numbers like that. And the model works dramatically well as the recent experiments at the large Hadron collider show, why are those numbers, what they are and our universe, why is a massive the electron, what it is and not 12 times larger, half the size.

Speaker 1:          00:53          There are dozens of questions like this. So I developed cosmological natural selection to try to give an evolutionary account of this so that there would be a history back before the big bang. And we see these numbers could change and evolve through a series of events like the Big Bang and there could be an explanation akin to natural selection. Just like you want to know why do people have two legs and not three legs or five legs or four legs or six legs. There's an evolutionary reason for that. A certain kind of fitness has been improved over many, many generations and similarly that could be a notion of fitness of the laws of nature should approve or many generations and cosmological natural selection was an example of the theory of that kind. I realized that the only methodology we hadn't science or the best methodology, we had science for explaining how choices having made the system true lead to a lot of structure because one of the mysteries is why our universe is so structured as it is on so many scales from organic molecules.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Bio Molecules are too vast. Arrays of clusters of galaxies. This enormous structure on such a wide range of scales and that turns out to be tied to the values of these constants of the Standard Model of particle physics. And so why is that? And I realized that the only methodology that was really successful for explaining how choice were made in nature such as to lead to an improbable amount of structure is natural selection. So for natural selection, we need reproduction. And it was a hypothesis lying around that universities reproduced through black holes inside black holes, rather than there being singularities we're time ends. There were the, basically the bursts of new regions of space and time, which could become new universes. And I took over that hypothesis and took over the hypothesis that maybe the laws of nature changed slightly, which has been made by Johnny Wheeler in the 1960s and just added a little bit, which is that those changes should be very small, that there can be accumulation of fitness leads to a prediction or an observation that archer, many, many generations, the population of universities should be fine tuned to maximize the production of black holes.

Speaker 1:          03:14          And that has further implications for things that we can actually try to measure and disprove experimentally. So that's very briefly the idea of cosmological natural selection.

Speaker 2:          03:28          Okay.
