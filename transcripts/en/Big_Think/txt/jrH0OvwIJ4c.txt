Speaker 1:          00:10          Well, I, I think religious communities are extremely important as ways of reinforcing individuals, commitments and identities and that will, that continues to be the case and, and will continue to be the case, uh, whether there is a rising tide of secularism as some argue or a rising tide of a resurgence of religion worldwide, as, as others argue, I think depends very much on which country we look at. I think if we look at the broader sweep of human history, then the, it's clear the outlier is Europe and America in so far as it had western Europe from the enlightenment on and the United States in so far as it is followed that pattern and it was only in perfectly and perfectly followed it for the rest of human history. Religion has always been a dimension of people's finding, their identity and, and the affirming values and I think into a significant degree that is again, happening worldwide.

Speaker 1:          01:16          Now. The most visible form of it is Islam in which it's clear Islam is playing a major geopolitical role that it hasn't for, for some centuries, but it's not only Islam, it's also clear that religious, a resurgence a is evident in other communities as well. Uh, I personally am A. I'm a Christian who is, who's Christian identity is, would be disputed by a great many Christians. Uh, and I guess I could tell you a story about that. In, in 1969, 1970, I spent a year in Sri Lanka studying Buddhism and my Buddhist conversation partners, uh, we're convinced that, that what defined a Christian was that a Christian believed in God is a being outside the world who created the world, number one. And number two, that a Christian believed in that every individual what had an immortal soul. And when I told him that I didn't believe either of those propositions, but considered myself a Christian, they said, well, that's impossible. You can't be a Christian unless you believe in a god outside the world who created the world in an immortal soul. Uh, now many Christians would agree those are very important for defining Christianity. So my kind of Buddhist Christianity or Buddhist influence Christianity is, is, uh, an, an od, a combination of affirmations, but one in which I feel quite comfortable and in which both some Christians and some Buddhists would consider me suspect.
