Speaker 1:          00:11          Look at the stars, top 10% performers versus people who are just mediocre. Just at the average. Uh, there's a way to do a systematic analysis of the capabilities or competencies that stars have that you don't find that the average David Mcclellan, it was one of the developers of this. Really, my work in emotional intelligence looks at that because it turns out, particularly for leadership, most of the competencies that distinguish outstanding leaders have nothing to do with Iq, with academic intelligence. They're in this other domain, uh, whether people are getting more competitive or not a more viciously competitive, I think people have always been viciously competitive. However, people who are the most effective, uh, tend to be competitive in a different way. They compete with themselves. They have, as I said, they have very high standards for performance and they're continually trying to understand how to learn to do better. And that's the more effective way to compete, improve your own performance, not run against the other guy necessarily.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Here's the problem with Malcolm's book. You know, he talks about cohorts that have been privileged by accident, by experience, but one of them, for example, is a, as I remember, Jewish lawyers who were born in the 1930s and some of them were spectacularly successful. The problem is he didn't take a sample of all Jewish lawyers born in thirties there are also certain to be failures among them, and his model doesn't really explain what distinguishes the failures from the outliers, which, so it's a good beginning, but you know, I was waiting for the other shoe to drop and then the book ended. But Malcolm is a wonderful writer. I really don't know.
