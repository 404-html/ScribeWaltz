Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:13          you know, it's like, um, we're living in the, in the first days of, of mass self organization. Um, you know, clay shirky likes to say this is as big a change is the admission of the printing press was 500 years ago. We now have ridiculously easy tools for organizing ourselves. And so the political impact is huge. The, the, the presidential election just is like a huge training ground. So there were thousands of thousands of people who have just gone through an experience of effectively discovering how good they can be as organizers, right? They've learned how to a survey, their own local political landscape and figure out how to deliver the votes that were needed for the larger cause. In this case of electing Obama, many of these people aren't going to, they're not going back to what they were before this, you know, the Obama campaign surveyed a, their supporters after the election, they got about half a million actually filled out a detailed survey and 10 percent, 50,000 people said they're interested in running for office, which means a whole new wave of, of energy entering the political process at every level. And whenever that happens, um, you're, you're bound to have a change in as well in what the incumbents do and as these people get elected and then rise and, you know, start running for higher office, it has a larger societal effect. So I think, you know, you might call this the Obamas coattails and he is just the beginning of that much bigger wave that's going to spread through American society. Assuming that we don't have a political disaster. I mean, I'm assuming he, he lives up to the promises that.
