Speaker 1:          00:00          In the good old times, people learned how to read and to write. That's no longer sufficient in the high tech 21st century. We also need to know how to deal with risk and uncertainty and that is what I mean with risk savvy. Here's a simple example. You hear on the where's the report could there's a 30% chance of rain tomorrow, 30% chains of what now? I live in Berlin and most Belinda's believe that it means that it will rain in 30% of the time. That is seven to eight hours as a think. It will rain in 30% of the region. Most New Yorkers belief, that's all nonsense. It means it will rain on 30% of the days for rich. This prediction has been made that is most likely not at all. Many psychologists think that people can't learn how to deal with risk, but in this case it's the experts do meteorologists.

Speaker 1:          01:16          We have not learned how to communicate risk in an understandable way. That is to say to what class? The 30% refers time or region or days. And if you have some imagination you can think of what other classes. For instance, one woman in New York said, I know what 30% means, three meteorologist think it rains and seven not now getting soaked isn't minor risk, but I'll be risk savvy when it comes to more important things. For instance, 20 year olds drive, we still cell phone glued to their ears not realizing that the decrees, their reaction time to that of a 70 year old or many Americans, about 20% believe that they are in the top 1% income group and as many believed it will be soon be there or take health. So about an estimated 1 million children get every year unnecessary computed tomography. CT scans unnecessary because they're not really clinically indicated, which is not just a waste of time but also danger to the kids because a ct scan can have the radiation of a hundred chest x rays and may lead in a small number of these kids later to cancer.

Speaker 1:          02:51          We deal everyday with risks but we haven't learned how to understand them. And the problem is not simple in the human mind, but also in experts who is a, don't know what the risks are or don't know how to communicate them or in other areas, like if it's about finance or health, have interests other than yours. So the key message you stays, everyone can learn to deal with risks. In that case, everyone can learn to ask the question, probability of what. And second, if you believe that are safe by young delegating the responsibility of your Wilson and health to experts, then you may be disappointed because many experts do not know how to communicate probabilities or, uh, tried to protect themselves against you as in health care as a potential plaintiff. So you have to think yourself. And that's the key message.
