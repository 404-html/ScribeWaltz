Speaker 1:          00:08          I smiled because I'm probably the only one running for president who took an issue to the democratic platform personally and ask them to act on it. And let me tell you what the issue was. Healthcare in 2000 I took this proposal for a not for profit healthcare system, medicare for ah, to the Democratic Platform Committee. I was asked by the campaign, the presidential candidate to withdraw the proposal because it was, it was not favored by the insurance interest who were contributing mightily to the Democratic Party. And, and virtually the same thing happened in 2004 so here's the Democratic Party. These candidates are saying universal healthcare, like it's some kind of mantra, universal healthcare, universal healthcare. And then people go, oh, they're for me. They're going to give me a universal healthcare. The insurance companies want universal healthcare as long as the government is subsidizing them so they can maintain theirs. They're holding their privilege profit position. I'm talking about no more healthcare for profit. Everyone knows these insurance companies make money not providing health care. Everyone knows it. So I'm saying no more for profit healthcare, not for profit system. All the money goes into care for people. And then you have enough money, not only for basic care but for vision care, dental care, mental health care, longterm care, prescription drugs, all covered 100% under the cassette, which program the Democrats new. They want to protect the insurance company.

Speaker 1:          01:48          I don't know that, uh, that I accept much of the platform of either party, but I will tell you this, that I work with Republicans in Congress who stands for protecting the constitution were absolutely opposed to the Patriot Act who believe that wire tapping eavesdropping is an undermining of constitutional protections to be free from your person for unreasonable search searches and seizures who believe that, um, uh, that, that government functions best when it stays out of people private lives. So that aspect, which seems to go more towards, you know, what Republicans think, the things that, that I support. And I, and I also think that, uh, that this idea of, of, of Democrats and Republicans a good idea as long as there's a real debate, but when the debate becomes blurred because you have corporate interest contributing two Democrats and two Republicans, then you have the American people being deserved than people in those parties maintained their privileged position. Well, the economic status of their constituents begins to erode.
