Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, the gap that the celebrity feels is that the celebrity can reach millions of people like that. So the fact that they land a voice, so they need to Africa, it makes millions of people that wouldn't even care about Africa. Look towards what's going on in Africa. I think, you know, there's, um, I think a celebrity prep period during any form of charity is a great thing because a celebrity don't really have to do anything as much as you want to think they do. They're celebrities. So they could actually just chill and don't do nothing. But the thing is, but then there's those celebrities that don't own the land. They name, they act on it. Um, and of course the bar is rose so high for these celebrities. People like Angelina Jolie. Um, she's, she been to Haiti with me, Brad Pitt. I mean, look what Brad's doing at New Orleans. You know what I'm saying? Real initiatives. George Clooney, like going to these places, looking with their eyes and, and, and learning. And then I'm bringing the information back to the American people. I think that's where the future is headed.
