Speaker 1:          00:06          Peaceful rise, that is to say China's goal is to work out the enormous internal contradictions of the country, the growth, tremendous growth of wealth in urban areas, tremendous impoverishment and immobility and rural areas and the fear of the political explosion that could cause China's goal was to work that stuff out in a quiet setting as possible. They don't want to cause international upset. They don't want to get into public fights with the United States or anybody else for that matter. Nevertheless, their political values are profoundly different from ours. I don't think we can have much expectation of China changing China's internal political culture. What I think is a really complicated challenge though, is that China, much more than Russia, has a kind of exportable model. That is to say they too have something to promote, but it's not democracy. It's it's capitalist, it's autocratic capitalism. Russia doesn't feel that way because it doesn't seem to have a system.

Speaker 1:          01:04          Where they have is a lot of oil which just keeps their coffers refilled. China has no such an inherent advantage. China has figured out a means of economic and social and political organization whereby they can be an incredible economic dynamo, but keep a lid on politically. Now, this is of course a tremendously appealing model. If you're an autocrat in some impoverished third world country and China goes around the world, especially to resource rich countries and and offers to kind of deal, you allow us to have a lock on your oil, a certain amount of your oil, so we have a guaranteed amount at a guaranteed price. We in turn will give you concessional loans and grants. You in turn will use those funds, turn around and pay Chinese construction and engineering companies to build your infrastructure. It's a great deal from the point of view of the recipient countries. The only problem is that it cements in place these authoritarian political structures, and so that's a problem for the west, not just for the United States, for other donors, for institutions like the World Bank and the IMF. How do we come up with a sufficiently appealing,

Speaker 2:          02:15          countable, and that's an ongoing problem.
