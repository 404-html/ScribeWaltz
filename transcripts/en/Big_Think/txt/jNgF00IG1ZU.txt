Speaker 1:          00:09          Well in many of the animal groups that we're looking at, you, I mentioned aunts and that was sort of special genetics of closeness, so we can exclude them for now. But even when we look at selfish organisms like the fixed, you know, they're all locusts, they've evolved to lift with an incredibly large troops and incredibly large societies. Now we humans happened, you know, with food into these large cities. No, but that's not actually how we evolved. And so we don't have sort of specific rules to optimize our situation here. And further more, you know, I'm mode of communication, verbal communication and written communication is Israel to be slow compared to the sort of the mass media and the all of the information that we have now. So there's some sort of fascinating, uh, challenges from a biological perspective to the, to our societies. Um, but what we do find is that people are good at learning how to behave in crates.

Speaker 1:          00:59          For example, if you were to take people from, I don't know, the central of America who've never been to a large city and pop them in the middle of Manhattan, and alternately would this be a sort of cultural shock, we would actually be difficult for them to behave within these crates. These are sort of learnt behaviors that you sort of try things out and you eventually kind of optimize how to behave within these environments. And when we film and we track people within crites, what sort of astonishes me is high predictable from a statistical perspective, how predictable crowds are. And so each individual, we can't necessarily predict whether you're going to go left or right, but when we start getting large groups of individuals, we can predict properties like how many lanes will form or you know, what certain times a day, who, who will generally tend to move where. Um, and we can also make predictions about congestion in these environments and so forth.
