Speaker 1:          00:05          Yeah, so a big question, uh, if, if anybody's seen the movie minority report where people are arrested for crimes before they actually commit them, just because the data suggests they're going to commit a crime. Uh, are we entering this world with so much data available? Uh, and are definitely our clues on the Internet that people are considering committing a crime. I mean, people really do tie how to kill your girlfriend on Google or a how to commit a murder. Uh, and uh, so what should we do with this information as a society? I think we have to be really, really careful. Uh, there's uh, an ethical and privacy reasons to be careful as a society. It's not supposed to be illegal to have bad thoughts, uh, but I think there's also a data science reason for this. One of the things that you do see in this data is that a lot of people have horrific thoughts or make horrific searches without ever going through with a horrific action.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Uh, so it may be that when we have all this data, we think we're going to be able to figure out like exactly who's at risk of committing a crime or doing something bad, but it may be that it's just really, really hard because a huge percentage of people look really, really bad on paper, uh, but never go through with the action. There's a study of prosper, a peer to peer lending, uh, from, uh, so people can apply for loans and scholars analyzed the loan application, what people wrote in their loan application and whether they paid back their loan and they found that you could predict whether someone will pay back the loan based on the words that person used in their loan application. So if a person uses the phrase, I promise they're are much less likely to pay back a loan because I guess everybody lies.

Speaker 1:          01:51          So I promise is a, is a clue that you're not going to pay back the loan. And one of them, one of the more striking indicators, one of the single highest indicators you're not going to pay back a loan is if you use the word God in your loan application, uh, and this is kind of a little bit eerie and suggest a potentially dark future. It means that someone, a lender would be wise to not give a loan to anybody who mentions God. If someone says, God bless you, uh, in a loan application, they are put together in a large group of other people who tend on average not to pay back their loans. So there's real danger to some of this big data where a lot of the correlation, everything kind of correlates with everything else. And sometimes for reasons that we have, don't understand some words people use or likes they have on facebook, predict that they're going to do bad things even if they're not really going to do bad things.

Speaker 1:          02:44          And they may be punished without even realizing why. Uh, one thing you see in the Google search data related to religion is the questions people have and they're usually concentrated in the Bible belt. Uh, but people have kind of loaded about God. So why does God allow bad things to happen to good people are, why does God allow suffering? Or why does God needs so much praise? Uh, these are questions that people might not raise a loud because, uh, you know, they don't want to share their doubts with others, but they turn to Google and ask them really, really loaded questions about the stories that they hear a related to religion.
