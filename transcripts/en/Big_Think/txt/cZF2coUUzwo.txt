Speaker 1:          00:06          The 21st century is being shaped

Speaker 2:          00:10          by heavily by technology. In fact, technology has always has always been very powerful, powerful forces in history because it sets the context and information and communications. Technology definitely shape our year or they connect people, they make ideas and information more transparent and open. They can topple regimes. I fully believe that communism ended in eastern Europe because people became aware that they had choices and we're no longer ready to settle for the local option and therefore support those regimes. So technology can have very, very powerful social impact, political impact, and set the context for everything we do.

Speaker 1:          00:59          I don't know

Speaker 2:          01:01          whether people, humanity has an overarching purpose or direction, but I do know that we connect with one another and that are legacies lie in what people remember us for later. I think we feel alive because we're alive in the minds of other people and therefore that might drive us not toward the selfish side or the reptilian parts of our brain fight or flight and defensive reactions. But I think that idea that our identity comes from being known to being cared about by other people. Should drive us to attempt to make more people aware that we have something great to give to them. So part of my personal philosophy I get, so part of my personal philosophy also, I guess, is that giving helps you receive. And that's what I believe our purpose is. I don't know about where that stands theologically, but I believe that we are in charge of our lives on earth and, and also that we have to play the hands we're dealt. I can't turn myself into some totally different kind of person, so I have to use what I have and if it can resonate with other people, then my identity is strengthened and enhanced and they will remember me afterwards wherever I go. Then.
