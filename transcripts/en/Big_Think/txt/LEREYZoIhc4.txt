Speaker 1:          00:14          They're waiting to be explored. My favorite things, I'm very. They aren't really favorite themes. They sort of compulsive themes. Last year I think obviously a lot about global warming. Anybody who thinks thinks about global warming. Um, last year I found that every poem that I started to write turned out to be a pound for garb about global warming and that was not a healthy situation. I realized I could only write about that, so I had to forcibly move myself away from that theme back to other themes. Each poem has an essence of colonel, every work of art as Peter Brook, the Great Theater director pointed that out, that you can reduce any work of art to one kernel of force of colon inspiration. And if every poem is trying to use that same kernel, then you're going to become repetitive and become dull.
