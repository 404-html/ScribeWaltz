Speaker 1:          00:08          The word theory can be used to mean something speculative and tentative in everyday speech. It probably usually is used in that sense, so I'll just very often use it in a much more positive sense. I think the easiest ways to use the ordinary language word fact in the ordinary language sense of the word fact evolution is a fact. The evidence that makes it a fat is partly fossil evidence, uh, partly competitive comparative evidence, looking at modern species and comparing their bones, their organs, their structures generally and especially their molecules that genes at a molecular level. This is extremely persuasive and powerful evidence. You compare the, the genes of animals and plants. You find that they, the pattern of resemblance is a tree of branching tree, and that branching tree could only be a family tree. Other very persuasive evidence is there. The geographical distribution of animals and plants on islands and continents. They are exactly where we should expect them to be. If evolution were a factor.
