Speaker 1:          00:02          So one explanation that people have performed over the years for the spooky connections and for quantum mechanics actually in general, is that it's an indication we live in a multiverse and other words that there are other domains of gals out there that we have only very dim glimpse of quantum mechanics says that when I measure particle, I get a random result and doesn't have any explanation for that random result. So if I flip a quantum coin, it comes up heads or tails and I see heads. Now the strange thing is the mathematics says I should see heads and tails. So it's always been a mystery of why I see one or the other. The proposition is that actually that the coin does come up, heads entails, but it comes up. Heads in our universe entails another universe. So the idea of different universes of parallel universes is a way to make sense of the multiplicity of outcomes or observed in quantum mechanics.

Speaker 1:          01:03          And people have proposed, this would be a way to actually kind of get rid of the non locality that the nonlocality the spooky action at a distance is actually our kind of imperfect glimpse of a, a multiverse of parallel universes and that individually those universes all behave completely locally, no spooky action and I kind of actually have a lot of sympathy for that position. Actually is kind of awesome to think that might be parallel universes not just out there but actually in here that we can be kind of just cheek by jowl with parallel universes all the time. And we'd never even sent them that eve. Any measurement we make what caused the University of branch parallel universes to just be conjured up all the time. And it's kind of an amazing kind of conception of nature. But I've kind of gone off the idea as much as I kind of.

Speaker 1:          01:49          I'm drawn to it initially. And the the reason is that I think that when you see these spooky actions and locality in a broader context, for instance, in the context of other places where they occur in nature, not just for the particles, but they also assumed to occur for black holes that seemed to happen in cosmology, they seem to happen in the workings of gravity. There's a variety of contexts in which you see spooky actions and those other contexts are harder to explain in this kind of parallel universe scenario, but what they really seem to point to is that space and time are derivative. The real message of the spooky action is is that space and time are not fundamental. Particles are rooted in that deeper layer where space and time don't yet exist, and that's the way to explain them. So the building blocks of the world may not be tiny things. What could these building blocks be if they're not tiny? Because that's kind of what we think of as a building block of Lego is smaller than the thing you built out of the Legos. They may be in what seems to us enormous things. Things that spent the entire universe and they're somehow acting in concert with one another to produce these, these phenomena of space.
