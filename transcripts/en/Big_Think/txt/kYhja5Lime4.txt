Speaker 1:          00:10          I think what, what we have done at the college board, if I could explain just a minute about what the college board is, because people somewhat kind of confused about what we are, what we, what we are is first is that we're an organization that is preparing kids to go to college. We have this, we have standards of what you need to doubt to go to college and be successful. We have curriculum from the sixth grade to the 12th grade and math and English. We have the AP program, which is 37 subjects. So we have a standard, we have standards and we have, uh, programs that allow that. We prepare kids to go to college. So we used to be just a, uh, individual programs. Now we're a system of programs that we can prove that we can really improve performance significantly and either a state or school district or in school.

Speaker 1:          01:03          So that's, that's part of what we do. The other, the second part is how do you, how do you, how do you affected the admissions process? So, not only do we provide the sat to colleges and schools and students, but we also do a lot on financial aid. We do a lot of admissions. Part of that's training center that's programs to help administered. And the third thing is we have a program of, of uh, of innovation in research. That's the newest part of the college board began about three years ago. We do studies on, on how you can improve community colleges, how you can employ, prove writing, how you can improve the process of getting more students prepared and ready to go to college. So that those are the three parts of the, of the College Board. And I think that in Time magazine says what they did. It shows that we're trying to make an impact, a substantial impact from preparing kids to go to college, to the, the process, the process of, of, of entering college and, and then looking for ways that we can improve the whole system by, by innovation and research.

Speaker 1:          02:14          collegeboard.com was really begun, um, really at the sort of the hyper, the inner internet back about almost as an been almost nine years ago. And uh, I wanted, when I came to the college board, one of the first things I did was to create collegeboard.com cause I wanted us to be on the cutting edge. And it's been a really critical part of the growth and expansion of the, of the cause. But when I went to the college where we had about 400 employees, we now have about 1200 employees. We've, we've, we've, we've, uh, we've almost tripled what we've, what we do today from what we did in part of that was because we had the ability to communicate to kids through the, to students, through the Internet system. So I think it's been a very important, it's something that we continue to upgrade. It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a good service for parents and students to better, better it, to sign up to get information. It's, it's, it will become a bet bigger and more important thing for teachers to get information. And other educators to get information. So I think it's, uh, it's, it's, it's highly used. Uh, I think it's probably the, by far the busiest education website in the country. And, uh, it's given us a chance to speak to students, parents, and teachers and educators in a much more effective way than we could have if we hadn't had it.
