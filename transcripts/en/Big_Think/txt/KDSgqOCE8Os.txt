Speaker 1:          00:00          So the prefrontal cortex is guiding the process, but I think there's one, while we are discussing screens, metaphoric screens in different spaces where where the show is going on or auditory and tactile and so on. I think what is interesting is to think that those spaces, those performance spaces are separate. They're extremely sophisticated. They tend to be in terms of brain structure, very, very modern in evolution. They tend to have some of the most sophisticated circuitry. But take for example, the visual system. Our judicial system is an amazing instrument and of course the visual system that allows us to perceive right now something with the fine perception that I got, I can have over the depth of the color and your sweater and so on. Uh, all of that is extremely sophisticated, but then surrounding that, let's, let's consider that like an island and then surrounding that there's an ocean and that ocean is filled with knowledge of how different parts, different components of past perceptions have been put together in time when they were occurring. And so I think that that's an interesting analogy is the analogy of strings that pull the puppets are in the performance spaces and so it's not that we should privilege the performance spaces as the thing that matters, of course that matters very much because that's where our consciousness, our consciousness is actually occurring quote unquote, but it's occurring. They're only by the grace of this trains that are being pulled from the other space this elsewhere where you have what I like to call convergence divergence, which are end of themselves.

Speaker 2:          02:09          I just want to say, just pause for a second because this convergence divergence, um, this is, um, what you're, you're making a broader category for parts of the brain that, that I recognize, but you are putting it together in a larger context as I understand, after reading your book yesterday.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Good. Okay. Just, just to. I just wanted to give that info. Your spirit has tremendously anyway, but. So yeah, that's a very interesting because from a neutral standpoint, uh, you could even say that these structures are in of themselves rather dumb. It's not that they know anything consciously. What they know is that they have a sort of internal testimony of the simultaneous occurrence, occurrence of certain things at a certain point. So for example, if I will, uh, tomorrow remember talking to you today, uh, I will think of a certain words that you have said, pretty simple the sentence you just said about the book, which I probably will remember, uh, in some form and I will remember the fact that you have this sweater that I presume is spink, although I'm not very good with colored pink. Okay? Yes. Okay. And the pink and the white shirt and your beautiful blonde hair.

Speaker 1:          03:49          Uh, so how do I put this thing together? This is occurring right now and I am recording the simultaneity of occurrence of Your Voice, of certain ideas and certain requirements, but they are in different places. So we need to find in the brain a place where signals about all these different things can come together in, can make a record of the, the, the, the proximity and simultaneity of this in time. Yes. Temporality. We'll, we'll, we'll go there next. And once that happens, once that record is made, then it is possible to reactivate the record and to come back into the same regions where this is happening to us right now, and reconstruct something that he's going to be a paler version of the original, but it's going to relate to the original. And that, by the way, gets us into one very important issue, which is the issue that you don't have a, a facsimile memory of.

Speaker 1:          05:05          It's important. Yeah. I don't, I don't have a memory. I'm not going to have a polaroid picture. You right now talking to me. No soundtrack. What I'm going to have is all these bits and pieces of information with which I will be allowed to reconstruct something of this moment. But of course the reconstruction is not going to be entirely accurate. And who knows, maybe that in time I may even make a confusion and I could be asked the court to say what you're wearing. And I could say that you were wearing a blue eye. And I think this is, this is quite

Speaker 2:          05:43          important, um, that the fact that our brains and our memories are not like recording devices like film, um, and that, that is how we, some significant errors and those errors also can be created by an emotion attached to the experience so that you can even entirely invert a memory depending on the motivation in some way. And I don't mean conscious motivation, but they deeply embodied a drive or push sometimes that can have an emotional valence that will change memory. Yes.

Speaker 1:          06:26          People, you know, the, the testimonies in court very often affected. Yes. Yeah. You have all sorts of misattribution errors in versions of time sequence and so on. And that's because we don't have a filmic medium. We don't have cellulite with an optic soundtrack attached to it. What we have is this incredibly sophisticated mechanism of transforming is, it's almost like coding. You have this little bits and pieces that are occurring in time and then you have the possibility of reconstruction or react reactivation, which is very, very, very, very intriguing. And by the way, it's extremely economic. You know, the, the, the brain. Whenever it can, um, does things, I'm facilely and a leisurely and you know, if, if there's no need to repeat and reinvent the wheel,

Speaker 2:          07:23          well this is, this is very important for, um, perception because perception, the way we perceive things has to do with deep learning in the brain. And uh, one of my favorite philosophers who, you mentioned a footnote in your most recent book, Molly's mellow, pointy, talks about perception of something he calls stereotypes. And in neuroscience there's a similar idea, which is that the brain also will take in information according to its own expectations.

Speaker 1:          07:59          Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Because we don't, you know, it's not just that we have memory of the things that we have been living through since we were born. We have past memories that we have inherited a through a whole history of evolution before us. That in fact I have memories of things that our fore runners have been doing it. I'm not just talking about the human four runners, four runners that go all the way into reptiles and single cells, you know, things that have been done in a certain way in life, in life forms, in that course, of course, been memorized by the biological systems. We.
