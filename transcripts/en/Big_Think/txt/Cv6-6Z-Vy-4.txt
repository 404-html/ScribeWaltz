Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, actually that day, everything, fairly verizon in my life, I don't know what I don't know about anyone else's life, but in my life, everything for a reason and even bad things as far as reason that who knows, it might turn out for be something else. Um, but you know, I don't fight creativity. I don't fight against not being creative. If I'm not being creative and not forcing it, I just, that's it. I'm chilling. You know what I'm saying? What inspire me. Yeah. I want to say it's God. Yeah, Gia.

Speaker 1:          00:54          But I want to put it a different, we, we say it's the universe. You know, it's this thing that we don't know what it's called. Some people call it garden. People have different names for it. I don't know why they call it whatever you want to call it. I don't know. Sometime I just said the universe, that's what I call it at times. And that's what inspires me. You know, the universe. So that's, it did, I mean my kids, um, as I said before, bucking the D is Amir. But every now and again there is some social thing that was Pakistan. I song about justice, our Asana board, human rights are every know and again, there's something happening in the world where, uh, all right, that's sung inspired by what's happening. But a lot of times, no, I'm writing songs that, that, that has to do with it all I'd have to do with establishing um, oh, ah, reestablishing our connection to the universe. I was, oh, uh, oh, uh, spirituality, you know, re reconnecting our consciousness to universities that has nothing to do with physical things are social things are political things. It's all to do with spiritual things. And that's where I find that's where I love to write songs, the Moss in that place, not in the political social thing. I like to write songs in that spiritual please. That's, that's what that given the best feeling. You know, this advice I ever receive.

Speaker 1:          02:36          There's has been a few, but I must say today, the best advice I ever received is one that I would say I received from myself because it's based upon my experiences and the best advice I received from Maya said, if is follow your intuition, follow your mind. Cause mean many times I have not, and I've seen where I should have. So I, and you know each individual to each his own. It's not sometimes, not everybody's intuition is, is an thing. But where I am today in my life, my intuition, I should follow it. And that is, that is the advice I get from that inner voice inside of me. You know, that speaks, there's a voice inside them that speaks the truth. And I must always listen to that device. If I did, I wouldn't get money. You wouldn't be in general. Right? That's the lesson. That's the lesson zig and listened to that. That's, that's the lesson. That's what I'm talking about. I learned something, you know.
