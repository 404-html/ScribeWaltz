Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          double take magazine once printed a little pamphlet, which I listed 10 different things that you should, you should do. I can't remember all of them, but the first one was turned off the television set. I don't think you can, you can read poetry while you're watching television very well. The idea of how to read a poem is based on the idea that, uh, that poetry needs you as a reader, that the experience of poetry, meaning and poetry is a kind of circuit that takes place between a poet, a poem and a reader, and that meaning doesn't exist, or inherent poems alone that readers bring their own experiences, their own range of their own wisdom, their own knowledge, their own insights to poems and the meaning of a poem takes place in the negotiation between the poet, the poem and the reader. And then as a reader, you have a task to do.

Speaker 2:          01:05          You have something to do. You bring your experience to it. It's not all inherent in the poem. Um, the great Holocaust post-holocaust poet Paul Salon, said that a poem is a message in a bottle sent out in the not always greatly hopeful belief that somewhere and sometime it would wash up on land on heartland. Perhaps the idea of a poem is a message in a bottle means that it's sent out towards some future reader. And the reader who opens that bottle becomes the address. See of the literary Text Salon was picking up something that the Russian poet Osap Manuel Stem had written in 1916 called on the address. See. And Mondo stomp says a poet, you go down to the shore and you see an unlikely looking from a bottle from the past. You open it, model stem says it's okay to do so. I'm not reading someone else's mail.

Speaker 2:          01:58          It was addressed to ever found it. I found it, therefore it's addressed to me and that when you find it, you become the secret address. See of a literary text. And I felt that, um, the reader had been left out of this experience of reading poetry or what rate or what the experience of poetry was. And so my focus is on the reader and that the poets job is not to inspire himself or herself. The Post job is to inspire some future reader. And so as a reader, you have a task to do in finding those bottles and opening up the messages and experiencing what's in them inside of yourself.

Speaker 2:          02:42          I think that's a connection that you can only hope for. It's not something that you can make because it does, you know, it needs someone else. Um, I find in, in Walt Whitman and an American tradition, a certain kind of, I would say desperate American in which you reach out in which the poet tries to reach out through the page to make a connection by the side of the road with some other person. But ultimately that's, that's a longing, not a completion that has to be made by other readers. You can see clarity, you can seek warmth, you can try to make something for lasting. You can pick something in salt so that it's well made and you can hope that it out last time. But ultimately that's not up to you. Ultimately, you're trying to reach across and find some other person, some other human warmth, but it is, especially in written poetry. It is inscribed and attacks and the text can't do that. Work by itself and you as a poet can only do your best.
