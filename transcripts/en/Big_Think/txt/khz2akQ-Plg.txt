Speaker 1:          00:10          Well there is, there is no doubt that the whole discussion globally about how to deal with the climate crisis is still, uh, for most people, the most essential part. And it's, it would be very unfortunate unless we find ways to deal seriously with the climate crisis and to present it because, uh, that, eh, unless that happens, we certainly are not going to see sustainable development as we look ahead. I think, Eh, basically when you look at all the elements that, that are on the table and in the discussion even linked up to the climate change discussion, all the key issues linked to the sustainable development concept itself are part of that discussion. So it's not as if something has been completely lost as we focus on climate, because in the whole area of adaptation, uh, of, uh, all the sectors that need to be involved to deal with, uh, reducing the impact of on our climate, we touched most issues which are relevant in a sustainable development context.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Well, I think whether you look at the, the, the question of, uh, the way our democracies, most countries are today. Democracies, although not all, uh, democracy means public participation. And it means at the same time elected representatives and a democratic institutions that can help safeguard the way that people live together and the way we live in relationship with the surrounding world and our environment. So whether you look at it at national level or at the global level, there is this direct link between public participation and engagement and the way that leaders who have been elected, uh, or who are at least in any case, responsible for the future of their people, how they can act together and, uh, have addition and, and method of moving ahead in a consistent and sustainable manner.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I think it's true to say that, um, a lot of politics and the positioning and different, uh, national interests and perspectives have entered into this global and very key issue. Uh, this happens in many cases were important issues are at stake. So it's not something I'm only specific for the climate issue. But here you have major powers and you have major sectors, uh, businesses, uh, which have been used to having a strong influence, uh, in, in many countries. And they all are positioning themselves and pushing for their own interests, uh, even short term. So there is a challenge to people across the world to look beyond this and the challenge to leaders as we saw happening in Copenhagen, by the way, that they have to put their heads together and feel responsible as a team across borders, not just, uh, do, uh, politicking in their own national framework.
