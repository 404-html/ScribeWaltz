Speaker 1:          00:00          It played over to come back, uh, today I think he would have a lot to say about so many things, but, but crowd sourcing would be of great interest to him. I take plato to the Google plex and he's very, very interested in our technology and, uh, that, that would appeal to him very much. Um, but he gets into a conversation at the Google plex with a software engineer on a crowdsourcing and could crowdsourcing answer the kind of ethical questions that he first raised. And, um, he is, he's quite interested in this idea, but he's very, uh, he's very down. He's very much against it because, you know, he doesn't, he didn't have much of a faith in the ethical opinions of the masses. He thought that ethics was a kind of knowledge, um, that is extremely hard to attain. He's right. I mean, that's one of the reasons we've left him so far behind.

Speaker 1:          01:11          It's slowly, slowly where we make progress, ethical, ethical progress. Uh, but he thought it was a kind of knowledge and it takes a trained mind and, um, you know, it's harder than mathematics. Mathematics is a preparation for this kind of knowledge that you need, that kind of dispassion and distance and, uh, from your own life to be able to access ethical knowledge. So he would not have been very interested in crowdsourcing and what is the opinion of the masses of people. And he also would say, I think, well then, how do we ever make any ethical progress? How do we ever learn anything new, um, to, to challenge our, our intuitions, if in fact it's just being crowdsourced. I do have Plato, I'm getting quite addicted to the Internet and looking up things on, on the Jana wikipedia constantly. I mean, that was partly, I, I needed a quick way to bring him up to speed.

Speaker 1:          02:20          Uh, and, and he is constantly, we carries, he gets, well while he's at the Google plex, he gets a chromebook. Um, may give them a chromebook and he, he carries it with him everywhere. I mean, he's constantly consulting it. Uh, but again, he is, um, he believed in, in the expert. Uh, he believed, you know, an expertise. Uh, he, he, um, aristotle, his student was actually says some things that are much more, um, uh, continent or a favorable toward crowdsourcing. You know, he says that, you know, if you, um, go to, uh, a meal, if it's just cooked by one person, you may not like it. But if it's a feast with many, many people bringing their dishes, you'll find something to like, uh, aristotle says, and he really has an idea. They're a of crowdsourcing. Let's, let's try to get as many points of view as possible. Plato is, is very dubious of this. He, he believes that it's extremely difficult to know anything. It takes a tremendous amount of training, years and years of training. Um, he has the rulers of his state studying advanced mathematics for 10 years before they can even think about political philosophy. That's how hard he thinks these things are.
