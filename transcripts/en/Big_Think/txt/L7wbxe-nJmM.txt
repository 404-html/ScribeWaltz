Speaker 1:          00:07          Capitalism is based on a set of rational choice theory. Rational choice theory is I'm mathematic formulation that has demonstrably benefits in terms of avoiding, um, simple errors in judgment and decision making. Um, it's undergoing some revision because some of the biases and errors that we make, uh, can be understood and improve those formulas. But there are two assumptions underlying rational choice that are assumptions. They're not part of the mathematics, they're assumptions. One is, uh, because short term interests and the other is selfish interests. You do what's good for you. And it's as society becomes more complex, as scientific inquiry becomes more complex, has daily living, he comes more complex, um, coordinating our efforts together working so that we can trust one another. Uh, specialized, I can count on you to do a, and I'll do b and together a and b are more than the sum of the parts.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Um, that kind of problem solving which suggest selfish interests is an assumption that may have outlived its usefulness that it's not about being pure alteras. Uh, it's about coming up with something where you relate to other people in a fashion where everybody benefits more, where the sum is greater than the total is greater than the sum of the parts. And that's, uh, that's just an assumption. If we put that assumption in the rational choice theory, all of a sudden capitalism looks a little bit different. We look for sustainability, we look for things that are good for the community as well as for the company. Um, and you see such efforts, uh, southwest airline is just one airline that was built, uh, caring as much about their employees as the customers. And, uh, you know, southwest has been, uh, something of a business success stories. Some of the Asian companies are similarly constructed around a concern for the community and the employees, not just the stockholders. And that is again, they want to serve stockholders, but they want to serve beyond stockholders and a, those are again, some of the real success stories. So I think we're seeing precedents set and, and it can, it's not a denial of rational choice theory. It's really just a questioning of one of the assumptions underlying it. And I think there's, there's good reason to pursue what might, what might be done with capitalism with that assumption. A change.

Speaker 2:          02:49          CHICAGO, I've worked with

Speaker 1:          02:51          some economists sentence. One of the things that we look at are the errors. People making judgment. Um, oh, 35 years ago, economists never assume did rational choice that people were rational. They assume that irrationality was so irrational, is to be random. And economics isn't about predicting an individual behavior. That's the domain of psychology. Economics is about predicting aggregate behavior. Well, if I have complete irrationality, that's random, that's just like noise and I average over many such random noise. That sums does zero. So you're left with just rationality. Uh, I think what the last 30 years of research and particularly current research and behavioral economics and in neuroeconomics this showing us that the irrationality of systematic, it's not always random. There were systematic biases that we introduced. One of the biases that that people show is if they want to not come to be true, they overestimate the odds versus if they don't want the outcome to be true. And so that's it's bias that once you realize you can tweak the mathematics just so that it's more [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:02          presented about how humans actually think can be age. I think our research, Sean, what's fundamentally all about

Speaker 1:          04:12          human nature has implications for how we live our lives now. Businesses conduct research. Um, there is a sense in which bringing these teams together with different expertise gives you the opportunity to attack problems, come up with more creative solutions than not because of the complexity you need those different levels of expertise, but it bringing people together isn't sufficient. Being, overcoming loneliness isn't about just connecting with another person. It's connecting at a deep level. That's reinforcing for both individuals. Businesses if they understand that principle can understand that bringing experts together isn't sufficient. It's bringing the experts together and allowing them or promoting their connection so that it's beyond what would you normally would get. So, just to give you an example in the research domain, uh, I've been a member of research teams where we would fly into a vicinity. We meet, meet, meet. Once I flew to Bergen, Norway, which was a long flight.

Speaker 1:          05:19          We met in some hotel meeting room for two days and then flew home. I have no idea what Norway looked like. It was one of the most miserable meetings. I was just jet lag. That's all it was. And I'm sure we got something from the meeting, but not very much. Uh, there are other meetings. Uh, I, I run a large interdisciplinary team of wonderful, wonderful colleagues. The research in the book is really representing the work of many different scientific disciplines and expertise. Um, and when we, when we come together to meet, we meet off campus first of all and we meet off campus because when we're on campus, we're busy. I mean, we all have things going on and we, it's hard to disconnect our minds from our students and our colleagues and other demands when we go off campus. We also bring family with us and we have meetings only for about six hours a day and we have formal gatherings as a group.

Speaker 1:          06:13          We eat together, we break bread together, we'd go on outings together, we go for walks together in various sub pairings. And what that allows you to do is rather than saying this is what I know and promoting, that you start to like these people, you start to understand and want to want to understand more about their perspective. And so rather than relying just on what we all already agree so we can get outta here, you say, well, okay, that's what we all think, but that's the common knowledge and we all had that's not actually taking advantage of the expertise that unique. And really the reason we're all here is because of the unique knowledge, not the common knowledge. That takes longer and that unique knowledge starts to come out on these walks and it starts to come out in the meetings after you've done those walks because it's not about coming to a quick solution.

Speaker 1:          06:59          It's about coming to a playful that said, well tell me what you might know and why would you think that. I mean, and I'm not attacking you in that. I'm actually curious in that. So all of a sudden the language differences and the disciplinary differences are easier to bridge. I think that in that lesson in science, there's a lesson for businesses as well to bring together expertise and that expertise may be different, uh, parts of the product line or it may be labor versus management, different interests, expertise. How does one transcend and really do something that's better for everybody in the longterm? Because that's, that's what I think the secret of our, our species, we're very good at coming up with those new kind of social kind of construct. If you look at the emperor penguin, they require huddles to get through the winter there. I think they get together in this collective and without that collective, none of them would survive. Right? That's the vehicle for genetic transmission is this group that's bigger than the individual. That's the only collective unit. Humans have many such collectors and we can create them and recreate them on a moment by moment basis. And so the real talent and capacity comes from how do we configure those so that they're productive.

Speaker 3:          08:19          Yeah.
