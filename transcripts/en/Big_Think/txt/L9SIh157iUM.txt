Speaker 1:          00:07          I think this country is ready for a black president. Uh, not because he's black, not because everyone's come to some great racial understanding, but because he is who he is and because of his character, and because he is who he is as an individual and what he stands for and what he's, uh, and the kind of campaign he has run. I think America is ready for Barack Obama to be president. I don't know if they would have been ready for another black man to be president, but this black man, I think they're ready for him to be present.
