Speaker 1:          00:08          Yeah, I mean South Africa is a very interesting case right now because I think I'm politically what's happening is in the next couple and the next fortnight actually a new African National Congress president will be elected and whoever becomes president of the ANC effective, he becomes president of the country because they get sort of 65 percent of the vote in any national election. And the front runner at the moment is this, the Sky Jacob Zuma, who was deputy president and then got fired because he's, um, he was charged with both rape and corruption. He got acquitted on the rape charge that said the most horrific, um, ms dot dennis stick things during the trial and the corruption charges being sort of put off and put off and put off in these something, you know, some funny business going on there. But the reason he is interesting is, um, he has massive popular support among low, low, low class, um, South Africans who I think feel that, you know, it's been too long now since 94 and they're not seeing the kind of practical material changes in their lives and you know, houses running water, electricity.

Speaker 1:          01:19          And so there's a kind of, um, radicalism that's sort of um, being fostered at that level. And for some reason Zuma has captured the imagination of these people and he is not being seen as the antidote to. I'm the kind of politicians like in Becky who's the current president or a lot of the extremely wealthy, um, black businessmen like Tokyo, six waller who's a, basically a mining magnets. So I think it's a, what's coming to hid non South Africa is this thing of what happened is a lot of the wealth was just sort of transferred from this tranche of elite whites to elite blacks and the people on the ground. So nothing changed in their lives. And so there's a, there's a kind of a backlash against that. And so it's playing out more along class lines now than it is along race lines. Racist still used as a galvanizing factor politically.

Speaker 1:          02:21          So, um, you know, Zuma will often use whites as scapegoats to sort of get people riled up. But really it's an issue of, um, feeling like not enough has happened to kind of change the economics of the country in a way that benefits ordinary South Africans that makes him sound like I'm a much better person than he is. I mean, I think this is one of the things that worries me a lot at the moment. It's like watching a train smash about to happen. Um, and the, the global community doesn't really seem to see how terrible it would be if he becomes president. I mean, there's nothing you can do, but I think if he became president, South Africa would go the way of Zimbabwe within five to 10 years. I think he would do a land grab. I think he would have nationalized all sorts of things. But I think he's a leader who has absolutely no. Um, no qualms about, um, you know, doing what is best for him and um, scared.

Speaker 2:          03:34          Hmm.
