Speaker 1:          00:10          Software unification. Uh, so that I no longer care what computing device I pick up, whether it's a laptop or a desktop, whether it's one I own are one in a public place. Uh, whether it has a small screen or a large screen. Uh, I sit down, identify myself, I tune in my information world. Uh, I get it in the same way on a no screen computer in a car. Um, uniform access across all platforms, computers, telephones to my entire information life. It's easy to achieve in hardware. They're hard software issues, but they should have been solved 15 years ago.

Speaker 1:          01:03          So long from the other side of the fence is, um, if I were to invest in a, in a new company, I would invest in some of the companies that are working on so called digital furnaces. Uh, in five years everybody throws out all his cds and dvds. There are larger MP3 players. A home stereo system is and t v V systems are integrated and this is a billion multibillion dollar transition. As things stand, it will be Sony and Google, a Toshiba, a few with very large companies doing it. And they won't, they won't do it badly, but they won't do it. Well. Uh, I would invest in, in one of the small companies that has imaginative instead of recycled ideas as to how to make that transition.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Uh, I, you know, I, I, the one of the spaces I'm really watching very carefully is the mobile space. And I think that for a long time, innovation on the mobile platform was held back by the carriers and their control over everything and they're sort of passion to control everything. Um, now that we're getting some brands of phones that are consumer brands that are popular enough that we're starting to get the correct kind of a separation of, uh, you know, people say, I want an iphone or I want to, I Google phone an android phone, right? People start to say those kinds of things. Um, and those are the, those are the brands they want. And the carrier is just whoever you give service from. And if we can break that, that, that control that the carriers have had over the platform, then we get the same kind of innovation that we had, um, on computers and the Internet. People can be building apps and doing all kinds of crazy things. And I don't know what's gonna come out of that. Uh, I just know that when you, when you put together a platform, people can innovate on interesting things end up happening.

Speaker 2:          03:06          Uh, boy, uh, I've, uh, I don't know. I mean, I'm obviously looking forward to what's going to happen in media and the way that people consume a content. That's what I'm most interested in. So, um, clearly the whole idea of mobile in the idea that you are carrying around with you, a screen that can go with you and know where you are and know who your friends are, uh, utilizing that kind of a technology to immerse yourself into the world of a narrative is something that I'm most interested in. How to create narrative that, um, that helps people understand what their places in the world and how to make the world a better place. So those kinds of technologies are most interesting to me. You know, again, right now I'm interested, I'm interested in as a storyteller in uh, in trying to use narrative to, to promote good in the world. So I'm interested in companies that are, uh, that are philanthropic by nature and are trying to um, uh, to promote, uh, the greater good. So, um, technology that's designed to make the world a better place. Uh, it's, it's the most interesting to me.

Speaker 3:          04:25          I think what I've heard is a lot more disruption going on and that's exciting because it means there are new opportunities. It's frightening too, but I find optimism and excitement in disruption kind of on a, but I think that the answer might be that the streamed web is important. We thought the web was about content like ours sites and pages, but I think now we see with twitter and rss and email all adding up, it says new streamed live web and it's going to be hard to get used to that next never ending web of content.

Speaker 2:          05:01          Well, I think we're going to have great new ways to interface with information. And you know, that's on normal desktop and laptop computers, but also mobile devices. And I think we'll see much more interactivity in the way we interface with things. And we'll see much more richness in the communication between the computer and humans. Oh Gosh. I don't have a specific company. I know some directions I would, I would bet on, I bet on, uh, interactivity moving forward a great deal. I bet on applications replacing or supplementing documents for describing things for content. So I think we'll see media outlets produce very active content in the future that, that readers can kind of interact with. So those are some, some of the directions that I think will be exciting.
