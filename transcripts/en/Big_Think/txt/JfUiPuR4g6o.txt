Speaker 1:          00:03          Unfortunately, I think everyone thinks they're funny maybe. And so few people actually are, I think there's a certain type of bully humor, bullies throughout history and including people who have become some of the most powerful people in the world. You know, they just use their humor to make other people feel small and to be like every joke they they make is at someone's expense. And um, almost bragging about how much more powerful they are then the other person. And that to me is not the greatest sense of humor to have because um, while it's fun to slam your friends, I think, um, you really don't have a lot of empathy for the, for the bully who's using humor. I think the instinct to be self deprecating starts when you're young and, and you know, you, you don't take yourself too seriously when you're not popular in the world and your peers don't seem to be taking you seriously.

Speaker 1:          01:03          You know, I remember in high school for some reason I just heard that there was a huge dude who was, who really didn't like me, who wanted to beat me up as far as I was concerned. I had never met him, but it was just one of those things where he had found someone smaller than him to pick on. And so I remember just using humor to disarm him and like he got in my face one day and I just was like, come on man. I started, I started acting like really huge and tough. I'm like, come on, I'll take you down. Come on Bro. Come at me Bro. And he just started laughing and was like, Ha, you're funny man. And then after that we were friends. I was getting mugged once and um, I just ended up talking to the guy for 20 minutes and I'm trying to make him laugh.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And at the end of it he was like, ah, you're too nice of a guy. All right, I'll see you later. That's sort of skill, um, can really come in handy when you feel as if the world is against you in a way to not take yourself seriously. I think the, the, the world then has empathy for you. You always see it when you're taking a public speaking class. They always say, start off with a joke. Um, you know, it's, people don't want to have lives where they're sitting there being bored by people all the time. And you know, when, when you're in charge of a company, people usually hate their boss because they're mean all the time. You know, humor is a great tool to use to just get people on your side.

Speaker 2:          02:40          Mm, okay.
