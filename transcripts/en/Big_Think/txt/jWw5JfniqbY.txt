Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:04          I think one of the great things I love about San Francisco is so fun. I just love the typography offer. It was a great walk into and you just, you can walk around San Francisco and suddenly you know, you, you, you get up and one of the hills and you're looking over the city and you're just go a completely different aspect. You couldn't believe that you, you're, you're just a marriage, don't to this. So when you can just see all over the place, you dip down into the, into the skin to get Kinda cool neighborhood you've never seen before and it's obviously because of it's always, again, it's changed me. All American cities are changing because of maybe, maybe San Francisco. I was going to say that affluence is as driven out the ash to San Francisco. We used to go there and you're used to and know the economically disadvantaged. I used to fly to San Francisco and people used to go there for the vibe and the whole hippie thing and stuff like that and but I'm not. It's the recession might kind of ironically might restore the glory of San Francisco and away know and stop being this kind of Yuppie Paradise, which is kind of just become the whole silicon.
