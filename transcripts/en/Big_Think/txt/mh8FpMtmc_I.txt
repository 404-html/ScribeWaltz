Speaker 1:          00:06          The best ones I go to are divided between the ones that I will go to once a month forever. That I just, I it, you know, I just

Speaker 2:          00:19          second there are all the time. Love it. I always go back for something that's a part. Then I check out almost every significant new restaurant. I live in New York, so in New York, but wherever I am, I'm always interested in what's new, what young chefs are doing, what's going on. And I'll go there once or twice sometimes I get obsessed with a new restaurant and I'll go every other day for a month. But um, that's sort of like the new restaurant piece and then there are major restaurants that when I'm really almost in a Rut when it comes to creating new recipes or thinking about food I go to because they're always inspirational. They're always amazing and they, they always give me something and sort of restore my faith in cooking and they're, they're sort of the temples that are necessary. I'll give you a couple from each category.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Uh,

Speaker 2:          01:15          the restaurants that I go to once a month because they just feel great. A bow is, are the oyster bar grand central. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:28          uh,

Speaker 2:          01:31          well let's just say those are two good examples. And I would put bond street actually in that category. Uh, I would say all three of those are places that are bustling. The food is really excellent quality. I mean, in the case of oyster bar, I only eat oysters there, but the food, the food is really excellent quality. Uh, and it's just a bustling, great feeling place. That's that. That's that kind category. The new restaurants, like what's new and exciting. You know, I went to this place called del Anima the other night, which was really, really good. Really exciting. Um, this,

Speaker 1:          02:10          uh,

Speaker 2:          02:11          let me see. New is always hard because it's a total crapshoot. You know, you're, you're, I want to see what's going on and what's out there and one out of 10 will be, um, will be terrific, you know. So right now for there's a kind of Italian resurgence in New York, actually. A morality is not that new, but that's a restaurant that I, I ate at, I would say,

Speaker 2:          02:40          you know, I, I got, I got my credit card statement the other day and it was like the only, the only merchant on it was Miranda I ate, they're probably like, you know, 20 times a month for three months. And um, I was just interested. I thought the chef was doing certain things I was really, really interested in. And um, and then the, the high holy restaurants that I have to go back to. Absolutely Babo. I just think Mario Batali, he can do no wrong in my book. He's amazing. And Babo is, it's amazing. Yeah. You can't get a reservation there. It's so difficult to get a reservation, but. So you would think that it's kind of like, oh, so they get into a routine and it doesn't have to be that great because. And meanwhile, every single time you go there, you have something that you haven't had before.

Speaker 2:          03:25          That's totally seasonal. Brilliant. It feels like it's existed forever, except you've never actually had that dish. And it's genius. And George, I feel the same way it was on. George is interesting to me because the service there is so pristine that you, it's just, it's just a beauty super hold. It's a beauty to feel what modern perfect service can be like. And then of course the food is always interesting, always exciting, always. Uh, it always has flavors that are lovely and wonderful. And then there are those three categories you can tell. I absolutely love eating at restaurants. Then of course there is ethnic food which I eat a lot of and I mainly depend on cab drivers for my recommendations. And a, there's just, you know, New York is just like a paradise for that.
