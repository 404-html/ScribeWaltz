Speaker 1:          00:08          Question, I think we're gonna lose a lot, almost whatever we do because there's so many species right now that are on the brink of extinction. I mean the break, there are a number of trees, species and flowering plants. We should what you're known for one individual and there are a bird species for example, that are down to a few dozen individual. We have to rhinoceros species two out of the five that existed on the planet that are 300 individual or fewer left. So a lot of those we're going to lose probably no matter what we do, especially those which we don't even know yet exist. And we may never know they ever existed. If they go extinct before we can learn enough about the world's biodiversity. But if we plan our use of the environment in the future intelligently and drive towards the goal of sustainable development, that is a development in producers, increasing quality of life and security for people, uh, but reduces the amount of materials and energy that we're using up. And if we intelligently plan a, the establishment of reserves where, uh, we get the maximum protection for the largest number of species. And that's one thing. The conservation organizations like conservation international, which we have served on the board, are devoted. Uh, then I think we'll save a majority of the remaining pictures.
