Speaker 1:          00:00          Never read on your friends and always keep your mouth shut. If you elevate loyalty over trip, you've got a situation like barry bonds, personal trainer, Greg Anderson. He was initially questioned about whether he gave steroids, are injected barry bonds with steroids. He law and he said he never did. Then when called before the grand jury, he refused to testify. He was held in contempt of court. He was put in jail on multiple occasions for remaining silent and one, one of those occasions when he was released from jail, all the inmates gathered around and gave him a standing ovation. Well, this to me pretty much says it all. Loyalty over truth means this is the code of the prison yard. This is the code of organized crime. This is the code of the Mafia.

Speaker 2:          00:42          Yes,

Speaker 1:          00:44          they weren't going to prosecute use of steroids, but they wanted to nail this guy for distributing it. So Barry bonds was called before the grand jury. He had been given immunity. The only thing he could be prosecuted for perjury or false statements, he took the oath. They then ask him, did you use steroids? No. Were you ever injected with steroids? No. He lied repeatedly to the grand jury. Why did it take eight years from the time that barry bonds allegedly lodge to the grand jury until he was actually tried for the case? It was because everyone was long. In that case, it was worldclass lying on a massive scale, and all the prosecutors could do was investigate people for perjury where they couldn't get to the underlying crimes. Loyalty, loyalty to one's employer. Loyalty to a benefactor is a very powerful countervailing force. There must be some kind of punishment and accountability in an ancient Rome. People were put to death in medieval England. They had their tongues cut out. I'm not saying we need to go to, is that barbaric? Extreme, but there must be visible accountability for breaking the law.

Speaker 3:          01:51          Yeah.
