Speaker 1:          00:05          If you don't have anything to look up to, you don't have anything to do, right? A lot of the meaning that people find in their lives is purpose driven. And in order to put effort into something, to work towards something, you have to assume axiomatically that what you're working towards is better than what you have because why else would you do it? And there's a relationship, like if it's way better than what you have, it's obviously proportionally difficult. So you try to balance difficulty with, with positivity, let's say something like that. But you're always aiming up if you're aiming and if you're not aiming, then you don't really have any purpose. And that deprives your life of meaning. And that's not good. Because if your life is deprived of meaning, then what you're left with is the suffering. It's not neutral, right? It's negative. So now the problem with having to a mop is that that produces a hierarchy, right?

Speaker 1:          01:00          Because if you pause it an aim, then everyone a raise themselves along a hierarchy of better at it, to worse at it, right? And it doesn't matter. Like if, if you, if you create basketball as a game a hundred years later, you create people who are hyper specialized at basketball and they're great at it and virtually everyone else is bad. So it doesn't matter. As soon as you produced a value, a value proposition, you produce a hierarchy. The problem with the hierarchy is it produces inequality. The problem with inequality is it produces resentment, right? But you can't get rid of the damn hierarchy because they produce inequality and resentment because then you don't have anywhere to go. So that's not an answer. Okay? So let's say you're trying to deal with the fact that you have to put up with a hierarchy. If you're going to have any values, well, how do you escape from the resentment trap?

Speaker 1:          01:55          And the answer is you do an intelligent multidimensional analysis of your life. It's like, by the time you're 30 I would say you're a pretty singular person. You know, you're, you're, you're unique in particular and your life has multiple dimensions and you're more or less successful, or not along many of those dimensions, but it's completely ridiculous game to pick someone else arbitrarily who's doing much better than you on one of those dimensions, to assume that you're a failure because of that or that the world is unfair because of that, without knowing in full detail all of the rest of the elements of their lives. I mean, look, we're absolutely the awash in stories of unhappy celebrities. You know, [inaudible] an interminable divorces or an in affairs or in addictions or, and that's par for the course. It's not helpful. It's helpful to have a goal. It's necessary to have a hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          02:53          It's not particularly useful to compare yourself to other people, but it is useful. Compare yourself to yourself. That's the right baseline, right? That's takes everything else into account and, and it's really practically useful. And I, I've done this in my clinical practice very frequently. It's like, okay, let's take stock of where you are. Okay? And then let's, let's hypothesize about where you would like to be. It's a complex conversation, right? Because we want to figure out what's not so good about your present situation. Exactly. Precisely. And then come up with a hypothesis about what your life would look like if it was better. And then we can work on incremental improvement. No idea would be, there's some step you could take that you would take that would make today or tomorrow fractionally better than yesterday. Right? And then you can iterate that and that's actually unbelievably powerful. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:47          you hit the effect of compounding interest, let's say very, very rapidly if you do that. Yeah, well, so there's real utility and incremental progress and you don't have to improve your life much in increments to start hitting the effect of compounding interest. You know, you make one thing slightly better and that increases the probability that you'll make the next things slightly better as well as having its positive side effects. And so if you, even if you make small steps forward and you do that regularly, that can turn your life around very rapidly over like a one to two year period. I mean, that's a long time, one to two years. But it's not a lifetime and it certainly beats the hell out of going downhill precipitously, which tends to be the alternative. So it's better and it keeps you out of the resentment, you know?

Speaker 1:          04:34          And it's also more realistic because it's not like, it's not like everyone else doesn't have their problems. You know, we, we have these fictitious successful people that it's easy for us to compare ourselves to detrimentally and to become jealous and bitter about that, but also to be very hard on ourselves because we're not successful. It's like if you talk to successful people, let's say, and I'm not trying to say that there's no such thing as genuine accomplishment because obviously there is, but people, even people who are successful have lives that are very difficult and you know, they have, uh, an ill family member or aged parents or, or they're suffering from some serious illness themselves, which is very, very common. Or they have a psychological problem that's not trivial or they have a traumatic past. It's like life is brutal. And, and becoming resentful about your relative position is a way to make it more brutal. It's not helpful to you and it's not helpful to anyone else.

Speaker 2:          05:40          Yeah.
