Speaker 1:          00:09          Yeah. Preparing for an earthquake is multifaceted, multi dimensional. And the first thing really is being aware. Uh, yes, I've said that earthquakes and occur anywhere, but they're more likely some places than others. So you know, basic awareness of where your house, where you work, uh, where you are relative to the faults that might cause an earthquake. That's a matter of public education. Um, but once you know what you're a risk might be, uh, you have to bake some sort of personal judgment or if you're a government, some sort of social judgment about the level of risk that you're willing to accept it is going to be. And if you're willing to accept or only willing to accept a low level of risk, then there are a number of things you need to do. You do to ensure that major infrastructure is resilient, that our water lines are power lines are built in such a way so that they won't break that bridges and highways one fall down, that fire stations will remain standing so that the fire personnel can respond and that hospitals remained standing, um, with respect to individuals in their homes.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Uh, if you're in an earthquake zone, ensuring that your building is up to code, if a code exists, um, ensuring that you follow that code and even little things like keeping the knickknacks away from the edge of the shelf, keeping your dishes way back. Those are the sorts of things that can make the difference between sort of a Ho hum boy was at an interesting event to something that was a disaster. Um, and these were all written down. You can go to the fema websites, you sgs websites, there were a whole list of these things. The problem arises when first you don't have building codes, uh, or those codes aren't enforced. That was a situation Haiti, where you don't have the national or social wealth to actually consider this something you can do. I mean they're the, I don't mean to bring up Haiti constantly, but the issue there was that there were so many sort of day to day problems facing a Haiti culture in Haiti government.

Speaker 1:          02:20          That's something that might happen. Uh, really can't get on the radar screen. And you could argue the right or wrong to that, but that basically is a situation and sad to say that's tap us throughout the world. Um, so you know, the basic things really quite easy to do if you've got the money to do them and if you've got the public awareness to do them and if you've got the political will to do them. If you're dealing with the Commons, if you're dealing with infrastructure, uh, where you don't have the political will or the wealth, uh, there are a number of things that the community is trying to do. There's a lot of concentration on building small scale community awareness so that the awareness of disaster, the awareness of potential disaster I should say, uh, occurs almost at the household level and enabling people to make decisions but also giving them sort of the simple things that they, that they could do on a day to day basis.

Speaker 1:          03:17          Not just for earthquakes but for floods, for landslides. Uh, and for that matter, for longer term issues like sea level rise and climate change. Uh, you know, one of the, one of the key things that we're doing at our institute and elsewhere is trying to, to bring the knowledge we have about earth processes. You're said dynamic planet. It's fun to look at. We enjoy doing that, but it affects people. And one of the things we're trying to do is to bring that knowledge, not just throw it over the fence so that policy makers can use it. Because, you know, there's none of a feedback and that kind of a system. Uh, we really, scientists need to understand social and cultural constraints on using the information. And in fact, even the utility of the information that they provide. And if I may say, I think the social scientists and governments and ngos need to know what they don't know, and that's a difficult task. Uh, but to be honest, it's an interesting and important thing to do and we're getting better at it.
