Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay,

Speaker 2:          00:07          personally, today I'm in a very interesting stereophonic Ka Ka Ka conversation, uh, in, in, in one ear. Alright, I hear beautiful symphonic music. It, it comes from a person like a Gordon Brown in the UK. It comes from a person like, uh, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi who says I want to build in Abu Dhabi where were, were, were today. This the beginnings of an idea capital, a full idea capital. I talked to lead leaders like a Gordon Brown and Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. And I hear from them first of all that they embraced the notion that the world of the 21st century is going to be a world of, of ideas that that education and education has the highest level. It's going to be the key to unlocking that and, and that they see as the future of their societies investing heavily on the public sphere, investing heavily in, in, in higher education and access to higher education for, for every talented student and, and for system that builds to plus the students as far up the talent, talent pyramid as, as, as they can be pressed.

Speaker 2:          01:30          On the other hand here in the United States, I hear very, very few of our political leaders grasping that concept and dedicating themselves to it. You hear a person like Mike Bloomberg in New York who, uh, it sees the fact that, that maintaining New York as, as one of the few idea capitals of the world is key to the city's future and building the infrastructure educationally from kindergarten right through the leading research universities we have in the city is, is pivotal to New York maintaining it's positioned. But, but what you begin to see dangerously is, is most of our political leaders actually on the other side of the equation. So in the other ear, in the stereophonic world in which I live in, in the other ear, I hear kind of grading a total music coming from the political leadership, uh, in, in the United States where, where they've begun to demagogue around issues of higher education.

Speaker 2:          02:36          So you hear a constant connection of, of, of, you know, healthcare costs and the cost of higher education. A very simplistic, appealing and the talking point message, especially to the middle class for whom, uh, uh, the higher education costs are all seem to be skyrocketing. And uh, it, it, it's very easy to run past the fact that, uh, at, at, at, at most of the great universities of this country where tuition, yes, is going up, uh, it, it, it's, it, it's going up because of the pressure of providing the kind of quality education you have to provide the, it's going up because the cost of books and technology are going up. It's going up because knowledge is expanding and it's more to cover and therefore you have to hire more faculty to do. And it's going up because every single reform you want to make to provide a better education as students to come to you involves lowering the student faculty ratio, which means increasing your personnel costs.

Speaker 2:          03:40          And universities are essentially when you, when you boil everything down, essentially irreducibly, they are socrates and the tree and the student. And, and it's, it's, it's the problem of the live string quartet. You know, how the personnel intensive a system. That's what a university is. It's personal intensive faculty. Students are, if you, if you have a live string quartet, you don't, you can't use technology, you can't, you can't take the music because then it's not live. You can't cut your personnel costs. That is not a quartet, a, you can't play the music faster because then it's not really the music. And that's what we're in, is engaged in, in a high class education. So, so, uh, the politicians in the United States as they, as, as they appealed glibly to the, you know, the cost of higher education, I began to pound that which makes this country very special.

Speaker 2:          04:44          I mean higher education is the pride of this country. If they act as if there's some kind of a monopoly out there among the 6,500 actors in higher education, diversity as we are, that is involved in a conspiracy to build the middleclass of their money. You know, this could not be more wrong and it could not be more shortsighted. So here I am in the stereophonic conversation where outside the United States people are getting the idea that what, what, what you need to have the, the, the, the future to own the future, to be one of the idea capitals in this matrix world of idea capitals. You need great higher education. And here in the United States we're in the process of, of, of, of, of a devaluing that. So we're in the process of, in a world where we dominate today, and I guess this isn't a good metaphor to use given the present state of the Yankees, but I'll use it anyway speaking more to the glory of the franchise. Over time we're in the process of turning the Yankees into the mud hens. Well now the rest of the world is saying we're, we're, we're, we're, we're going to create what you have and if you look 25 and 50 years after, it's a very dangerous world for the United States. How do you change that? You change it by issuing the clarion call, uh, to, to, to the political leadership to begin to take the long view. Even though, even though it may not be the politically effect, the view.
