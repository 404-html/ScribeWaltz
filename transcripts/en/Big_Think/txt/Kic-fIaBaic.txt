Speaker 1:          00:03          I was raised with a Tarion. Um, and

Speaker 2:          00:08          my mother said she took us to church so that we wouldn't,

Speaker 3:          00:13          uh, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:14          Get religious later in life. She was above and both my parents were atheists and my grandmother was an atheist and in rural Kentucky. And so they were trying to make sure that my brother and I would be atheist too. And it worked, which doesn't mean that we didn't, they didn't teach us a lot of, uh, sort of wonder of science and of nature in the world and all of that. I think they gave us all of that, but they are

Speaker 1:          00:40          both highly skeptical people. I got that to be, um,

Speaker 2:          00:54          yeah, no, it, it didn't, the only problem was that my mother's parents were southern Baptists and devout and it was very upsetting them to the idea,

Speaker 3:          01:03          mmm.

Speaker 2:          01:04          That we didn't believe in God. So I told him that I did because I thought that was really cool because they were worried that we would go to hell. So, um, my grandmother asked me

Speaker 1:          01:14          once, she said, I don't care about anything except that you count what you believe in God. I think in this next one I'm working on for sure because it

Speaker 2:          01:27          definitely reared its head in modern day talking. And I mean, I, I just came from an interview where Lewis Black was coming in right after me and I had met him before and we talked about all of this. And, um, it's everywhere. Everyone's talking. There's, there's of course, a huge evangelical movement recently and now there's a, there's an atheist movement that often seems to me, I was raised to be really nice to people and kind of out there beliefs. Um, and so a lot of it seems really overly self righteous, odd. Like in the same way that evangelicals are where it is. I just think it's not,

Speaker 1:          02:02          I don't believe any of that stuff,

Speaker 4:          02:03          but I don't, not mad about it.
