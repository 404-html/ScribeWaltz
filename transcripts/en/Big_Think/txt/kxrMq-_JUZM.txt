Speaker 1:          00:00          There's a great saying that wikipedia works really well in practice, just not in theory, and that is true wikipedia success is so singular, so spectacular that figuring out whether it's a model for anything other than Wikipedia is a puzzle that even the folks behind Wikipedia have faced as they've tried to do wiki search, Wiki news and [inaudible] Harry at different times, but the idea of having a scheme where the day to day governance, the day to day edits, whether done for substance to improve the truth level of an article in the view of the editor or done for process, oh, that edit shouldn't have been made a breaks. The following rule, I'm going to revert it to have the people doing that be members of the public at large is an extraordinary devolution of responsibility out to people who are in one way or another implicitly or explicitly sort of taking an oath to subscribe to the principles behind Wikipedia of neutrality, of fairness, of learning, kind of the values of the enlightenment and cannot survive itself over the long haul.

Speaker 1:          01:11          I don't know. As you get more and more importance attached to Wikipedia, more and more places that draw from wikipedia as a source of data, whether it's something like the Wolfram Alpha knowledge engine or google to assemble basic facts for results in a search, there may be more and more reason for entities to want to gain the results. If you could just put yourself in the Guinness Book of World Records for having the longest beard or something and you don't actually have to grow anything, it's like, well, why not? I'll vote myself rich. These are problems that wikepedia has had to deal with so far, relatively successfully. And uh, there's a level of humility that I think it has to maintain in order to recognize new problems, to recognize where there might be structural forms of bias or discrimination going on and to be able to endure the more targeted intentional attempts to basically poison the well of truth that wikipedia at least aspires to be.

Speaker 1:          02:15          What would I propose as a longer term way of shoring it up? I think we should solve a problem with a problem we haven't really figured out, uh, in the early 21st century, what to do with kids who are in school for hours at a time, every day sort of warehoused in daycare. I think it would be wonderful to make as part of the curriculum from say sixth grade onward, part of your task and it will be graded on, is to edit and make the case for your edits to an article on a service like wikipedia. And then we'll have new ranks of people being supervised by teachers who are working on the articles and on the product. And that may be even we'll apprentice to the norms by which you have an argument over what is true and what isn't. And maybe some of them will choose to continue on his wikipedia guns, uh, even after the assignment is over. So to me, if I think of an advanced civics class, it's great to learn that there are three branches of government and you know, x vote gets you a veto, but a overrides a veto. But having the civics of a collective hallucination like wikipedia also be part of the curriculum, I think would be valuable.
