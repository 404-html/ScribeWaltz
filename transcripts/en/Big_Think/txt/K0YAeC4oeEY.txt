Speaker 1:          00:10          We launched the Parkinson's initiative with Michael J, Fox and the Parkinson's institute in out here, and we have individuals with Parkinson's. We're given a discounted version of the 23 and me, so we've designed the 23 and me site so that individuals can get access to their data, they can fill out surveys specifically about Parkinson's as well as about their general health, um, and they get all the other access, so in information about their ancestry, they can connect and share with individuals. There's a community portion they can learn from people. So we want to have a really engaging experience for people so that we can keep getting information from them. So we have one Parkinson survey now we will plan to have additional Parkinson surveys because the longterm goal is how do I get information about you today, but let's say I want to know how does your Parkinson's progress in 12 months in 24 months and 48 months because that information will be really valuable to correlate with your genetic information.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So then comes in 23 and we on the back end, our researchers in house are actually analyzing all the data, so all the information that we're collecting through the surveys, they then compare with the genetic information and what we're finding is we're actually making really interesting discoveries. So I'm on all the different questions that we're asking about. So we'll hope to announce soon information about, you know, because as Parkinson's community came together, what are some of the discoveries that we have made and what are those discoveries, what kinds of discoveries will benefit that community. So that might also integrate with a lot of the clinical trials that are happening where clinical trials are happening, you know, either on drugs where we can potentially help figure out why some people respond, some people don't respond what, where there's toxicity or toxicity. Um, and some, a lot of the Parkinson's patients are eager to participate in clinical trials. So we might be able to help make sure that they're, they can find a clinical trial that makes sense for them.

Speaker 1:          02:07          I think the biggest problem in clinical trials is that they're underpowered and that fundamentally the studies are just too small and they're designed in such a way because they're so expensive, they're designed in such a way that they're just, there's a small cushion and so, you know, they're expensive to run if you need, if you need a thousand patients to really get the clinic the power that you're looking for, maybe you have 1100. Um, but what we're finding is that those actually are still under powered. So the advantage of 23 and me that we can do is we can actually have huge datasets where we're not looking to collect, you know, 100 people with cancer or a thousand people with multiple sclerosis. We want, you know, tens of thousands. So the Parkinson's initiative, we've announced, you know, we have over 3000 people with Parkinson's in it, which is, you know, on a relative basis, one of the largest cohorts out there now.

Speaker 1:          02:53          So we're looking to develop these large cohorts and keep asking questions. Um, I think one of the other advantages that we have is that we can ask these Parkinson's patients about their Parkinson's, but we're also learning about all these other aspects of them. So we asked the general health survey and then we're asking you about commonly used drugs, so, you know, do they get a stomach ache when they take advil, how do they respond to Benadryl, things like that. So it's a cohort where we can keep learning more and more things from them. I think we're very focused on developing, um, or understanding the relationship between genetics and drug response. And so that could be either on the efficacy side or the safety side, but you know, there's, it's a well known studies that have come out that said 50 percent of all drugs that we take to have no effect on you. So what we would like to understand is if you're given a drug is going to respond yes or no, and is it going to be safe, yes or no? And that's going to be a critical mission of 23. And me.
