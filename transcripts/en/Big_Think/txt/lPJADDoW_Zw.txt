Speaker 1:          00:10          I don't know about alcohol and creativity. I think, uh, you know, I think that the, the classic idea that, oh, look, all these artists, these great artists and great writers drank a lot, therefore I better drink a lot. Uh, I, you know, I think that probably has, you know, that, that, that desire to embrace, uh, um, the, the ID souped up on alcohol is probably a lead. People astray more than it's helped them. Um, you know, but, you know, I certainly am not going to tell people they should, they should be teetotallers are never smoked pot or never take drugs, you know. Uh, I have, I have taken drugs and smoke pot and drunk too much, uh, in my life. Has it made, has it helped my creativity? No, but, uh, I think, you know, life has no life must be lived, uh, in all of it with all of its bumps and ups and downs and, and, and, but in the end, you know, you need to be clearheaded enough to actually do the work and the work of, of the creative work. It seems to me, uh, is in the doing of it is not very enhanced by being drunk or being stoned.
