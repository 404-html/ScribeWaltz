Speaker 1:          00:08          I grew up in the suburbs of New York. I was very fortunate in that I had a really good public education and that public education actually led me to the Rockefeller when I was 16. I was passionate about biology and the Rockefeller has a series which they still have of lectures called the holiday lectures, which are lectures for high school students right after Christmas and now I guess there's a whole sort of internet way of getting the tickets if you're interested. But then that wasn't. The Internet didn't exist so the. The way that they were distributed with each high school in the area got to and so they were quite quite a valuable commodity at my high school among the students who were interested and I was given one and so I guess it was in 1976 in December. I had the great fortune of hearing Christian to do speak about the cell and he gave this amazing tour of the interior of the stem cell, which I could probably sit here and spend about an hour telling you about.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Which is kind of amazing because it was so long ago. But it was a brilliant lecture and in fact the lecture is referred to in a book that he wrote called vital dust, which is also a wonderful book, but I was just inspired and I, I, at that moment, I knew that this was what I wanted to do, what he didn't know what that moment was. That was the place that I was getting ended up doing it. I didn't ever dream that I would be that fortunate and I, through a series of coincidence, coincidence, I got a summer job with a young investigator at the time who was studying dendritic cells, which was something nobody had ever heard of because he had discovered them. This was 1976 and Ralph Steinman, who was my mentor then in my mentor now discover dendritic cells in 1971 or 72.

Speaker 1:          02:01          The first publications were Njm, the Journal of experimental medicine in 1973. So I came into the lab and he had one technician and he was at the bench and I was free labor. So he was in his now rather frugal. And I learned to work in laboratory with him, which was wonderful because shortly after that, probably two years after that, he stopped doing benchwork himself and he was remarkable in that he'd made an observation that other people didn't believe and he had the ability and the tenacity to stick with that observation. People thought that the, the primary antigen presenting cell in the body or the cell that would show other cells anything foreign, which is what an antigen is, was the macrophage. And Ralph had discovered dendritic cells in cultures of macrophages and dendritic cells are really potent. You only need like one or are literally, you need like literally 100. And so when he saw something, nobody else believed him. But Dr Cohen, who was his mentor did and they were tenacious and stuck with it.
