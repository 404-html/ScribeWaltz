Speaker 1:          00:09          If we don't heed the lessons of the 1970s, which were bad lessons and the lessons be early part of this decade, um, then, uh, we will find ourselves in trouble. Um, and that is no matter what happens during a period like this, it is critical to preserve the quality of life. The schools have to continue to improve. Crime cannot go up, and ideally it has to go down. The parks have to remain clean and well maintained. Our cultural institutions need to be supported. Housing stock has to be maintained and people have to be able to afford to live here where you maintain the quality of life. Yes, we will all suffer somewhat during a period of like this. I think the mayor is the single best person in the world to manage through a crisis like this because he's very good at finding ways of doing more with less and understands fundamentally that what this all is about is maintaining and enhancing that quality of life so that when the recovery does occur, we haven't set ourselves back so far. They will spend decades trying to dig ourselves out of the hole.
