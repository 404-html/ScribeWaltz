Speaker 1:          00:08          No. Well

Speaker 1:          00:11          it depends on what you describe as big media is Google big media now. I mean they're worth more than most of the other media companies. There was a period of time when most of the cable companies, they were worth more, at least in Wall Street market cap terms and then the broadcast networks. It seems in media that no one ever really goes away. It's when something new comes out eventually, first of all, people say, Oh, you know, TV's going to kill radio and then cable TV is going to kill tv and you know this or that, or the other thing is going to always kill something off. Somehow everybody moves over on the bench and nothing really goes away. I mean some formats might go away like the eight track or the cassette or the LP, but the idea pretty much continues and in the end, the big media companies, which facial lot of challenges now, I mean you're talking about the traditional TV, cable TV companies, they, they face a lot of challenges from the new media.

Speaker 1:          01:11          They will eventually morph into that world, be bought by a new media company by one, and turn will still find ways to participate. It's going to be hard. I think it's naive to think that these companies are going to crumble and fall away. I mean, they're going through a very tough transition now as our people in any industry that has to deal with the digitization of anything. But at the end of the day, there'll be a bunch of large companies, pretty much controlling a good amount of what goes on. That seems to be, you know, the way of our capitalist system. That's not to say that the small independent voices still won't be out there and be able to be heard, but, but the mass market, as it as however you wanna define it, uh, will be reachable largely, probably through bigger.
