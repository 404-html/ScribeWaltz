Speaker 1:          00:00          Many people come to me and they see how courageous they see me. And very often, uh, maybe in shocking way I said, but I don't find myself courageous. I, I find myself passionate and I love what I do. And if I love what I do, I'm going to do it all day long. And if I do it all day long, I probably will be very good at it soon.
