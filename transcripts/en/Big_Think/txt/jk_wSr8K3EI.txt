Speaker 1:          00:00          In Our world view, excellence equals design times, culture. So half the battle is getting the design of the organization right. And um, these are things like, you know, choosing very strategically where to excel and we're to underperform and that that's a design function and you have to make sure that the business model works and then it can scale. And then it's systematically setting people up to perform. The other half is, is culture. And you know, one of the reasons that culture matters so much in service organizations is that we need our employees to, um, every day on the front lines make decisions that are, that end up defining the customer experience in managing those employees. The handbook only gets you so far, you know, you, and part of that is because customers are wildly, wonderfully unpredictable. You don't know on the front lines and the service organization, what's going to happen moment to moment and culture tells you what to do where, um, when there isn't a policy or precedent.

Speaker 1:          01:01          And so it's a, it's a hugely important asset in service organizations. So Southwest Airlines, the reason we love it is that it's an, it's in perhaps the worst industry of all time. So the industry has essentially destroyed more value than it's created since its inception. And then there's southwest who's profitable every year, every year for one decade, every year for another decade, every year for another decade. They do it by this beautiful elegance of focus. They are very comfortable saying, we do this, we don't do that. Which means they have great strategy and they're very great at delivering excellence because they say, we'll do these things well, turnaround time, being on time. We'll do these things badly. Go on board of Southwest Airlines flight and ask someone for a full meal. They have no shame, no apology. They might mock you a little bit in their reply. They understand what they're optimized to be great at.

Speaker 1:          01:54          They understand what they have to give up in order to deliver on that. And they understand it from the top of the organization all the way down to the bottom. One of the things that southwest does in a training experience is, um, they get everyone, all the new recruits in a room, and they have everyone stand up and share their most embarrassing moment. So people in the moment think this is pretty hardcore. I mean, they're, they're testing us for poise and our ability to communicate in a stressful situation. And it turns out southwest isn't looking at the speaker. They're looking at everyone else and they're looking for signs of empathy. And so when they see signs of empathy in that crowd, those are the people that they ended up hiring. So it's, you know, it's a great example of a distinct clarity on the values that are important to them and figuring out how to find them, uh, in the hiring. Yeah. Process excellence is designed times culture. You have to get the design right and you have to get the culture right. Great design. Bad Culture won't work. Great culture, bad design won't work. We need both. In southwest is just a magnificent illustration of both.
