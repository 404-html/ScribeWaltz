Speaker 1:          00:10          David blaine's plan was to spend 44 days in a see through plexiglass box dangling from a crane near London bridge subsisting on nothing but water. He called the endeavor above the below, which some observers considered a bit much. The British were not impressed. They were not impressed when Blaine pronounces venture at the most extreme exercise in isolation and physical deprivation ever attempted or when he said, I'm a great artist. Nothing more, nothing less. There were not impressed by the multimillion pound deal. He struck with Sky Television and there were not impressed that he had decided to confine himself to glass prison and voluntarily starve when so many people were actually incarcerated in real prisons and actually starving. The mayor of London said it was disrespectful to the IRA members who died on hunger strikes in the 1980s Blaine duly took his place in his box, but the stunt totally backfired.

Speaker 1:          01:03          This is if it were the 18th century and Blaine was in the stocks. Crowns of cynical lenders gathered underneath his box and laughed at him. They pelted him with bananas, French fries and eggs. They made such a mess and his girlfriend, the unusually named German model, Manon van Gherkin, had to be cranked up on a crane to wash the food to try this off the box with a cloth. We never had anything like this in New York. She said, Blaine's helpers raise the box so it would not be within egg throwing distance. A group of men position themselves on tower bridge and tried to hit it with golf balls. A hamburger van pulled up below and began ostentatiously frying onions and other foods is enticing. Aroma was designed to upset, blame, starving as he was a man tried to cut off as water supply. Some youth frightened him by shining, lasered bends into his eyes.

Speaker 1:          01:53          A homeless person sat nearby behind a sign saying, please give generously. I'm attempting 44 days on continuous alcohol abuse. Women took off their tops and flash their breasts at Blaine. Men pull down their pants and mooned him. People stayed up all night playing the drums so this to disturb the tranquility of anyone who might be trying to sleep in an overhead box or radio station or just listeners to stand in the cold chanting, Ding, Ding, Ding, and then I'm noxious fashion. Someone blasted the song living in a box by the British pop funk group living in a box, a remote control helicopter buzz by dangling a juicy looking cheeseburger on a string. There was unpleasant speculation about Blaine's bathroom arrangements in keeping with Britain's wellknown lavatory obsessions. Blaine's explanation of his plans for his liquid waste that it would be expelled by a to bleeding out of the box had left a solid waste situation.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Deliberately vague adult diapers were mentioned or radio host took to calling Blaine nathey man. Newspaper columnist speculated that the illusionist had been eating on the sly saying that they actually kind of fat considering in the Sun. Jane were referred to him. Is that total twerp currently dangling in a glass box above the Thames in the Guardian, Catherine Bennett said that the satirical response to Blaine illustrated the temperamental gulf between Britain and America because Britain's know how to tell the difference between a huckster and a hero. She urge Londoners to engage in a mass public ridicule by taunting blend with food, even a blob of oily ice cream tastes wizard when consumed in this suspended company of the posture as close starving Blaine, she said, true. He did have a supporters including American tourists, regular visitors who believed they had telepathic communication with him and that he was sending them special signals from the box.

Speaker 1:          03:42          People who felt sorry for him and the parent normalist Uri Geller, who announced he is the quality of respite. And when Blaine finally came down thin and weak and with his major organs on the verge of collapse or so, he said the general feeling was that above the below had been beyond the absurd, a huge pretentious failure. But what was it that made ordinary Britain's teas and resent him so much? Because he was making such a big deal about it because he had revealed himself to be a puffed up self promoter rather than the friendly kind of eccentric who does what he does for himself rather than for public acclaim, news capable of going to the pub and laughing at himself over a few pints because he did not know when enough was it.
