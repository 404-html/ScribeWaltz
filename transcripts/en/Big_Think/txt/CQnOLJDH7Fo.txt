Speaker 1:          00:05          The system.

Speaker 2:          00:08          It's under strain. And we're seeing manifestation of that is and the rise of the independent voter registration. I think the political system, if you look at here in Washington from the governing standpoint, it's clearly broken. We're at gridlock on every issue. We fail to address issues of irresponsible spending or Medicare, social security, and we don't do any of the hard things. Um, we spend, we're in a continuous battle over the war in Iraq and, uh, partisanship and bitterness is probably as high level as I've seen it in all my years here, that we sit down together for the good of the country. I know how to work across cio with Democrats. So I have for many years as president, I will reach across my hand, across the aisle to the Democrats, and I'll ask them to reach across to me and I'll ask the American people to urge him to do so. If we get things accomplished, then obvious him all the credit.
