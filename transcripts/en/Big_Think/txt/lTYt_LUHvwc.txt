Speaker 1:          00:05          We have a responsibility as a professional,

Speaker 2:          00:12          the timeline of the professional, what's happening in the profession, who has made a contribution and learn from those things to free yourself to become your own voice. When I was building this house in North Sea, which were making the documentary of, and I work with Peter Shelton, my partner and my dear friend from college read Morrison, I realized there's the building went up. I could kind of see the intellectual collage of who I was as pieces of the building stood at various stages. I could feel the ghost of Loucon. When I looked at the poured concrete, when I saw some of the glass details, I kept thinking of the architects collaborative in Boston. When I looked at some of the woodworking on the cladding, I thought of Ed Barnes or Cert, and then the way the stair was conceived, I thought of court was the a and I started to realize that pieces of who we are are often pieces of who we've looked and studied, but it's our responsibility to then become ourselves.

Speaker 2:          01:31          So how do you take that where you can almost dissect your own psyche and the layers of building is such an interesting tapestry of those pieces of who you are and then hopefully when they come together they become you, but you owe to who you've become. And then I realized when that building was done, because I love the archeology of great people in my profession, meaning whether it's their drawings, their furniture, their lighting that kind of designed democracy emerged, which is such an American idea that we embrace many cultures and we celebrate them and we celebrate ideas. So the building was a kind of international amalgam of people and things that as Americans, we're very open to and that I had actually collected the archeology of those people. And as those things occupied the building, I realized that there archeology informed the building that they inhabit.
