Speaker 1:          00:03          All I have to say as I hope there is such a thing as clean coal. And the reason I say that, uh, and of course that means that we can burn coal and completely capture the co two and then cause sequestered. And it's certainly not an easy thing to do. But what I keep reminding people as a kol is the world's most abundant energy resources. Now you can argue whether it's as abundant as solar or wind, but certainly in terms of conventional resources and what people forget is that coal employees, literally tens of thousands of people around the world, not only in our own country, but in places like India and China. It is cheap. And so it's very difficult for emerging market countries that are trying to electrify to, uh, the grow their economies. Uh, economically it's very difficult for them to simply say, well, we're going to stop using coal because of concerns about climate change because not only will they throw thousands of people out of work, but they will not then, and probably in the near term, have a readily available alternative, uh, to replace the coal generated electricity.

Speaker 1:          01:08          That's leading to these explosive, uh, levels of economic growth. So I hope that we put a lot of research and development. Uh, uh, there are essentially three major ways that we think about right now to, uh, to potentially have clean call. One involves taking the coo to help me for combustion and to capturing it after combustion. But I would like to see us cooperate with the other big coal users and Indonesia and China, India, and maybe jointly embark on some research and development projects using these three technologies. And, uh, not see it as a commercial gain of one country is going to learn how to do it, not other, but, but Santa, the rubric of the global good that we all do it together. And then your share the benefits accordingly.
