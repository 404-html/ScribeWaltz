Speaker 1:          00:12          And I don't really worry about to listen to what they think, but it seems to make a living.

Speaker 2:          00:24          Transcendental meditation is one particular

Speaker 1:          00:26          form of mantra meditation, and there are many that allows your mind to experience progressively abstract fields of awareness and ultimately just settled out in the space between your thoughts. The space between your thoughts is pure consciousness. And uh, it's a field of possibilities is a field of creativity. It's a field of correlation. It's also feel the one certainty and it's also a field where intention actualizes it's own fulfillment. So that meditation allows you to contact this field which is very primordial the ground state of our existence

Speaker 2:          01:15          according to our current understanding of it, king

Speaker 1:          01:17          of the universe. The physical universe is actually made up of energy and information. Wherever there are objects, there are fields of energy and also have inflammation. And if you go to the very fundamental levels of activity in nature, you find that nature is a discontinuity. Which means even though our perceptual experience of the universe is that it's continuous, in fact, it's going on and off at the speed of light. We know what's in the honor of the universe. It's energy and information and we use it in our technology when we use cell phones yourself, the information highway on the internet or cell or send each other email, but the deeper question is what in the half, what's between the two aunts in the discontinuity and many people in quantum physics in the world of quantum physics or realizing or thinking or hypothesizing that the discontinuity is consciousness itself.

Speaker 1:          02:24          That consciousness is not a byproduct of evolution as has been suggested or for that matter. An expression of our brains or the itch expresses itself through our brains. That consciousness is the common ground of existence that ultimately differentiate into space, time, energy, information and matter, and the same consciousness is responsible for our thoughts, for our emotions and feelings, for our behaviors, for our personal relationships, for a social interactions, for the environments that we find ourselves in and for our biology. In other words, consciousness is the ground of being the differentiates into everything that we call reality, including the observer and the objects of observation. And this is a much deeper understanding of consciousness that is coming about as a result of some insights from the world of quantum physics. Not everyone agrees on this theory. In fact, a number of scientists are still tied to the old paradigm, which is that matter is the essential reality and that consciousness is the epi phenomenon.

Speaker 1:          03:46          But it turns out that, um, even to explain simple things, how do you perceive color? How do you imagine? How do you see pictures in consciousness? The sounds in consciousness? You have to recognize that this can not be explained by any reductionist model. When you experience a sound or a color or a taste or a smell, the activity in your brain is just a quarter of charges that goes on and off. How does that code of charges going on and off become physical reality? And where does that happen? Uh, if we understand this model of quantum physics, then it becomes apparent that, uh, we're not in the physical world. The physical world is in us. We create the physical world and the when we perceive it, when we observe it, and also we create it's experienced in our imagination and when I say we, I don't mean the physical body or the brain, but that deeper domain of consciousness which conceives governance constructs and actually becomes everything that we call physical reality. This is a model that is being explored by some cutting edge scientists both in the field of neuroscience and also in the field of quantum physics, but it is also a model that was explored by the great sages and seers, some of whom were the authors of the Bhagavad Gita itself.

Speaker 1:          05:18          My medical training was in the field of internal medicine and then in the field of endocrinology and neuroendocrinology neuroendocrinology. The study of brain chemicals and brain chemicals are the mechanics through which our thoughts express ourselves. So when you have a thought or feeling or an emotion or an idea, you make have a specific chemical. It's called neuropeptide, and these neuropeptides are messenger molecules that then go to the rest of the body and influence the activity of the immune system. And actually almost every biological activity in the body, so your body, which is very physical, is under the influence of your thoughts, your feelings, your emotions, your dreams, your fantasies, your desires, your instincts, your drives, your imagination. All these things orchestrate themselves. All these internal activities that occur in the invisible domain that we call consciousness actually have very precise physical effects both in our biology, but they also influence our perception of the world.

Speaker 1:          06:31          Um, over the years I've looked at the biological markers of aging, and these include things like blood pressure, bone density, body temperature regulation, um, skin thickness, the number of wrinkles, immune function, sex hormone levels. I'm hearing vision. There are a number of ways you can measure what we call biological aging. Then there's something called chronological aging, which is a direct reflection of when you were born, the date you were born, and then there's psychological age, which is how a young you feel psychologically. And there is more and more data that the biological markers of aging are more under the influence of psychological factors. Then the chronological age that we usually associate with. Of course, there are other things that influence our aging process, including how we perceive time. If you're constantly running out of time, then your biological clock speeds up when you do run out of time with a heart attack or something like that.

Speaker 1:          07:43          Um, the quality of our self esteem determined, so we age our perception of our bodies, uh, as fields of energy or as fields of matter influence how our body ages, and there are many other things, the quality of our rest as in sleep or the quality of our ability to manage stress as through meditation, physical exercise, mind, body coordination, through techniques such as yoga and breathing and martial arts. Um, the quality of our relationships, whether we have toxic relationships or healing relationships, the quality of our emotions, toxic emotions or emotions that, uh, uh, foster connectivity, these all influence how we age aging is subject to revision. So you're going to have somebody who's chronologically 80 but could be biologically 65. On the other hand, you can have somebody who's chronologically 25 and they're physically and mentally burned out of their biological age. Maybe much older are the fastest growing segment of the population in the world right now is over the age of 90 and in some cases or the age of 100 and some countries, so people are living longer and even though much of it as attribute it to modern medicine, it's not. It's lifestyle, it's nutrition is the quality of exercise, the ability to manage stress and some of the factors that have made

Speaker 2:          09:26          sure.

Speaker 1:          09:30          I think everybody has a role in their own aging. Some people accelerated, some people a slow it down, some people manage to reverse it. It all depends on how much you are invested in the hypnosis of social conditioning, so if you believe that it's certain age, you have to retire and become dysfunctional than you will. What I do is mostly creativity. I think a creativities and the static impulse that we all have and there's nothing more joyful than having a moment of creative insight and then actually creating a or rather manifesting or incarnating your creative insight into actual physical reality. The struggle is part of the creative process and it's very enjoyable to have to struggle without the struggle. There will be no joy and creativity. The one thing that is not enjoyable is that if you get attached to the outcome and if you're constantly looking for approval and you are not immune to criticism, then you are in trouble and you'll continue to be struggling and never find the creativity

Speaker 1:          11:04          run through. All my work are that consciousness is the ultimate reality, and that by understanding consciousness, you understand everything about yourself, about perception, about creativity, about behavior, about relationships. So by understanding God's justice, you have the ability to create anything in your world and you have the ability to influence also the collective consciousness to not only bring about personal healing, but social transformation and ultimately healing our planet, which happens to me extremely wounded. So in the upanishads, in which includes the Bhagavad Gita, they say no, that one thing, by knowing which everything else is not, and that one thing is fine.
