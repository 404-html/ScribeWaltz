Speaker 1:          00:07          I don't think it's had a dramatic effect. I think one of the effects, which is not probably a great effect, is that a lot of the new shows now try to show that they have a sense of humor and uh, and um, um, that, that they can be rascals as well or make fun of themselves. And I'm, uh, I'm not sure how I, I, I'm, I'm not sure how valuable that is. I think probably their anchors on these shows are less likely to say things without thinking if, if they're concerned that they might be made fun of on a show like the daily show. So that can't be bad. I don't think it's made the gun gun shy in a way that the, that the audience isn't being served. I mean, um, you know, um, I think, um, I think, I think that the, the, the sad reality remains that they are, that they respond to what they think their audience wants. And this current campaign is so riveting that they're sort of on their best behavior right now. And I actually think that the, that, the, that, the, that the cable news nats, which are sort of flawed because they feel that they need to keep filling all this time least it's being filled with, with more substantive politics than usual.
