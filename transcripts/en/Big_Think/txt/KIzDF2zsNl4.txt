Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah, the inward, the short answer is that my could not stand the inward, had no use for it in the context of its use, did not matter to her. Her thing was very simply that if I have a vial, a with a cross bones and skulls on it and the word p o l I s o n written on the bottle. It's poisoned. If I take that same poison and pour it into the most beautiful vase of baccarat crystal ever made, it's still a poison for her. The context of the use of the word and didn't matter. Now this was a generational thing because my was 30 some years older than I am a or was at the time of us having this conversation and my view of the inward has a bit more nuanced. A, again, based upon the generation that I've been raised in and the music that I listened to in the culture that I've been a part of.

Speaker 1:          00:52          So my view is a little bit more liberal than my view on the inward. And so we had this debate for years about whether or not, you know, the inward was something that ought to be used in any context. And we never agreed on that. There are a number of things we never agreed on. She asked me when I was in Africa, what I thought the greatest virtue was of all the virtues tab is, which is the greatest virtue for you. And I said, I think love is the greatest of all the virtues. And she said, uh, I think courage. I said, really? She said, yeah. So for 28 years of our friendship we debated, which is the greatest virtue, love or courage. Her argument was that it takes courage to love it. My argument was, but, but, but, but, but love is courage enacted a, I believe that love is the greatest of all the virtue.

Speaker 1:          01:41          She thought it was courage and we never, we never settled that debate. So there are a number of things that we would come back to time and time again over the course of our relationship. And we had different opinions. The point of this is that she allowed me to interrogate her. She allowed me to disagree. She welcomed my opinion. She wanted to hear what I thought on a particular issue, even if she thought I was wrong. We had debates about the merits of art versus entertainment and what makes something art, what makes something entertainment. So we had these debates all the time, but it was. It was such a beautiful relationship where we were always allowed to engage each other and no matter what the conversation was, no matter how tense or terse it might've been about a particular subject matter. Every conversation always, always, always ended on a love note. She never allowed the conversation to end without it being on a low note.
