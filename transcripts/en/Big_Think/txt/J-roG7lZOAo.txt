Speaker 1:          00:08          I think of what happened, yes.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Today or just recently on fit with facebook where they've, you know, developed a way to capitalize on the fact that people are sharing information with you know, 50 million people and other people who are of a like mind and they're going to attach at advertising to these messages. And I think you have to be really careful that the advertising doesn't become so intrusive that it, it, it's greeted in a hostile environment. I remember many years ago, like the 10 or 15 years ago, there was an idea to put advertising on the, um, on the, on the runways where the baggage was being the baggage runways and airports so that while you were standing there, oh, wondering if your baggage was actually going to come through the door. You could be looking at advertising on the, on the rubber, on the rubber strips. And I don't know if that was ever done.

Speaker 2:          01:03          I don't know if it was some APP, some airports may have actually done that. And that was an interesting idea to try and sell somebody something while they were bored or, or terrified that they'll love luggage wasn't going to show up. I don't know that that was ever done in great numbers. I certainly don't remember seeing it and the travels I've done. But you have to be careful when you surround the consumer with advertising messaging that you don't irritate them in the process. And that means that you have to be entertaining, you have to make them, you have to be appealing, you have to make them want to watch what you're saying, your messaging, you have to be a craftsman. So a lot of the user generated advertising might be interesting now and I think it's fun to think about it and, and some of it is actually pretty good. I think it's still an art form. Advertising and the creative end of advertising is still needs art artists and craftsmen and people who are good at storytelling and creating imagery and making things beautiful and interesting to watch. So I don't know that uh, the user generated commercials are going to take over there. It's kind of interesting now. I like them. I think it's fun, but there's always, it's like a mosaic, you know? There's a place for everything.
