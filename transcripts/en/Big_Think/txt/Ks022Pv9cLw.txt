Speaker 1:          00:12          Not doing anything that's substantially different. It's a lot of the same techniques you go up on Capitol Hill, you are trying to get journalists to write things that are favorable to your cause. When they don't write things favorable, you protest, um, you do the same things that the national rifle association is. You make sure that congressmen understand that if they take positions contrary to what you want, you're going to try to steer campaign contributions to the other side if at all possible. So the nature of the activities is pretty similar to what other powerful groups do as well. You know, why is social security a sacrosanct third rail issue? It's because the arp has a position of that and they can organize their members and so politician who suddenly steps up and says, you know, I think social security audit be cut is going to be in real trouble for doing it.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So at what they're doing is not all that different. They are particularly good at it, but they're not doing anything that's illegitimate with one exception, which is the tendency to smear anybody who is critical of this relationship for being antisemitic or being bigoted in some way though what happened to Jimmy Carter, for example, after he published his book Palestine piece, not a part that is a sort of classic example of this where he was accused of being a Nazi sympathizer accused of being a Jew hater, etc. Etc. And this is a prEsident who had done as much for israeli security as any american president ever has. That I think is not legitimate because it gets in the way of a free and open discourse, which is really essential in a democracy.

Speaker 1:          01:48          You could certAinly diminish the impact of all special interest groups if you could have a really radical campaign finance reform in the United States. it wouldn't end interest group politics, but it would take some of the fuel out of it and that I don't think is going to happen in my lifetime because of course that would get resisted by all special interest groups. not any particular one. Um, I think because there's nothing wrong with any group of americans, uh, organizing to shape american foreign policy in ways that they think are good for the country. Uh, I don't favor putting any restrictions or limits or saying that you guys can organize. You can't come up on capital hill anymore and talk to congressmen. I think anything like that would be very anti american, very anti-democratic. What I hope happens, and I hope our book it helps encourage is that some of the organizations in a sort of broad coalition, which doesn't agree on everything by the way, that some of the more moderate groups and more progressive become more influential, gain more supporters. Um, and similarly, some of the more powerful groups now thAt tend to be more hardline begin to rethink their positions. I would have no objection to there being a very powerful pro Israel community in the United States if I thought the policies they were pushing for were better for us and better for Israel as well. Um, so I have no problem with there being the lobby. I just wish it were pushing for policies that were smarter.
