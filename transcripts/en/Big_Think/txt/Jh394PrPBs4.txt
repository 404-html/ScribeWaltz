Speaker 1:          00:07          Oh, well that's a long story. So, um, I was in retailing, I went to city college and I went to fit and I was in retailing for awhile and I was working for a company called gimbals in New York City and they were going to close shop. They sold the real estate here right here on 33rd and Broadway and I was out of a job. So I said, Oh, you know, I've always been, well I've been working since I'm 16 years old. I said I was married at the time and I was able to take some time off. So I took some time off and some friends of mindset to me, let's open a cabaret. And I said, oh, that might be fun. So we opened this cabaret on Eighth Avenue and 26th street and they named a caroline's. Well, once my name was on the door, then I had a little more than invested interest in it. So I said, Oh, this might be fun, you know, helping run this club. So we started with lots of cabaret acts and when that quite, it really didn't hit me. I mean, it wasn't contemporary enough for me at that time. Then we started to book comedians like Jay Leno and Jerry Seinfeld and Garry shandling and billy crystal and peewee Herman. And that was the start of, of Caroline's as a comedy club.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:20          watching the David Letterman show that was on it, you know, 12, 30 at night. Uh, Jay Leno was kind of a regular on that show. So I kind of Said, Oh, let me tie it into one if we can get him on the show when he said Caroline's and he can mention that he's there and then people come out to see him. It was a way of, of saving with advertising, but getting the word out, I guess it was called marketing at that time, so kind of we did it that way and I kind of built our reputation. He was a working comedian. He worked around the country. He had a small following at that time, but they came out to him and it was kind of my contemporaries at the time. Jay and I are, you know, like the same age and his clientele was the same age as that time and, and they came out to Sam, followed by people that were on the rise like Jerry Seinfeld and Garry shandling, Sandra Bernhard, Rita rudner. I mean, it's everybody that's kind of made it, came through the club I think. Um, I think I was talking to an agent at that time at Apa and Jerry was there and he said, well, you know, agents are always trying to sell you a so talent. Anyway, so he suggested that we, we booked Jerry and we did A. Jerry worked at the club for a number of years and I remember him doing a few new year's eves there. So it was Kinda fun years ago.

Speaker 1:          02:47          I think a lot of people came through our system, you know, we, there were a lot of people where we had them as we, we put them as opening acts. I mean, Chris, Chris Rock was a young kid when he started to work at the club. Um, and when he last appeared at a club, we had a, a young comedian called Wanda Sykes and Wanda, we put wander as an opening act and introduced to the Chris and after that, you know, she kind of, her career was made and she worked. She worked a lot with Chris with Chris Rock. Maybe I take it for granted. The people have come through there. I mean lots of producers. Larry David and Michael Patrick King, Jon Stewart, Jon Stewart who was a writer on a TV show that I had for a and a for six years. So it was also him and Michael Patrick King. I mean, when I look back at some of the fun things that we did, you know, when the early nineties, you can see where these guys were headed to, after that. Um, we, we start a lot of people at. There's a young woman, Lisa Lampanelli, we, we let her come in and let her perform there and build her following. And she went on to do not to be very funny lady. So things like that.

Speaker 1:          03:58          Um, I think how I watch Comedians, I've watched them grow Sunday night. I was watching the Oscars and I watched John Stewart and I was thinking last night I wanted to send them a note, you know, I remember him as a 27 year old kid standing with me at a bar at the club that I had at the seaport, you know, talking about his mother to me and um, you know, just to go back into, to see how he's grown over the years. It's just quite amazing. That's almost 20 years ago when I, when I met John, you know, I did a Kiddie show with John at the sea port on a Saturday morning. I wish I had the tapes of that right now. He's grown, he's grown. He's, you know, he's, he's, he has his own voice. He grew into himself. Um, he's, he's just a real, real big, big

Speaker 2:          04:46          hello.
