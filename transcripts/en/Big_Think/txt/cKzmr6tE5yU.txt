Speaker 1:          00:00          We are seeing now climate impacts that are tremendously costly in tremendously challenging in EPA. His role is to try to make turn that challenge into a positive message moving forward, give communities the tools they need to adapt, you know, recognize that the time for action is now. So in many ways the the problem that we had in the past was twofold. People didn't see the impacts as as, as much as they're seeing them and feeling them today. It wasn't already. It's happening. What do I do? And so we were predicting things that might happen, but it's taken so long to take action. Those predictions are already here and frankly we never predicted the kind of impacts that we are seeing today. Climate is always portrayed on newscasts as being some kind of big debate. You know, the big debate among the scientists is that 97 percent of them know it's happening and I really worried about it.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Three percent are skeptical. That's not a balance. That's an overwhelming majority in that needs to drive the decision, especially in a democracy. That's how we work. We're working really hard with faith leaders in this country because many of the people listened to their faith. Lead is for direction in the faith. Leaders are extremely concerned that climate change is an issue which most importantly more significantly impacts low income and minority communities. The least of these are going to be the most impacted in a changing climate, so we are moving with with an ecumenical, a constituency in the faith community to bring this message to their constituents and it's extremely important to recognize your own limitations about who, who you're good at talking to and who's going to believe you and who the people you're trying to influence listened to because we can talk all we want about the science at EPA, but you need to put that into people's homes and ears in a way that they're going to listen, absorb, and know they can be part of the.

Speaker 1:          02:06          The solutions moving forward that gets them off the diamond builds a constituencies you need to succeed in something that is really as big as this. The challenge of climate change is enormous for us, and so you need to attack that from all different angles and make sure to get everybody engaged. I don't need to fight the climate deniers now. That's not what I think we need. The rallying cry needs to be. What actions do we take that are going to address climate, both from, you know, we need to mitigate and make sure that we're reducing those impacts, but also let's do it in a way that grows a low carbon economy. Let's make the United States flourish because we stood up to this problem and we took action.
