Speaker 1:          00:04          Well, I mean, I think that's always sort of the fun part about the story about deal stories is that they often have this almost movie like quality to them where they're meeting in secret hotel rooms and there have project code words and you have teams of people, oftentimes hundreds of people who are under this kind of a cone of silence and you know, how they make a deal happen or not. Oftentimes there's not just two people coming together in a friendly way. There's multiple bidders. Someone is the jilted lover who doesn't get their, uh, it doesn't get the bride. And so there really is a great story here, but you know, you asked how do these deals really come together? I think in one way, in every situation somebody is looking for an opportunity. Everyone in the deal world is an opportunist, so they're looking at the stock price. They're looking at the relationship between the CEO and the board. They're looking at whether the CEO is about to be ousted and maybe there's an opportunity to come in then and there. They're looking for weakness, frankly, oftentimes. And, you know, all of that collectively is, is, is the great soap opera that makes my job so much

Speaker 2:          01:07          fun.

Speaker 1:          01:14          You know, what, what's made this actually so interesting is that the deal landscape, if you will, the players, uh, and the importance of the relative importance of each player has changed dramatically in the past, say 12 or 18 months or 12 months ago. The most important people on the planet were these people called private equity, which is sort of a misnomer for what would otherwise, or a polite way to describe Lbo is or, or leveraged buyouts, which is sort of a less polite word that people didn't like in the eighties. But you know, whether it was Henry Kravis or Steve Schwarzman from blackstone or the guys at tpg or Carlyle in Washington, these guys with the power players, they were the hitters because they had amassed all this money and we're spending it at, at outrigger outrageous songs at an outrageous pace. And you saw some very big blue chip companies, uh, get taken out, get bought in these massive buyouts.

Speaker 1:          02:09          Um, you know, now that we've had this credit crunch, a, they still have cash, but they can't, they can't add the steroids, right? They can't add the juice that makes their formula work and therefore they're sort of sidelined and now you're seeing big corporations big what they call strategic players come in and start making deals. They had sort of been cast aside because they couldn't afford to pay the premiums that private equity was paying. And frankly, it's unclear where the private equity should've been paying those premiums to begin with. We'll see how those deals work out. But you know, now, you know, in the news there's rumors about Inbev, the beer distributor in beer manufacturer trying to buy budweiser, for example, a anheuser busch. That is. And so, you know, that's a big strategic deal, uh, that about a year ago probably wouldn't have happened. So you're seeing sort of major corporations, I think that had sort of been, hadn't really been thinking about acquisitions because they didn't know how to compete against private equity. Is, is the new power player. So it's no longer a cabal of 10 or five guys from the private equity world who are going to rule the world for the next couple of years. It's really the CEO's of big corporations and the bankers and lawyers behind the scenes that are making these deals happen.

Speaker 1:          03:22          Hot Sector is always a dangerous question because, uh, it, you can never get the answer right. Just when you think it's hard. It's not, um, you know, I think right now you're going to see transactions in the financial, what they call financial services banks. Everybody needs rescue financing. You saw this, all the banks go through this period in November, December where they wrote down billions upon tens of billions of dollars and they needed more cash to keep up, to stay afloat frankly. And you saw them go, what they say go to the desert. They would, they would go to the Middle East and raise money. I think you're going to see a lot more of that over the next couple of weeks, frankly. And I think you're also going to see banks that need to consolidate and there's always been consolidation than financial services area, but I think you're gonna see more and more of that. Obviously bear stearns in trouble goes in and is now owned by JP Morgan, but you're going to see countrywide gets bought by a bank of America. These are deals that are not going to be with the calls from strength to strength. These are, these are, these are truly going to be distressed deals were some, some strong players taking over distressed player and is seeing as we talked about being an opportunistic, being an opportunist, you know, really trying to take advantage of a situation.
