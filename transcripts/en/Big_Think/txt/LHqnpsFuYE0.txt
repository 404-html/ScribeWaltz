Speaker 1:          00:10          What was the revolution, I mean did in the 19 sixties, um, it was a sense of, it was, it was really a questioning of how had this country with this commitment to democratic values justified, you know, a series of prejudices and tolerances including, um, treatments of, of women as less than fully human women couldn't have a bank account. Women couldn't have a credit card, you see, you don't remember that. And I remember teaching at Harvard, there were no women on the faculty. Um, and that all changed. That changed relationships between men and women. And the issue I was talking about before, which was for a woman to feel that what I know or what I believe or what I think or what I feel or what I want is legitimate. And it's not the only thing, but it has legitimacy of its own, was huge rather than seeing it as selfish.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Now that of course if you've been at you introduce want or desire, you introduce sexuality and you know, in the old sort of framework, women were seen as not wanting. Sex is not sexual beings. It's not having desires and thoughts of their own quota. Funny Authority on this, which is Freud who said that the so called intellectual inferiority of women was due to their needing to suppress their sexuality. Because if you couldn't think about all aspects of yourself, you had to start restricting how that you could think at all. And also I would say having to distance yourself from your body because your body was seen as somehow bad or wrong. You lost touch with your experience and then it was very easy for women to not know what they knew through experience and to be open to all kinds of.
