Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08          there are two possible ways to extend your life with action that you take today. One is to do things that allow you to maintain your health for a longer period and the other is to act to hyphen that referred so that the time when therapist come along, which can rejuvenate you and give you another leaf of life, come along in time for you. Even if you are going downhill. Those two things are additive, so to speak. They're independent criteria. Now it turns out that the first criteria, and there's not much we can do unless of course you are unusually for particular age related problem like you know some people come down with type two diabetes and the 13th no drugs for that. If you are the sort of normally healthy person who has natural lifespan is going to be her more than there is nothing to speak of that we can do that will extend your life by an appreciable amount or at least that is proven to have jobs to be able to do that.

Speaker 2:          01:08          So we have to look at number two and number two, the situation is completely different. It doesn't matter who you are, whether you're a scientist or a broadcast or a journalist or a general member of the public, it doesn't matter who you are. You can make a difference by contributing to the enthusiasm and society for this work, by changing the mood of the fatty and thereby changing the funding environment so the work will be done more quickly. Oh, I personally, for example, don't get enough sleep because I'm traveling all the time. I'm on the road. I'm trying to get this stuff to happen and from a purely health point of view, that's probably bad to me. It's probably shortening my life, but I'm pretty sure that I'm bringing forward the day when the therapist will arrive by a larger amount that I'm filling in in my life, but even in my own personal selfish turned on probably winning. And of course I'm not only doing it for selfish reasons. I'm doing it to save your life as well.
