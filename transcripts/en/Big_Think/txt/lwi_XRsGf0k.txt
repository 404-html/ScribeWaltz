Speaker 1:          00:00          We learned from a very early age to make our sense of self worth conditional upon some kind of external criteria which can be judged by others because of this, self compassionate becomes a challenge because self compassion requires a natural ability on your part to be able to deal with your failures as well as success with understanding, acceptance and kindness. The problem that I see with the self esteem movement particularly is that self esteem movement, again, you know, kind of plays into this tendency to make your sense of worth conditional upon what you achieve. Uh, and, and, and inevitably that involves comparison with others. And, and you know, there's also a moral problem there because in order to boost yourself as team, sometimes you need to put down in your mind the self compassion doesn't require any of that. What self compassion is suggesting is that you should be able to do the same thing that you normally do to someone that you can towards yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:08          And the beauty of that is that once you have that kind of ability to relate to your own situation, situation with kindness, it creates a kind of a reservoir of strength and resilience so that you have planted to draw from. Because otherwise, if your compassion has always other directed and you do not take care of your own needs and your own wellbeing, at some point, this kind of leads to compassion fatigue. And even in some cases when the relationship does not work and when there is not enough recognition from coming from the other, the recipient side, you might even feel betrayed and let down and used and ultimately even feeling bitterness. So having a greater base of self compassion really buffers against all of these potentially negative consequences of being always too much other focused.
