Speaker 1:          00:06          If there is a single force as a biologist, I would have to begin with the force of evolution. Uh, clearly, uh, I believe in evolution. I believe in the, in the theory of natural selection. I think it's had an enormous impact on who we are as a species and where we are today. Um, I believe in the power of technology. I think particularly if you look at the history of human endeavor, you could write that history based on the kinds of technological advances we know from the bronze age on the first time someone picked up a stick and realized it could be a tool, uh, to what is happening today in, with the Internet, for example. I think that has been a tremendous, tremendous, uh, force, uh, that has affected the way we have developed as a species. Um, I think the other would be the move away from subsistence to creating excess, which is another way of saying, uh, the ability to move from living hand to mouth to find the leak creating wealth than what wealth allowed individuals to do, uh, both in terms of creating a greater comfort in the way we live.

Speaker 1:          01:32          But I think also in allowing us to leisure time that allows us as humans to create art, for example.

Speaker 1:          01:43          I think the great force in higher education in the United States has been a, is really been several things actually, now that I think about it. The first I think was the commitment really from the very beginning of this country to free public education. Um, that I think was a revolutionary idea in some respects. And I think it is one that has served the country very well until relatively recent times. And I think if I have one concern about how that is now playing out today in 2007, uh, I worry about the enormous difference in the quality of the very best and the very worst of our public schools in this country. Uh, the gap between what happens in Princeton high school and what happens in the high schools in Trenton, which are just 20 miles away, are night and day. And I worry about the degree to which are striving for free public education has really been diminished in this country. Uh, I think the same thing could be true about great state universities. They, they were created a so that at every individual capable of doing work at the university level, what have an opportunity to go to college. Uh, as those state colleges and universities are being financially squeezed by their state legislatures, they have only one choice and that is to raise tuition. And as they've raised tuition, those state colleges and universities become less and less accessible to those who are in the bottom of the income bracket.
