Speaker 1:          00:09          I think the Darra certainly tensions. There are certainly some skepticisms. Um, and I think, you know, there are some young people who wish the old folks would stop talking about back in the day. Uh, but that's true of all young people when they talked to old people, right? It's not just a, a true of our community, it's true of all communities. But one thing that I think is important understanding is that there have been a, there are generations in our community, right? And thank God for that. Right? Uh, one of the things that's so tragic about the lgbt community is that we have a generation, many of whom were lost to the AIDS crisis. And so unlike a lot of communities, I think something that's very specific to our community, uh, is that, you know, we have the stonewall generation that was there, the participate in the protests that were part of that early, uh, uprising of gay liberation, uh, that are really feeling of, of liberation that came out of that movement.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Uh, and then there was a period of time where we lost a lot of our brothers and sisters, especially our brothers, uh, to the aids to aids. And there is a pain there and there are scars there that are, that will never go away, nor should they. So this idea that we're all kind of free and all this progress has been made and that the young people in this generation that are coming up now have no worries, right? The fact of matter is there are actually rising std rates and rising HIV infection rates in certain segments of this generation. A part, certainly my young men of color, young men in the African American and Latino communities there arising HIV rates among this members of this generation. Uh, there are all sorts of considerations that, and struggles that this generation has to, has to work with. And so, and, and, and the progress that's been made will, will yield its own struggles, right?

Speaker 1:          01:49          I mean, you know, it's one thing, the struggle to earn the right to marry. It's another thing to struggle to make your marriage work. Right? Then once we have the right to marry, then we're going to actually marry each other and make it work. And that's not easy, right? Nobody's ever been married, will ever tell you that. I mean, what's the biggest crisis of the, uh, the, the, the worst thing that's happened as a result of the goodrich decision in Massachusetts is that the good rich has got divorced, right? You know, and, and you know, and I, I feel badly for them, but the end of the day, like that court ruling was named after a lesbian couple that were heralded as heroines of our movement. And they should have been, they were very, very important, but they're now divorced, right? So that's its own struggle is to figure out how to make families, how to make our families work, how to marry each other and love each other and stay true to each other.

Speaker 1:          02:36          And that's, that's a human struggle, right? That's a human struggle that transcends all histories in all communities. Uh, and it's one that this generation is going to have to struggle with in a way that other generations have never had to because they didn't have the right to. But these reits also will, we'll bring out their own struggles. And I mean, I see this all the time. Uh, and, and, you know, so I think we all need to be more alert to the differences that we, uh, experience and, and, and, and, and give witness to based on where we are in history. But I think we also have to understand that, you know, we all have struggles and as a result, we are all struggling people. And that, that should be able to elicit a certain kind of empathy that can sustain us, I think, more strongly and more deeply than it than it currently does.
