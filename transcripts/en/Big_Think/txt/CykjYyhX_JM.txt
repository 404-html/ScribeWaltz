Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, I never really thought of the media was some kind of bullying. Something has changed. I mean the media now is so diverse and so complex and there's so much of it, you know, you can find problems with anything I suppose, but the fact of the matter is a lot of media today isn't targeted to me a reason to target with any person in particular. They look for certain market segments and they go for them and they really don't care anything about anybody else or what anybody else thinks. And uh, you know, professionally I was part of that process for a long time. But I do believe today if you're an active, involved, educated, thoughtful person, you can find a mix of media that appeals to you, satisfies you more readily and better than any point in time in history. So you can say, oh my God, the media, they're so exploitative. They lean towards a sensational thing or they don't have enough international news coverage. But you know, it's your decision what you want to watch. And there's just so many other options. I really have a hard time feeling sorry for anybody who has that point of view.
