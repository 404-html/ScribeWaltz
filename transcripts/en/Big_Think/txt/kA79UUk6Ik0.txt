Speaker 1:          00:04          Well, I think one of the most more surprising things, and this is something that I'm be following and blogging about it, some of the reports that have come out of the Pew Research Center, um, it in, in these analysis, they're looking at a, what exactly are people talking about at blogs and this new media ecosystem, whether it's blogs, whether it's independent media, whether it's twitter or whether it's a facebook, where is that content coming from? Uh, in, in one particular study that they looked at, they looked at the media ecosystem surrounding a Baltimore, Maryland. Uh, and in that study, what they found is roughly on average, 90 percent of the topics that were being talked about at blogs or other independent media originated with traditional news organizations in particular. Either the local newspaper, the Baltimore Sun for the national newspapers in their, in their online version. That tells me that, um, where a lot of, a lot of people claim that the traditional media is no longer relevant.

Speaker 1:          01:03          In fact, we fundamentally rely upon the traditional media, the role of the traditional journalists as an independent professional, a news gatherer to inform ourselves. And it's the fabric of what we discuss online and without the traditional, a traditional news, that traditional news gathering process, we really wouldn't have a lot of good content. I'm, uh, and we wouldn't have a lot of original reporting, uh, elsewhere. Um, uh, online. Uh, the other really interesting thing is, um, uh, more recently they looked at the major blogs and they looked at an analysis of the major blogs, public affairs related blogs, and they looked at what those blogs are discussing and where the links are going to m and a and more than 90 percent of the topics discussed in the links. We're back to the traditional media. Uh, and that's also interesting because people claim now that, uh, the blogosphere now, uh, has this ability to control the news agenda.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Well, that's not necessarily the case. The blogs are still influenced and they're still driven by what's being reported. The New York Times or on the broadcast news or on the cable news networks or political talk radio. It's that they take that content and they sometimes refocus it. They redirected, they shape that agenda to either be in a certain ideological direction, they might reframe the significance and the information that's being reported on, or they might take the agenda, the traditional media and focus in on just a few topics, uh, whether it's a foreign policy climate change or particular political scandal, you know, there's a couple couple a things to think about, uh, when, when, when you're considering a, the tendency towards self self selection itself, exposure to different topics and public knowledge. One is that, uh, going back three or four or five decades, the 19 sixties when we've asked in surveys, quiz questions about the public's knowledge of the most basic political facts or the basic facts about issues related to science or the environment.

Speaker 1:          03:18          Inevitably the public scores very low in these fundamental a quiz, a quiz like surveys about either public affairs, literacy or science literacy. Um, uh, so that hasn't changed. And in fact, what we, what we've seen over the last 15 years is that public knowledge and public scores and those types of questions remain relatively relatively stable. Um, it's a question though, whether that's the best measure of public knowledge or of, of, of civic culture. Um, uh, one of the things that we're seeing is, is actually not necessarily a decline in, in basic public knowledge, but a real problem at getting public attention and in elevating public concern about many different issues. The environment is a great example where climate change is a great example. And, and, and this is a problem really fundamentally have of choice. It's the great paradox of the age of engagement that today we have more information choices about public affairs, politics, science, health, medicine, the environment than anytime in history. Yet if you, as a consumer of information or as a member of the audience or an individual lack of preference or a motivation to engage with that a news and information on a regular basis, you can completely avoid that information. It, it's not top of mind. Um, and it's, it becomes that much more difficult than to, to really raise the type of political will necessary to get things done in this country on issues like climate change, immigration, social security, uh, healthcare. Uh, you name the public problem.
