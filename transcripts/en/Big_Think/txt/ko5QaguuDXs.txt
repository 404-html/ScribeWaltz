Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          imaging technology is a, is a wonderful enabler of disruption because in the past the doctor could only listen to find out what's going on in your heart, in your body, or they could feel and they just have to use their intuition is this normal, abnormal. They miss a lot of stuff, but from a company in Seattle called Sonos side, as well as from a spinoff of GE medical systems, there are now little handheld ultrasound machines that are very affordable for a personal care physician to buy and essentially what it is is a visual stethoscope. So instead of listening and feeling that Dr just during a physical exam, just looks inside of your body and, uh, and as a consequence, they can see things much earlier and take action mature earlier than you could if you had to wait until a tumor got big enough that you could feel at or we're experiencing the consequences.

Speaker 2:          01:17          And that brings the ability to look inside the body right to the doctor's office for much more accurate diagnosis. At much lower cost. I'm in general imaging technologies have preempted what we used to call exploratory surgery. When you couldn't look inside the body, you had to cut it open to see what's going on and now just being able to look makes it a lot more affordable and simple. Now those machines are very expensive and so you have to go take your problem to the solution, but their technology is in development now that will decentralize the ability to look inside the body like this little handheld ultrasound. The other exciting one is the advent of molecular diagnostics. Um, it turns out that the body has a very limited vocabulary, but it can draw upon when it needs to express that something has gone wrong and the body's vocabulary are, it's physical symptoms.

Speaker 2:          02:24          The problem is there just aren't nearly enough symptoms to go around for all the diseases that exist. And so the diseases had to get together and agree to share symptoms of. The problem then is when you diagnose a disease symptom and it's caused by multiple different factors, you cannot have a rules based therapy because the therapy that works for one patient who's been diagnosed with that symptomatic disease may not work for another patient. Because there are multiple causes of those symptoms and before we, we didn't understand that care could only be provided through the wisdom and the experience and intuition of highly trained doctors, but the genomics revolution has really enabled us to understand at the molecular level what these diseases truly are now. So for example, we thought there was a disease called type two diabetes diagnosed when you've got elevated levels of glucose in your blood.

Speaker 2:          03:37          Turns out that there are about 20 different diseases that agreed to share elevated blood glucose as their symptom. And so in the past you couldn't treat all type two diabetics the same way because the response was highly variable and now we understand, oh gosh, it's because diabetes isn't the disease, it's those causes that are the disease and molecular diagnosis is enabling us one by one to figure out exactly which of those you have that then is the precursor or the prerequisite to the development of a predictable therapy. Um, cancer is going through this transition in just a marvelous way. So we used to diagnose cancer and define the disease by geography. So you had brain cancer, blood cancer, bone cancer, breast cancer, and you would treat patients who were diagnosed in that way with a radiation or chemotherapy. One patient would respond and then the next patient wouldn't respond to the very same therapy and so you just had to leave it to the intuition of the best doctors you could find, but now we understand that that's not the disease.

Speaker 2:          04:57          In breast cancer, for example, there are about six different tumors, each of which can be characterized by the unique molecular pathway by which the tumor propagates and so there are six diseases there in that location. Not One, but understanding them that you've got these different types of tumors, allows you then to begin developing a therapy that is appropriate and predictably effective for that type of tumor and it turns out that each of those types of tumor doesn't. Tumors just doesn't rise only in the breast but arises elsewhere in the body as well. And so our ability to cure cancer or to put it into long term remission is much greater now than it was 10 years ago because of these molecular diagnostics. Cervical cancer now is a very well understood disease. We understand its causes, virus in care at that point when you have a an ambiguous diagnosis followed by a predictably effective therapy and nurse can actually provide that care just as well as the doctor could, and that's very exciting.
