Speaker 1:          00:02          So there, there's, there's a whole lot of them, 75 percent of medical costs stem from behavioral and cultural issues over eating, eating too much corn syrup, smoking, lack of exercise, the basics, the absolute basics are causing tremendous cost in the system and tremendous misery among the people who have these conditions, helping people understand their role in their own health, helping people move through a mental space where they actually participate in making their health better, which ends up producing costs for their companies, for their insurance companies is what we need to use this technology to do. And lots of people might respond to the ability to earn money by keeping yourself healthy. But some people might not. Some people might only respond to other motivations like losing money or social pressure or entertainment or, um, uh, being in the know, being helpful to others. If you give someone an opportunity to be helpful to others with your condition, you see their health improved dramatically for some personality types.

Speaker 1:          01:09          And our last company tickle, we had 100 million registered users. 20 billion questions answered. We had five phds on staff or on the psychology of your personality and were you working on sort of taking that, that understanding about human motivations and creating a set of experiences which address the seven or eight main motivation types which apply to seven or eight different personality types, is gonna start to deepen our ability to help people move through behavioral changes they need to make to really change their health and the costs of, of their health, of maintaining their health. And so that's, that's one of the things that we're trying to do. The, the main costs come from diabetes, heart disease, obesity and asthma and allergies. Those are the sort of main low hanging fruits. That's where if you look at where your costs are coming from, that's where they're coming from.

Speaker 1:          02:03          And you know, diabetes is an epidemic in this kind of 88 percent of people have diabetes at this point. Um, that's, that's a major cost center. So, uh, going after those diseases with these new methodologies. You know, we've tried a disease management in the past, but it's generally been only going after one personality type, which is a nurse calls you twice a week to berate you into maintaining your health. That works for some people but only works for one personality type. You need to apply many more tools to getting people to change their behavior and you need to deploy them in a much more cost effective way, which having an expensive nurse called twice a week to the whole population is pretty expensive way to do it. And, and so those are models that have failed, but there are many more models to try and some of them are going to work over the next five or 10 years.

Speaker 1:          02:50          And so that's what Med ped is as a platform for trying out all these different ideas and then capturing the stats about what's working and then iterating on that and, and focusing people on the things that are actually working, evidenced based, sort of behavioral change. Uh, and, and that's, that's where we're going. Another, another big cost center is a misdiagnosis. So in your local area, you're going to have a physician diagnose you and they may or may or not, may or may not have the uptodate information about how to diagnose someone with these sayings. It's estimated that up to upwards of 40 percent of serious cancer cases are misdiagnosed. Not that you don't have lung cancer, it's just what type of lung cancer and the stage you're at. It could be misdiagnosed, which causes you to have the wrong drugs with the wrong program for taking those drugs at the wrong treatments. And if it's 40 percent, that's an incredible cost to the person to be misdiagnosed and an incredible cost to the system to have to treat them for five or six months in the wrong way before they actually get to the proper treatment. So that's another way that Med ped can help is by processing the information, uh, more effectively, uh, and having the most up to date stuff available to everyone, including your local physician who can then tap into that knowledge base and help, uh, help that physician diagnose you properly. More often than not.
