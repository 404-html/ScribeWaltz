Speaker 1:          00:06          Dennis kucinich, I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, the oldest of seven children, and my parents never owned a home. Uh, we were renters by the time I was 17. We lived in 21 different places, including a couple of cars. Uh, that experience of growing up in the inner city, which I've outlined in a, in a book that I've just released called the courage to survive is an experience that really had an indelible imprint upon the way I look at the world and upon my soul because it, uh, it taught me compassion, what people go through to just try to make it day to day, the importance of a job of a healthcare, being able to put food on the table and clothes on kids' backs. The important of education, um, you know, these are all things that are part of people's practical aspirations and having been riveted and that experience growing up in Cleveland, I understand as someone aspiring to be president of the United States, how terribly important all of these things are for, for, for people. So I'm, I'm, my worldview is truly shaped by that experience and growing up. And I know the whole world didn't live in conditions that were near poverty and I know that. But I also know that those who do don't have many spokes persons in government.
