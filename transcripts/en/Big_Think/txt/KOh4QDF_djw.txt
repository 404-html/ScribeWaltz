Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08          democracy can mean a lot of different things, but at mit, a bomb to be a democracy, we have to have a system that involves ultimately the judgment of the people and the regular judgment worthwhile. It has to be a judgment where people after console one another, I think have a democracy to call them in democracy where people don't have a respect across their differences for the co equal people. On the other side of issues, I don't think that's democracy. Whatever it may be, and I think that whatever form you're voting is whether you have direct representation, whether you're have indirect representation with a proportional representation, what he would like by districts where they would like by winner take all, whatever it may be. Whatever your voting system is. Democracy has mainly worked, precedes the voting democracy, is that deliberation amongst citizens and involve citizens. Beliefs that what we have to think matters and should matter to each other and our ability and our comfort level with sitting and talking and also listening, trying to persuade others, but first log in to try to persuade. Awesome. Really allowed the opportunity. Really listen to what they have to say is they have dismissing it out of him. That to me is democracy. It's difficult. It's rough and tumble. It doesn't always get quick and efficient answers, but it is the only thing I think I've been really do in which people actually participate in governing themselves.
