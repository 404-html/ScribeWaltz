Speaker 1:          00:09          Tight Times is when you're tested hot, it's an, it's a moment when you can redefine and slash or sustain the definition of the firm that you've had up to now. So if you already a high commitment, high performance from a, you want to make decisions that are consistent with the path you've been on a, so you, uh, and, and if you are not a high commitment, high performance from, you want to see this as an opportunity to redefine the nature of the firm, the relationship between yourself and the employees, the nature of the, of the culture and so forth. So how do you do that? Uh, uh, you, you, you do not do that by maintaining distance between yourself and those who, who, you know, you're going to have to hurt all. So there's gotta be, there's gotta be some hurt here, uh, but some of the policies are, first of all, to try to create a, a, a, an equality of sacrifice.

Speaker 1:          01:03          So one of the, uh, one of the approaches, high commitment, high performance organizations use is to have a pay freeze or a across the board pay cut as opposed to slicing and dicing and maintaining, you know, only only certain people and laying off people you want to maintain as many of the people as you can that you may still have to let people go, but that's a last stage and if you do need to let them go, you let them go based on, uh, based on the fact that somehow their position is going to be eliminated. They, what they're doing is going to be no longer central strategically in the organization. Uh, and it's based on some measure of performance contribution. But you try to maintain as many of the employees as you can. So you take nucor steel, another high commitment high performance company which has, which was born right, they didn't need to transform.

Speaker 1:          01:57          What they've done is cut across the board. I mean the steel industry has been horrible. So they have been cutting pay by as much as 50 percent across the board and making sure that senior leaders is equality of sacrifice senior leaders to taking that 50 percent cut and more, uh, that employees understand that, uh, secondly, that you're trying to get more engagement with people around solving the firm's problems in tight times. So some of the ideas we talked about earlier, bringing people together, giving them a voice about what it is that the firm can do better both to improve productivity and performance and also make their life better. So again, duality of goals. How do we do things right for people and how do we do things right for performance, but engaging people in honest conversation. So here's what we're trying to do. First of all, tell us what we're trying to make sense.

Speaker 1:          02:51          Have you, do you have any suggestions? Uh, and then engaging them in what the firm can do differently and better. And the argument I would make is that when, if you haven't already done that, what you will learn is an awful lot of stuff you should have learned five, 10 years ago about how the firm can be improved and how productivity can be improved. But now you're engaging people in a time of need for them and the firm. And that will make it easier for you actually to engage people as opposed to harder. But all of this requires that the leaders engage directly with the people. It can't be done through announcements, it can't be done through sending your hr people out to do it. Uh, they can be assisting you, but, but you have to go out and talk to people directly. Uh, and so for example, diaries, ice cream on the west coast when they had some tough times, uh, quite a few years ago, uh, the CEO and some of the leadership team went around to every part of the organization. Talk to every employee practically about what the situation of the company was, what, what was wrong, what will, what the problem was, why they were had to make some changes. And then engage people in discussions about that.
