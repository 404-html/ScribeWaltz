Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, you are, no women had no rights when Taliban came to Afghanistan. What you don't know is Afghan women had their rights before European women even knew, but that was in American woman even knew that, uh, a very sophisticated country, uh, in that sense that women were working shoulder to shoulder with men and women, their work, nightclubs, women, no, there's picture I've seen a my mom and her friends wearing high boots, mini skirts, dancing, you know, going to work with the beautiful suits, you know, above the knee skirt, high heels. The country went like 500 years backwards. That's the part that was really extremely upsetting for African women because if you never seen independence and freedom and you'd, it doesn't hit you so hard if somebody surprises you a little bit further. But if you had complete freedom and it's come in and it's all taken from you, it is a shock that it's extremely difficult to absorb. And, uh, but it was beyond that for me when I looked at my country at that time,

Speaker 2:          01:30          we should ask about how Judas, but children want it can make an Amazon mean jail hall that I watch band wonder. I'm a probably van neise churches bottom fishing amita before me. Then they came back. Matt [inaudible], Matt cautious. Well, oh no, no. Edie formula this, oh, as I know by the hundred machine and Macarthur O'connor and John Button check, give a Holler,

Speaker 1:          02:13          uh, today, uh, slowly and slowly and Afghanistan, I mean, in Cabo I should say. And this suburbs is still very difficult, but in Cabo it's changing a little bit, but once you go to a shock like that, a lot of, um, uh, media asked me a lot about, you know, well, are you working on getting the burgers off their women? And my answer to that is the last thing that an Afghan woman is thinking about right now is the, she have a burqa on or off. She's worried about her life, about her safety, about her family's safety. She's poverty is in the highest level right now. She just cares about building a fire, making some rice and feeding her family. Uh, the priority of having her Burka offer on is not on top of her agenda. Uh, what we need to do for women in Afghanistan is education, education, education, so they can stand up for themselves.

Speaker 1:          03:14          And when I'm in Afghanistan, I, I've never worn a burka. My mother never worn a burka, neither my grandmother. So it's not something I've ever seen before. I shot the movie, I made a statement about it. I just refuse to dress like that. A, I want it to be one person has to start, you know, be the example of saying it's okay, you know, oh, look at me. Okay. So I have, I have a little scarf sometimes was on, sometimes was off. I wasn't so paying attention to it, covering my face and all that all the time. And um, yes, I got some looks, but I didn't care about it. I just said, you know, deal with it. I'm not going to do it.
