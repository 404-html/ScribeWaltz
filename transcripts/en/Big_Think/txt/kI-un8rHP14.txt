Speaker 1:          00:05          So I think what's really fascinating is that there have been a number of recent studies looking at brain structural differences between liberals and conservatives and what's been found in several studies is that liberals tend to have a larger anterior cingulate gyrus. That is an area that is responsible for taking in new information and that impact of the new information on decision making or choices. Conservatives tended on the whole to have a larger right Amygdala, the Amygdala being a deeper brain structure. That process is more info, um, emotional information, specifically fear based information. So the, it's really responsible for the flight or fright response. And this isn't everybody. It's not black and white. And of course then you know, what about all of the people in the middle. But basically the study showed that if you just based it on brain structural size difference, you could predict who would be a conservative and who would be a liberal with a frequency of 71 point six percent, 71 point six percent is a pretty high ability to predict who is a conservative and who was a liberal.

Speaker 1:          01:22          Just from brain structure. When you look at what your parents were in terms of predicting what you might be in terms of conservative versus liberal, that enabled you to predict in studies at a rate of 69 point five percent, so very close, not quite as good. And why is that interesting? It's because the brain is plastic. So the question as to whether you have a brain structure to start with that informs whether you will be a liberal or conservative or whether the formation of certain thoughts from your parents, for example, shapes your brain structure because the brain is plastic and ever changing, particularly in youth. So does thinking certain thoughts or predominantly let's say utilizing your right Amygdala versus your anterior cingulate gyrus inform, uh, the growth of those areas and therefore help you predict later who is liberal and who is conservative. So in terms of interpreting the meaning of a different sides, structures for a liberal versus a conservative, I think you have to look at what that area is predominantly responsible for.

Speaker 1:          02:38          So for instance, for conservatives, if you're right, Amygdala is in large and that's the fear processing area. You would expect, um, maybe choices or decisions or character and personality to be more informed by a response to a fearful situation. So for example, conservatives, in fact in personality studies do tend to rate higher in areas of stability. Loyalty, I'm not liking change being more religiously, um, uh, involved in terms of decision making, having that, that rate higher for them in making certain choices. And if you look at liberals from a personality character standpoint, you're going to find stronger ratings in terms of liking change. I'm wanting to actually base decision making on new information, on science information. And so those differences are not surprising in light of these brain structural differences. Being a liberal or being a conservative really is not a black and white. It's really a bell shaped curve where you know, someone who considers themselves conservative, maybe far less conservative, so to speak, than someone else who still calls themselves a conservative.

Speaker 1:          04:02          And that bell shaped curve continues all the way through where in the middle of there may be a large group that calls themselves independence. What we don't know is whether that has to do with differences in brain structure. Um, and so would we see in independence. No one's done that study to say, Oh, independence, don't show any differences in brain structure, um, or any differences and say, um, risk taking reaction. So we don't, we don't know for sure what that means, but I think it's fair to say that even when we looked at differences in brain structure with the reliability of 71 point six percent, that still leaves a very large number that don't fit into that category. So, you know, where do they fall out? Are they more likely to be independence in their mind? We don't know the answer to that. But certainly, you know, these are not hard and fast rules.

Speaker 1:          05:00          This is not diagnostic science. And um, and people who are independent obviously have certain characteristics I'll say, of both sides are somewhere just like they sound in the middle. I think by understanding what's going on structurally in the brain and functionally in the brain, we can better understand what informs people's very strong opinions, um, that ultimately inform her political system, right? Because it's one person, one vote, and in trying to change people's minds, I think everybody has to look at what's behind the ability to change your mind, you know, is it really changeable when, when we look at, um, voting and, and changing minds and say, political advertising, you have to recognize that all of that new information always comes in through the prism of your brain, which means that what I say to you versus you have maybe heard differently even though I've said the same thing, so it comes in through the prism of, does what you said make me nervous and afraid and therefore I'm going to resort to my old standby.

Speaker 1:          06:19          I don't want to change my decision or am I going to hear the same information and say, oh, that's novel. I have a receptivity to novel information. Therefore, that's interesting to me and I'm going to think about whether I might change my mind based on that. New Information, I think that's what the science is basically saying to us that there are going to be some people who are going to hear the information and retreat to their original thinking and other people who are going to hear new information and say that really does change my mind if we're trying to have a society that will work in its own best interests. Let's say that we do want to be able to communicate with one another. And so if you're a liberal and say you want to talk to a conservative about gay marriage, you want to have in your mind and how it might still speak to loyalty, stability and religious belief in some way that you want to have those ideas in form your communication as opposed to simply saying, but you know, this percentage of the population is homosexual and therefore, you know, we should consider whether everybody should have those same rights.

Speaker 1:          07:36          And you know, science shows, it's not a choice. It's, it's simply a fact your gay or not gay. Um, and therefore, shouldn't those people have the same rights? That's not the best way to appeal. Perhaps to a conservative on this issue, you want to appeal to them in terms of how, for example, a marital rules or history might be maintained and not really altered for those who are in let's say, a traditional marriage of how it won't interrupt the fabric for, for example, of their lives, of the rules that they adhere to. Those kinds of things would be more appealing to them. Whether or not that might be the most appealing argument to you as a liberal. The truth is a conservative is more likely to be able to appeal to a liberal using novel new information that is science based and showing certain facts and allowing for it not necessarily to be purely religiously based, um, that not be the rule system.

Speaker 1:          08:42          So to speak, by being empathically understanding. And by that I don't mean sympathetically understanding. I mean truly being able to stand in the other person's shoes and have some insight into where their brain is directing them and appealing to that argument. So if you are conservative, you will want to appeal with new information because liberals are more novelty seeking potentially. And um, and often science-based is a good way to present new information. Part of what's difficult, um, in terms of what I'm seeing now is that actually people are tending to double down on their own style and what appeals to their own group of thinkers and that is increasingly preventing the kind of communication that would be important to our future so that we can't so to speak cross the aisle because it would require trying on for size, the thought pattern of the other group.

Speaker 1:          09:47          It would be saying, you know, Oh, you know, I see, and that's hard to do. I literally say that is difficult to do. So if you're a, migdal is screaming at you, you know, run for the hills or you know, double down and fight. It's hard to say, well, let me take a step back, um, and not have a fear based reaction, but instead present the science or present the new information. A good example would be that of gun ownership. If I speak about gun ownership to a liberal group, they automatically have thoughts probably about, particularly if they are in an urban area, crime and danger. Because statistically that is what they have been privy to, the information has been given to them about how many homicides are committed, who is, you know, dying by gun violence, et Cetera. If I speak about gun ownership to a conservative group, they are more likely in their loyal, stable way to think about a sportsmanship, hunting with family, particularly again, if they're in a rural area, because that is what they grew up with.

Speaker 1:          11:06          That is what has been stable for them. That is the memory that they have about guns. And so you can see how that's coming from two completely different directions, perhaps the same word gun, and that it is hard to stand in the shoes for, for example, of the, of the other group. Um, so that you can, you can come to make decisions about it. So for example, the CDC has been prevented from doing any research so that we could have new science about gun violence as a public health issue. Uh, by actually the conservative political group has said, you know, you can't do research on this area. We won't call it a public health issue. And therefore, um, you're, you're prevented from getting dollars and prevented from having research into gun violence per se, and that comes probably from a fear position that if there is any new information that sways a opinion, um, we will lose our loyal standing to something that we firmly believe in and, um, and harks back to very pleasurable, comforting memories from earlier life. So it's very complicated in a certain kind of way. Um, you know, the liberal group is wanting there to be this research, not necessarily to take guns away, but to say we'd like to see the science to validate whether or not certain things about guns or good for us or not good for us.

Speaker 1:          12:55          The most recent study looking at what is going on in the brain in terms of politics predicted with the greatest value, being able to identify a conservative versus a liberal 82 point six percent. And this was a look at brain activity, which is different. You put someone in a functional Mri which is different than just taking a picture. It picks up activity in a certain area of the brain and found that when you have them do a risky behavior and look at their activity in their brain, conservatives were more likely to light up in the fright and flight response area. The amygdala and liberals were more likely to light up in areas that have to do with social awareness. Again, you could see how therefore this difference would inform what comes to the mind of either a liberal or conservative while either involved in a risky behavior or even something that's happening external to them, but feels like it might impact them in a risky way. And that was actually even more predictive than looking at structure of the brain or what your parents were in terms of liberal versus conservative.
