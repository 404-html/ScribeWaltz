Speaker 1:          00:05          Everything worth doing in life, learn to ride a bike, learning to walk. When I was a kid, learning to walk, I fell and cracked my skull, but I needed to learn to walk, taking a test, getting married, getting a driver's license. All of those things, they give you an improved capability or an improved richness in life, but they all come with a degree of risk that is exaggerated. If the thing that you want to do is fly a rocket ship, rocket ships are dangerous there. It's a controlled explosion. If you drew a cartoon of a rocket, what it would be? Would it be a bomb with six seats on the top? I mean, rocket ships are crazy dangerous on the first flight of the space shuttle. When Bob Crippen and John Young, we're sitting there back in 1981 and they blast it off out of Florida. Now that we go back and we look at what the actual history of the space shuttle was, their odds of dying that day in the first eight and a half minutes were one in nine.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Terrible odds. One in nine. I mean, look around you and had 10 people and realize that just to try that one and nine times they would have died. They got away with it and we learned a lot from it, but even when I flew on my first shuttle flight on the 74th shuttle flight, we'd learned enough things. We'd improved it, but the odds of dying that day for my crew were still one in 38, which is no insurance company would be happy with. It's hard to get life insurance as an astronaut actually. But. But the question you really need to ask that is, do I want to learn to walk? Do I want to ride this bike? Do I want to get married? Do I want to learn to drive a car? What risks are worth taking in my life? Because even if you decide, okay, I'm going to take no risk, I'm going to stay at home and hide under my pillow.

Speaker 1:          01:51          There's still risk with that and you're still gonna die eventually anyway. So it's kind of a measure of what was worth doing in your life and therefore what was worth taking a risk for. Once you've got that behind you and said, okay, I'm going to be an astronaut, I'm going to fly a rocket ship. That's a risk I'm going to take now. It changes your whole job. Your job is not to be afraid. Your job is not to be, uh, an incompetent nervous passenger. Your job now is to defeat the risk. Like when you learn to ride a bike, if you just stay as a passenger in the bike, you're never gonna know what to do with the handlebars and you're never going to master riding a bike. And once you can ride a bike, you know you've got a freedom you never had before and rocket ships or just the same.

Speaker 1:          02:39          You have to decide what risks are worth taking and then start changing who you are, learning how to turn the handlebars so that you could make this thing do something that otherwise might hurt you or kill you. And then once you've got that done, it can take you to places and give you a richness in your life that you never would have had access any other way. And, and in my case, when you make it through that launch, when you've guided that rocket up through the atmosphere and the engine shut off, suddenly you're in the rarest of human experiences. You're weightless and the world is pouring by at five miles a second, and you can see across an entire continent and, and your, your piering into something that is brand new for humanity. So, uh, I think it's worth asking yourself what risks are worth taking. And once you've decided to take them, then change who you are so that you can, when you can defeat, you can master that thing and open a door for yourself that otherwise was just shut.
