Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, I think that, um, you know, there was a phase in human life that I hope is getting over with where, um, leaders wanted to do the social engineering where the idea of communism, not the original idea of communism, but the idea of Lenin Ism and Stalin Ism was the state should control what you are like state was more important than the people and should form what the people are. And a, that has been a devastating hold approach. It was the basis of nazi-ism its basis of communism. It's the basis, uh, Islamic fundamentalism. And it's the opposite basis as our founding founders and not just our finders, but going back to, you know, air saddle, uh, and that human beings have these attributes and we should allow the flowering of human being and the state is there to serve us. We're not there to serve the state. And that's a very big deal. And a, it's a very big fundamental difference. Whether first words of the constitution, we, the people, the United States. Now in these other philosophies, it's we, the state or the state does. And then the people, they form the people, they make the people. But that's a very debilitating philosophy. So that's generally what has been the most important political fight in, uh, last century.
