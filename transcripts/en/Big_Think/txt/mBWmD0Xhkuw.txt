Speaker 1:          00:11          Well, it seems as if there's a really big switch between about five and six. And of course it's funny because in our culture we say we talk about that age group is preschoolers versus school aged children. Of course school is a very recent invention. But if you look across lots of cultures, something happens around you know, around six. So the babies say, uh, we'll move from the mother's quarters to the children's quarters or they babies used to, uh, kids used to start becoming apprentice being being apprentices when they were about seven. And you know, sort of losing your first tooth seems to be a big marker of this transition. And I think what happens is that that kind of transition, and of course it's, you know, starting at four or five and then continuing is really a transition from a creature that's mostly designed to do this very broad based learning to a creature that's starting to develop the specific skills that are going to be important as an adult.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So by the time you get to a seven, eight, nine year olds, they can actually work. I mean they can actually do things that can actually do things that are productive and helpful. Um, and they're starting to get those narrow, more narrow, uh, maybe I think to say it's not just more narrow but more specialized. So in some cultures, our culture really values are very, very narrow focus of attention. That's what we teach kids to do in school. In other cultures what they'll do is teach kids to do things like shift attention from one thing to another very easily. The, yeah. Um, the important thing is that in all cultures you go from this early very, very wide ranging attention, which is like infants to, and here's the attentional strategy that is important to do. The things that you need to do in, in this culture. And sometimes it can be the narrow focus that we have in, in our culture, but other cultures, as I say it might be if you're a hunter for instance, it might be how to pay attention to lots of different things at once in order to hunt more effectively.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Show me how they can, you know, what can we do to make them do it better? Um, and I'm afraid, I think the answer to it is pretty boring, which is a, have lots of caregivers around who loved them a lot and have lots of stuff around for them to play with and let them play without worrying too much about whether they're getting academic skills or they're making a mass. One of the things I say is from an evolutionary point of view, probably the ideal rich environment for a baby has, includes more mud, livestock and relatives than most of us could tolerate, uh, nowadays. But I think, you know, some pigs, some, a lot of dirt and a bunch of uncles and cousins, that's probably pretty good environment for babies to grow up and, but if you can't manage that, then a lot of cardboard boxes, you know, being plants, goldfish, um, the kinds of things you see in fact sandboxes, the kind of things you see and really great.

Speaker 1:          02:59          But I, you know, when I say that it sounds very boring and banal, but here's, is one important thing. We know from the science, it's the thing that kids learn from most is other people and particularly other people who are dedicated to taking care of them. And in most places and times in human history, babies have had not just one person, but lots of people around who were really paying attention to them around dedicated to them, care to them. We're related to them. Um, uh, and I think the big shift in our culture is the isolation in which many children are growing up. So in fuck, if we really wanted to make babies smarter, what we would do is make sure that 20% of them aren't growing up in poverty. Make sure that even middle class parents aren't so insane because they're working so hard that they can't spend time with their kids. Make sure that preschool workers are actually paid more than dog catchers. So the thing that's most important is having people who are involved and engaged with the kids and also are not stressed and can be involved with them. And that's actually not boring and Banal. That actually takes a lot of work to make that happen. And it's not something that our society does very well
