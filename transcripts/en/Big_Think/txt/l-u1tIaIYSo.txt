Uh, Geez, I, I really do tend, I have made lots and lots of mistakes, but I tend to erase them, uh, as, as from my, from my, uh, uh, a mind, uh, you know, I mean, every day I make a mistake as I try to write a piece of fiction or is I try to write a story. Uh, and, and on a larger sense, I make mistakes thinking that, uh, oh, I've done this kind of thing. Therefore of course I can do this roughly similar adjacent thing. I mean, it's the mistakes of Hubris I suppose. Uh, but I, you know, it's to me, to my mind, it's better to make those mistakes and saying, man, now maybe I can't, you know, a tap dance, even though I, you know, can tell jokes, uh, it's better to make those mistakes in the attempt to, to live the amateur spirit, if you will, a then to a stick in one little silo where one has proven oneself. I mean, the, I, I think the errors of hacked them are, are more dangerous than the errors of overreach. And I've over, I've overreached I will grant.
