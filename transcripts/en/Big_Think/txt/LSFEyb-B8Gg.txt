Speaker 1:          00:00          Right,

Speaker 1:          00:10          there is already a lot of collaboration going on between a European countries and China and, uh, between us and China, and this is necessary from so many different perspectives. Um, China is part of the WTO. It is the major, you know, economy gradually will be, and it's a sustainable development and climate area. It is essential for the global future. So no doubt there has to be collaboration and China is going to develop. They are, they have ambitions and uh, we have to realize that those ambitions are not different from the ambitions that, uh, the dominated in our own countries when our countries were being developed, uh, and new technologies were being put into a function. Uh, so the best thing we can do is to be collaborative and a secret that the patterns that are used are inspired by future technologies. And it will benefit all of us.

Speaker 1:          01:25          I, you know, this, uh, being so afraid about competitiveness, I have never understood, even as a prime minister. I mean, unless you have products or services to sell to others outside your own country, then you better look for, uh, other things that you can do better. We live in a, in a world where we all benefit from doing what we are best at doing and, and use our minds and our efforts to promote a development pattern that benefits all of us. So this year, this drama about being so scared about everybody else, I have never really taken onboard.
