Speaker 1:          00:10          Gosh, if I answer this like completely honest, like it's just going to be like some Corny Shit, you know, it's going to be like, um, I, I'm sincerely interested, um, and how the mind works and in these, um, kind of universal, timeless curiosities that man has always had. Essentially, why are we here? What are we doing? What's this all about? I'm really kind of depressing curiosities that, um, for me have been answered, um, through, um, exploring psychedelics. So, and you know, you can decide if you want to edit all this however it went. But I grow my own mushrooms and develop relationships with a lot of different plants in order to find some kind of insight and answers

Speaker 1:          01:29          to those curiosities about why we're here and what's this all about. And I don't do drugs recreationally at all and I don't, you know, just trip out and enjoy the world here. What I do is go in to my own mind as deeply as possible to find answers and then come back and I know what to do. And I know that sounds incredibly corny, but that's the answer. Um, and that's why, um, for instance, I'm trying to create, work that up. Yeah. That reflects that psychedelic experience through kind of the fractal based, um, construction of the picture plane. And, um, one of the things I've learned is to, um, create my own world and share that with as many people as possible, you know, understand what makes me unique and then share that and inspire others. So maybe answer is inspired, you know, the desire to inspire others inspires, inspires me. Yeah. You know, the, the aesthetics are almost kind of the, uh, you know, a, a superficial reflection of the experience or experiences. Um, they are, to some degree that aesthetic Trojan horse, um, you know, the kind of psychedelic colors and compositions. Um, I, um, I think are, are, are, are beautiful, but that's not the real message. That's not the real content. That's just the, the form, you know, that's just the, the, the, the beauty that brings you in, I think.

Speaker 2:          03:56          Yeah.
