Speaker 1:          00:03          That's a very important question because you have to learn to love whatever you do like in the failures as much as the successes because they'll probably be a lot more failures than successes. And so that's a very important lesson to learn early on. And I learned it early in my career because my phd really got off to a pretty poor star and so there's a long period of time where I had to say, is this worth it? And uh, many of my friends were just sort of saying like, you know, you're already accepted into medical school, why do you even need this? And I think I was just really like the, the puzzle that I was sort of trying to figure out what is a compelling enough to me that I kept going with it. So I think in science you have to be very patient and you have to enjoy like the process and it's nice to think about where the process will take you.

Speaker 1:          00:45          But it's important to enjoy like each aspect of the process itself. Um, and so I think that we're lucky because we're in a time right now that there are so many tools available that there are many discoveries being made, so um, you know, there's just many opportunities to advance the field and it's coming from all directions, so that's a lucky time, but obviously there will be droughts where we figured we've kind of tapped the genome to its full potential and looking for the next thing and the difficulties with each aspect of changing paradigms. So they'll, there will be periods have already experienced some, maybe not like the biggest I could experience, but it definitely experienced long periods of failed work. Um, and I just, I still enjoy it. I just enjoy the day to day and that's important to do, like teaching. I love teaching. Yeah, love. That's one of the reasons why I didn't look at. I looked at being in an undergraduate campus because I really enjoy teaching. I think it's, I think it's wonderful and you're very lucky to be with such. I mean all students are really exciting, but it's really lucky to be with such motivated students. It's, you know, it's an easy job, so it's, it's really up to you. Um, you know, if the students are engaged, it's something you have to think about. How do you engage them.
