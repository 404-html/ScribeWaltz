Speaker 1:          00:05          Hi there, I'm Jason Guts and you're listening to think again, a big thing podcast.

Speaker 1:          00:14          Since 2008 big thing has been bringing you big ideas in small concentrated doses from some of the most creative thinkers and doers around on. Think again, we take ourselves out of our comfort zone, surprising my guests and me, your host with unexpected conversation starters from our interview archives, ideas that we didn't necessarily come here prepared to discuss. I'm very, very happy to be here today with William Shatner, the William Shatner. He created the role of Captain James, t dot kirk on the original star Trek and won two Emmy's and the Golden Globe for his portrayal of denny crane on the practice in Boston legal. He's also written nearly 30 bestselling books of fiction and nonfiction and released to awesome albums of music with the artists, ben folds and others, including Henry Rollins, who's been on this show and his newest book, zero g coauthored with Jeff Rovin is a science fiction terrorism thriller set in the Year Twenty 50.

Speaker 1:          01:13          It begins with an unnaturally powerful tsunami that destroys most of the coast of Japan and follows FBI field agent Samuel Lord, as he attempts to unravel the mystery. Welcome to think again, William. That was a long introduction, but very, very well done. Thank you very much. I want to talk about your book, but before we do that, as I am a longtime Shakespeare Fan, and I know you started out in Shakespeare, I wanted to come out of left field and ask you whether you have a favorite character, play, speech, etc. Of shakespeare, any, any favorite thing of shakespeare. I wOndered if we could Start there. Favorite shakespeare character, character play speech moment. Anything?

Speaker 2:          01:56          Yes. I have to point at a henry, the fifth in which I understudied. Christopher plummer, who was playing henry fifth at stratford many, many years ago, and in repertory is especially this repertory. At stratford you open a play and then the next morning after you've opened, you start rehearsals on new play and then you do that for four weeks and then open that and maybe a third and a fourth so that the understudy rehearsals would be delayed until you finished opening new plays. And about the third or fourth day I waS asked to go on stage as they understood it because chris was ill for a moment and they asked me to go on and I had never, not only had, I never rehearsed it, I'd never said the words out loud, but I had been drilling myself for some reason and I speculate about this and my one man show. Why did I drill those words so, so emphatically? Because nobody ever goes on for an under say no. I've never been in an understudy. A relationship where somebody went on for me or I went on for somebody else except in this one instance in which I had never spoken the words out loud. And then I went on stage in front of 2,500 people in and critics and all that. And uh,

Speaker 1:          03:14          so how did it feel? Was it terrifying? How did it

Speaker 2:          03:17          no know I was on a wave. I, I don't recall being terrified. I recall I've looked at pictures of laird hamilton coming down to a way that a 70 foot wave and I've got to think that he had the same feeling. And so I did this, this thing pursuing you and your writing and you can't lose your confidence because the moment you doubt your, it's over.

Speaker 1:          03:43          So it. So that's how, that's how it is For you. You feel that you must, you must keep self doubt completely at bay because I've often thought that, uh, you know, for me anyway, you can feel the self doubt and then say, oh, well, you know, there that is and still do your thing, you know, and just having a

Speaker 2:          04:02          that's good. If you can say, oh well there'S no doubt there's fear and there is a dread and there, oh look at that. There's hysteria coming monday. And then, you know, somehow deal with it and press on. For me in life, denial is perfect. Denied. Denied the experience. Denial. Oh, that hasn't happened. Is not going to happen, I don't even want to think about it and I'll die before. Uh, I experienced that and eventually it all goes away anyway,

Speaker 1:          04:33          so I'm half jewish and so for all the semi or fully. But go ahead, jason, you should be in denial about that. Well, I was going say that woody allen gave us all permission to sort of recognize the terror and the anxiety and simply to move forward and turn it into something I don't know if not sexy, at least acceptable in his case. Turn it into a career. Yeah. So you've had an amazingly varied career. You're your best known to the general public probably for the star trek films, but you've been doing a million things and, and you've been writing for years and years now. How did writing enter the picture for you were, you know, at what point did you decide to start taking writing seriously, if that's the right way to put it?

Speaker 2:          05:16          Well, uh, I, uh, the written word is where everything begins and ends. I've always known that. So I've always written in one manner or another. I love poetry. I love the usage of words, uh, in fact, when I was just starting out, I wrote some television, half our players, which the canadian broadcasting corporation, the cbc in Canada, which was the equivalent of say nbc here bought and I cast one of those shows a girl and eventually married her. She becAme the mother of my children, so I've been writing a long time, but the breath more measured and works started when there was a strike by some unions while I was making a film. And there was nothing I could do. I had to sit around and wait for the strike to be over. So I started writing. I gave myself the premise of a policeman in space. I had done a police series. So, uh, I began at 10 books and uh, it became 10 books a year, a year series and a movie.

Speaker 1:          06:25          So I noticed, I saw, you know, looking through your work. And by the way, I really love those, those albums that you did with ben folds there. They're really cool.

Speaker 2:          06:34          That album was called, has been. It was. I really look at that.

Speaker 1:          06:39          Wonderful. And um, I, I, I'm just noticing that in both the writing and in the music, you're collaborating and you seem to enjoy collaborating. I mean acting is the collaborative art as well. Do you find that you prefer to create with other people as opposed to a in solitude?

Speaker 2:          06:55          So science fiction is, it's a strange form Your imagining a plot and people, but it's also littered with scientific possibilities. EIther imaginative possibilities are possibilities that exist in the laboratory that may come into existence years from now and you have to be acquainted with all that. And it's a very esoteric acquaintanceship to know science intimately to be able to write about it. No science individually. Jeff rovin is tHis wonderful writer who has that knowledge. So doing the two of us, me working on the more emotional aspects and the plot and him working on the scientific aspects. We've created a lovely novel filled with scientific possibilities. Both that takes the plot along or that are added like little diamonds that that you'll read and may even smile at the new political unions that couldn't possibly be right in our year, but 50 years might very well come to be. That sort of thing is great fun.

Speaker 1:          08:03          What are so in the new buck in zero g? I mean I think I gave enough of an overview of the plot. I don't want to give too much away. It's definitely a fun and interesting thriller set. In 2025, what are some of your favorite moments or ideas in the book? Anything you'd want to kind of highlight for people who haven't read it?

Speaker 2:          08:26          Well, we have a character there. We took from the present day publiCity about people who feel they've been born in the wrong body, so we named that character ed zilla and adzilla instead of going for an operation, a changing his or her sex is able to do it by. We'll that's totally an imaginative concept taken from the ongoing controversies that are in our day and age, but someday in the future there'll be a medical implant whereby by an act of will you can change your sex.

Speaker 1:          09:03          Yeah, I found that really fascinating. First of all, adzilla his parents, uh, I guess genetically altered her either at birth or pre-birth. Um, and so that raises some interesting ethical issues. You know, like about w w we are going to come to a point no doubt in the near future when parents actually may have some stuff

Speaker 2:          09:25          control, I think with enough instrumentation that could look into that aspect of, uh, of an unborn baby. So since we're on the verge and in fact did not on the verge, we're genetically altering, but we're on the verge of genetically altering almost anything easily. Why wouldn't it be possible to go inside even just a concept and alter the genetic structure of the unborn child? It is happening when they see diseases that are abnormal or why couldn't you do almost anything?

Speaker 1:          10:01          Well, let me ask you this, were, you know, if you were in a position to sort of start all over and have kids and you had sort of unlimited genetic alteration power, what would you take advantage of it? Or what would the limitS be for you personally?

Speaker 2:          10:18          Well, you see what you're addressing. there is a real moral problem. How much do you altered genetically? That goes for food as well. By the way, gmos are apparently healthy. They're allowing us to feed 7 billion people that shouldn't be on earth in the first place by being able to feed seven and maybe 10 to 11 billion people in the very near future. We like lemmings have destroyed our environment and we're only going to destroy it further. So we've genetically altered crops to avoid disease. So the limitation is not only on what food is, but how many people we can procreate and chinese tried to do it by limiting it to one person, but that didn't work because now their culture, uh, didn't want girls. They wanted boys and saw a whole human aspect to something that was going to be really good. A scientific breakthrough that offered to humanity the hope of feeding everybody and having no, no starvation morphs into more people and more pollution and a the end of the world, the end of the world is nigh because of the number of people on earth. And how do you reduce the number of people on earth without getting into mass murder, are altering the baby in vitro did not being able to have any children. I mean the morality that that this brings up is the springboard for so many science fiction novels and that's what we're. That's what I'm. I'm

Speaker 1:          11:53          indeed. Well, and you're in zero g there is that we used to science station on the moon. There are, you know, fairly complex space station. So I mean that, you know, at least elon musk with his, you know, space x, mars, mars, mission, mission seems to think that that may be one viable solution as well.

Speaker 2:          12:14          There was no way that human beings can colonize anyplace else other than than earth because the time it takes to reach an earth like planet that has the proximity to its star and many of the values here, which includes this thin skin of atmosphere and the temperature range on the oxygen, the oxygen proportion came about by evolution. When chlorophyl stArted, I mean you go back, one thing bringS on another so that by evolving here on earth, we human beings have arrived at our reptilian brain and our complex forehead that evolved over millions of years. How the heck you can't live underground on mars, even if you could, you can't. That's we, we belong in sunlight. And that sunlight is thousands of years in the future. Even if you could go at a rocketship near the speed of light, which you can, it's going to take thousands of years. We have forgotten.

Speaker 2:          13:19          We've got things on the books, laws on the books, uh, understandings with other nations on the books 50 years ago that we've forgotten what they were and why you mill. Oh, that's right. We made a, an agreement 50 years ago. We forgotten in 50 years what that agreement was or what we were supposed to do, or imagine going a thousand years on a, on a voyage and somebody's saying 500 years from now, why are we here? What are we, where are we going on cheese? I forgotten what the, let's look back in the library and dusting off 500 years old. That's right. We're on our way to send us a what, why, why are we going there?

Speaker 1:          13:54          Maybe let's turn around. Maybe if they can figure out where I'm hold travel and get us to some exoplanets in, you know, 10 minutes, then we'll be in that situation. But. Exactly. And, and that's theoretically possible as well. Maybe. Yeah. I mean stephen hawking seems to think so. But uh, so. Okay. I think that brings us to the second part of the show where we watch these short surprise interview clips. I don't know what they are. I've not seen them. So I want to, you know, we're going to have a genuinely spontaneous conversation. The first one, which is by ryan holiday, who's an entrepreneur and author

Speaker 2:          14:32          so but with magician were thought provoking. Is that what the idea is?

Speaker 1:          14:36          Ideally it is thought provoking and if it's not then it's my job to provoke. We'll make it fun. Yeah, exactly. okay, so we'll both watch and then afterward we'll talk.

Speaker 3:          14:51          There's

Speaker 1:          14:52          a wonderful bill walsh quote about ego. He says, no ego is when self confidence becomes arrogance. Self assertiveness becomes reckless abandon and so forth. You say, he's saying it's, it's sort of past the point of any reasonable utility, right? Confidence is great. Arrogance is not great, or cyril connolly's and ego like cancer is sort of an over assertion of cells and that sort of. what I see ego is it's, it's great to believe in yourself. The problem is when your belief in yourself is not based on anything real, and so that's the enemy of, of trying to do basically anything that requires interacting with other people. Right? If you're a creative and you're not able to take feedback because your ego is either so strong or you're not able to take feedback because you don't care what anyone thinks, your work's not going to get any better. If you don't care about your audience, you don't understand who they are and what's going on in their life because you lack empathy, which is another symptom of ego. Your work is going to suffer. You can't work with other people because you're. You have to be. You're selfish. You have to be the center of attention of all times. You're not going to have a team around you, so it basically makes anything that we're trying to do harder than it already is.

Speaker 4:          16:02          Mm.

Speaker 1:          16:06          I guess I wanted to. I wanted to get at, you know, the old phrase, fake it till you make it right, and I don't know whether that advice rings true to you, but the idea that at a certain point in your career, like when you're starting out and you're doing a bunch of new things and you're stretching yourself outside of your comfort zone, as you kind of said earlier, you have to be sort of in denial, push down any doubt and just kind of in a way bluster forward perhaps. But he's, he's saying that that's kind of a dangerous state of affairs. I mean the, uh, if I'm, if I'm reading that right.

Speaker 2:          16:38          Well, let me first of all, correct. What's not correct but to what I said about denial. I was half joking about denial, but indeed as a performer and I was talking specifically about being on stage and stage fright and all those, the unknowns or a, uh, I'm a pilot for example. And I remember when I soloed in a cessna and I was making a turn by myself for the first time, the shadow of the windshield crossed my face. And I looked up with a great start thinking something was coming at me with just the shadow of the windshield. I was so afraid of what I was doing. I was up at the year 1500 feet. I didn't know what I was doing. Now if you panic, god knows what'll happen. So you need like a test pilot to control that panic and like an athlete and a big game, use it so that you.

Speaker 2:          17:31          You extend your, your faculties to, to their limit, right? Some people can do it by combining the use of those nerves. Some people say, I'm not going to even face those nerves. I'm going to focus on what it is I have to do and suppress anything else. Both work I think. But if you talk about ego, then what this gentleman is describing, ego and and trying to do something somebody else has never done or that you've never done. He starts off with ego and the need for the self confidence and the feeling that I can do it. But then he paints a picture of somebody who was so egotistical that he doesn't listen to anybody else like at a you. Hey, watch your ego because you're about to step off the precedent. So you might say, oh, well, that's where the precipice is. You can still be filled with ego.

Speaker 2:          18:23          I've got the, I've got the kite in my hands and I'm going to step off the precipice there. Just point me to where the precipice is if you don't mind, and I've got the ego that I will sell this kite in space, uh, but just to help me with the help they get to the precipice. You can have the ego and overwhelming over weaning ego. what, what, what kind of a mind would get in a spaceship and go to mars for the first time? Who would do that? Except somebody who thought, I don't care if I live or die, I'm going to make this adventure. The reAlity of the columbus sailing a ship over the edge of the earth. The reality is that he knew the earth was curved or he heard the earth was covered, but there were many of us crew who thought the earth was flat. You sell long enough, you fall over the edge. They were on the edge of a precipice. They thought, or certainly columbus thought, screw it. I'm going forward and I'm taking the risk of all these other people's lives because I think we're gonna. find the spices

Speaker 1:          19:26          and that. I think that's what I wanted to get at. You know what? What he said was that you know you shouldn't. You shouldn't overestimate your ability, but when you are going into the unknown, you don't know what's going to happen.

Speaker 2:          19:41          yeah, you don't even need a grand adventure. What about a relatIonship? what do you think didn't go well? I'm going to go. I'm going to ask that girl for a date, right? If you're shy, if you're basic nature is shy and you feel unworthy and she's so pretty and she's so. You think that that's above and you suppress all that and you venture out onto this flat earth of the edge of a precipice. You're going to ask for a date. Yeah, you have to suppress all those feelings of inferiority and and think, I'm, I'm okay, I'm going to do this to,

Speaker 1:          20:14          and not only that, but the fact that people, that anybody gets married, knowing as little as anybody else knows about anybody else, when at the point at which they get married, no matter how well they know each other, they don't. They don't know anything.

Speaker 2:          20:32          That's exactly right. They and I'm, I'm one of your funeral authorities who can attest to that very fact. You don't know anybody that you marry until you've been married a length of time. Yeah. Even then strange aspects revealed.

Speaker 1:          20:48          Right? And so I mean, to go into that kind of adventure which people do over and over again certainly requires, if not ego, at least some kind of suspension of disbelief. You know?

Speaker 2:          21:01          Well, see, now you're, you're in the area of suspension of disbelief that you're okay. You can do this, this is worthwhile. And your mother and father say a son, jason, don't marry that girl. Right? And you say, dad, I'm doing it right. And your dad says, all right, it's your life. Okay, don't Come to me. And uh, sometime later you ring your dad and say, dad, you were right.

Speaker 1:          21:29          May, maybe, maybe he'll be right. Maybe he won't, but you know,

Speaker 2:          21:33          maybe he'll be watching because he's got his own prejudices and he doesn't know this girl anymore than you do. So you can see how complex the picture is without painting a psychopath who says, don't talk to me, don't drive the I know everything. And I'm a. And we, we've heard some of those psychopaths. I don't talk to me. I'll fix it. Uh, I alone,

Speaker 1:          21:53          I believe I was listening to just such a psychopath two nights. Well, there you are.

Speaker 2:          21:58          And that, that I, I don't admire. But there are people whose core knowledge of something is so profound that they say, look, you don't know what I'm talking about. Whether it's higher maths or astrophysics or, or this relationship, you don't know what I know and I therefore I'm going ahead with my ego. I think I'm right and you're wrong. Those people who have been right and you were wrong. We're the people who, people who explored all those new ventures, they're the creative, productive human beings who've lived individually, isolated, individually over the generations. One or two or 10 people in a generation of made these steps into the unknown that advised against it by everybody.

Speaker 1:          22:48          Well, you hear these kinds of things like about, for example, stanley kubrick, right? Who is undeniably one of the great directors. Right? But allegedly he was just completely. He map out his entire production. Didn't want to hear from anybody. Actors were essentIally tools in his hands. Yeah. And, and, and you know, you can stand aside and you can look at that and say, okay, that's bad. Uh, or he might have learned much. It's,

Speaker 2:          23:18          but it's not that. It's a perfect example. A director of a film has the vision, right? And his vision may be, I thought a law those shoes and you need a tie. You need to tie the laces on the shoes. That's my vision. The wardrobe person as well, you know, they're, they're made so that shoe laces are untIed. I don't care. My vision is tie the shoe laces as incidental. Is that, that's the vision. Why that be eager? Sure. Why should the wardrobe mistress have a vision that supersede the director?

Speaker 1:          23:51          Yeah, and I think it's probably true also, and you've worked with many directors that people have just different styles, some are more authoritarian and, and, and always in charge of everything and some are probably like, I know that

Speaker 2:          24:05          Jason Martin collaborative to do it has to do with the vision. Yeah. A director may have a vision and every aspect like why would a painter say to you? Um, okay, yeah, go ahead and dabs of some color on my painting. It's okay. Sure. He's got the vision. He's painting the whole picture. That's what that kind of director would do. Other directors say, well, it doesn't matter. Tie the shoe. Listen, don't tell the show. I'm cutting up

Speaker 1:          24:34          above it. And that's their vision anyway, right? That's right. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          24:39          So you, it's hard to argue what Is ego and what does a psychopathic.

Speaker 1:          24:45          Right, right. Yeah. What is ego in the healthy sense of sort of knowing what you're doing and knowing why. Is there anything healthy about ego? Right? Well, yeah. I mean it seems so. I mean. Well yeah, because most people,

Speaker 2:          25:01          you know, what did the first person to say, look, we've just come out of the tree, let's head north. Right. And the evolution of mankind began. Some individuals had. That's I, you know, I'm tired of sleeping on the tree here. That's lie on the ground. It seems much more comfortable. yeah. But you'll get eaten. I think I'll be alert enough to hear the tiger.

Speaker 1:          25:23          Yeah, it's called leadership basically. It's called

Speaker 2:          25:26          leadership. That's exactly right. And how can you lead with a group of people? It's complex by fred and this guy telling us that the ego then leads you into a psychiatry is as I think,

Speaker 1:          25:39          interesting. Incorrect. Okay. Let's leave it at that assessment and let's move on since our time is, is a little limited to the next surprise video and that's nickeel go. Oh, he's an educatIon expert.

Speaker 2:          25:53          Alright.

Speaker 5:          25:59          The statistics show that bullying is a major, major problem in most american schools and what they find is that in school schools have a number of different qualities and one of them is the antidemocratic governing structure. Uh, if you look in most american high schools, for example, they are a gargantuan mammoth institutions. They have thousands upon thousands of kids, uh, walking through the hallways every day, uh, and what, what happens as a result of this, and this is not necessarily the fault of teachers or even just the people in that school building. When you have such a large student body and you don't have a, you have large class sizes. There's not enough time for students and teachers to have really strong, authentic and genuine relationships and students. Basically what happens is they don't have any relationships with fellow peers and students that are really rich and authentic level. And so when students feel that they have no power or no agency in their school experiences, what often happens is something called clicks arise. If students feel that they have to wield power and get control within themselves and within their ranks, and so clicks are one of the major phenomenons in american schools where they create basically power structures within the student body of themselves.

Speaker 1:          27:14          I actually Want to start in a sort of oblique way and then come to the bigger ideas here. I wanted to start with like, you know, let us take a trip in the wayback machine to Canada. When you were a kid where they're bullIes in your school, were you a bully? Were you bullied? Was there, was that a thing in your that you dealt with?

Speaker 2:          27:33          Uh, well, you want, you want to bring this specifically?

Speaker 1:          27:35          Yeah, why not? And bullying. I want to start. Well, I mean I just find that it's sometimes helpful to go from the particular to the general and it, and a little more colorful. I'm happy to. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          27:48          well, when I went to a grade school and maybe even as far as high school, I was brought up in montreal, Canada. Okay. And I'm jewish and uh, being jewish in the miller that I was in a, it was an unusual and so I was attacked a lot as a kid for being jewish and I had flights every day. It was more than one guy at a time and crowds of kids gathered around yelling, fight, fight, fight, and I'd be the one in the fight trying to handle one if not two and sometimes three kids my size, my age and I had fights all the time. And one bully I remember in particular who was, there were places where coal was dumped into the furnaces, so they were raised like two feet above the ground and so they provided a place, maybe four foot square that was like a crowning place. So somebody would stand on this and be the bully and then they try and get you off. That was part of the game to see you could stand on the highest place, the longest part of a bullying campaign. But that's my experience about being bullied. I was bullied all the time. Now,

Speaker 1:          29:03          I mean, just looking back, do you feel, I mean, not that anyone would wish that on their child, but did you become like tough as a result of that or was that.

Speaker 2:          29:11          Well, that's, that's an interesting aspect. You know, wish on your child is an interesting phrase. You wish only the best for your child kindness agonists, ambition, a softness, delightful pink, uh, lots of food, leonardo soft bed, good. You wish they would have that, but what does that make? Right? What kind of a child does that make? When you talk aBout bullying, it seems to me you need to look at life around you. You look at other animals living in concert with each other. Look at a wolf pack. Every social animal that I can think of. Chimpanzees as close to human beings. Apes, all the great apes in concert. When they live in concert, there's one or two alpha males or uh, in elephants. Maybe it's a matriarchal and the alpha female and they alone, at least in the wolves, they alone breed and their children are alpha children. Then they're handled. Even the insects bees. Think of it most maybe all aspects of life living together. There's a dominant individual,

Speaker 1:          30:26          but at the same time, don't we have to say that like humans, while we are like other pieces were differentiated by the fact that we have a prefrontal cortex, we organized into societies, we have the option to make decisions. We organized into societies in which there's a lead elect them or their appointed or they assuming there's, there are leaders and there are followers. Do the leaders achieve leadership by bullying that? What I'm saying is that we. We don't, it doesn't necessarily. We don't have to organize things as killer be killed, that we are different from other animals in that. For example, we, you and I are not going out every day and like ms dot shetty and people. Now there are humans that are doing that, but no, but how did you get this podcast? Well, not by machete, well, not literally, but did you push somebody aside who might've had a podcast? I mean, not, not literally, but I've just literally. But somebody could have had a job, but you got It. Right, right, right. Good point. Good point. Um, I love making a good point. No, it's, it's, it's good. So you know, going back to what he was saying in terms of power structures and how they create

Speaker 1:          31:46          bullying, I mean regardless of whether we think that this is a natural.

Speaker 2:          31:50          No, not regardless. That's the point. Okay. The point is it seems to be a natural evolvement evolution in, in a, in a group that if the group has to do something other than just sit around and go into the ocean and, and toast marshmallows by the campfire then, but then somebody brought the marshmallows and somebody made the sticks. So in every group that needs to go to do something, go someplace, there's always a leader. Let's go there now let's go. Okay, let's go seven steps in that direction. See what happens.

Speaker 1:          32:26          Yeah. I guess where I guess where I want to and you know, and we're not debating. I mean I guess where I, where I, where we are different. Well where I differ is maybe we are. Where I differ is just using the word defer differ william. We are not, it's not a zero sum game. Like we're not, nobody's keeping score, right? I, that's not, I don't, I'm not trying to win the podcast. You Are. Okay. So know what I'm saying is like leadership and bullying aren't necessarily the same thing. Are they? oh, I mean,

Speaker 2:          32:59          leadership and bullying are not the same thing. So where do you go? Where do you, where do you work? How do you mitigate all those things? So let me tell you what, what I think about that. I think we need to teach from birth on empathy. we need to teach the ability from one human being to the other to place yourself in that person's running shoes. Baby shoes, spikes writing shoes. We need to everybody to say, listen to what this person is saying and crying out for help to be listened to. Look at my experience here. Look at what you've trIed on my toes and that hurt. Let me explain to you this hurt. You've crushed my toes and that hurts and I don't want to hurt you. And norman, maybe I'm not incapable of hurting you, but listen to how I'm hurting. And maybe you don't do it again and you teach empathy to children because empathy may not be natural sympathy maybe, but empathy to live in somebody else's mind for a moment and understand completely what that other person is feeling, I think is taught and you need to teach that. And as a result of that may be aspects of bullying would dissipate.

Speaker 1:          34:28          yeah. Maybe there could be more empathetic leadership, for example, more empathetic leadership which will hopefully get after this upcoming election. Fingers crossed. We'll see. I'm william shatner. It has been great talking to you and I think we'll leave it there because we are almost out of time. And a zero g zero g is the new book. It is really, really interesting and exciting. And it's set in the 20 slash 25 slash 50 really? But no, it's all right. Just a few years difference. I'm being empathetic. Being an empathetic leader. I do it. Don't worry about it. Did I understand you made a mistake in 2025 but it's really 20 slash 50 but not to worry about it. I'm with you. Alright. And let's go test marshmallows and go to those. Thanks so much for your pleasure talking to you, jason. Pleasure talking to you.

Speaker 6:          35:25          Yeah, and
