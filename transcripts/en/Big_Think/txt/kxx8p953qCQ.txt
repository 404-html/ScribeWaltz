Speaker 1:          00:00          This president is is really establishing a tremendous legacy on the environment as as well as the economy and I don't need to speak to the economy. Let me speak to my issues. First of all, I have been engaged since day one on efforts to reduce carbon pollution. Most notably in the car industry. If you take a look at the cause of today, you have three times as many models for sale today as you had when he took office that are 30 miles a gallon per gallon or more in terms of their efficiency. That is because of actions of this administration. We are doubling fuel economy by 2025 we're doing that as a fuel economy standard and a carbon pollution standard. We have been looking at reducing toxic emissions from utilities. We actually put forward something that looks at reducing mercury and arsenic, things that we haven't been able to move forward on and the result of that is that it's already past the compliance period.

Speaker 1:          00:59          We never threatened reliability. We got some, some of those old inefficient units have gone out that didn't have modern controls. Our communities are healthier. We're saving up to 11,000 lives every year ever was. As a result of that, we have renewables when three times as much as when this, when this president came into office 10 times more solar than we've ever had and these are becoming competitive technologies. We have also have grown in the, in the building trades in terms of how you build energy efficient homes and buildings. We have grown thousands and thousands of jobs. We are building the the economy of the future by building in your considerations on environment into those decisions. We're looking at water rules today. I am actually moving forward with a final rule that is going to settle the question of what waters are important to protect so we can protect people's drinking water into the future and how do we adapt to a changing climate.

Speaker 1:          02:04          When you have California with such significant water shortages, what does that mean? How do we change the way we do business? And instead of piping water out, we're looking at green infrastructure moving in. So we have a tremendous rich legacy that this president is going to leave. And I think climate is, is really going to be the one that's most talked about. But frankly, our legacy needs to be that we're nimble enough as a government and as states working with the federal government to be able to see what the challenges are today and to position our solutions in ways that grow, uh, our ability to tackle the problems of the future.
