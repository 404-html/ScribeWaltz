Speaker 1:          00:00          No

Speaker 1:          00:08          world of acquiring work for an auction catalog is, it's quite hilarious because it's, it's definitely this insane high, low aspect to everything that we do because on one hand there is very much that kind of populist, I'm making somebody rich overnight appeal to putting together an auction, which is very addictive. Um, there's nothing greater than, you know, when the proverbial elderly lady in Rock Chester writes you and says, you know, I saw you on some, you know, Internet site. It sounds like you're, I have this piece of furniture. Is this by, you know, Carla Molino, my, my, my, my parents acquired it at a department store and 1938 in New York. And it is, and it's, so there's that aspect. We have a one off relationship with the, with the, the client that pulls the declaration of independence out of their basement. At the other time you have longterm relationships with pickers.

Speaker 1:          01:13          The guys in vans who'd go out there and find the stuff that people are not savvy enough to call us about the stuff that goes through a state sales, the stuff that ends up in foreclosure auctions. The things that get put left out by the side of the road. If you don't have a good network of, of, of dudes and vans in the postwar design business, you're finished. And you've got to maintain excellent relationships with them so that they bring the peace to you and not to your competitors. But on the other side, the high side of the coin, um, there's nothing more exciting than meeting with curators in a museum who've decided to deaccession apiece, who've decided that, um, you know, this piece isn't right for their collection and they would like to sell that piece to bring more money into create, get more pieces.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Um, in December we sold a grand piano by Gilbert Rhodey from the Museum of Modern Art's collection. And the piano had been in their auditorium and was being used by the Department of film to accompany silent movies. But as a piece, it's a piano. And even though this was an extremely rare piece by a very unsung 1930s American industrial designer, it's a piano and piano is very, very hard thing for a museum to display. So they sold it with us. And you know, nothing more exciting than, you know, having that kind of provenance. You know, when, when, when putting together a catalog and, and finally we were working with, you know, I continue to work with some of the great collectors out there and with them, well, they already know much more than I do in many of these areas. It's more a question of meeting with them and going, well, you know, what do you want to do now? What you know,

Speaker 2:          02:51          you want to sell right?
