Speaker 1:          00:09          I became involved with the conservation work and, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:15          through that, um, Dr Wilson's Biodiversity Foundation, which aren't, I'm on the board of, because it was clear to me that, uh, that, uh, mankind, human activity was degrading our earth's resources at an alarmingly rapid rate and that we were losing species, um, right and left important species perhaps. Uh, in some cases we knew in other cases we hadn't yet, um, full knowledge of a species or an organism before it was lost. It's my understanding that that much of a much of our medicine, much of our food stuff that may be required in the, in the future will come from these reserves of biodiversity, which are rapidly disappearing. Um, and unless we have a fully, um, uh, protected, uh, uh, bio, uh, systems, uh, we will not, we'll lose the potential to learn how nature works. And that information may be critical in our understanding of how to manipulate, uh, um, what is in our power to manipulate to, to save biodiversity, save, uh, the power of our, the

Speaker 1:          01:51          planet to sustain life.
