Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the things that has begun to worry me is the fact that I'm seeing change happening at a scale which was unimaginable before and that is impacting the industry after industry after industry. Every industry I've looked at, I've seen a trend of major disruption happening. Manufacturing is the most obvious does with robotics and three d printing as of this year. It is cheaper to manufacture in the United States than it is in China. It is cheaper to manufacture in Europe than it is in China. Why is that? Because of the automated robots that have two arms that have screens which show you the emotion with the sensors they have around them. I'm talking about Baxter from rethink robotics or universal. These robots have become very sophisticated. The cost of operation is less than the cost of human labor, so we can now have robots working 24 slash seven through the things that human beings did give it five years.

Speaker 1:          00:53          These robots will become ever more sophisticated. They'll be doing many, many more jobs, which means that the manufacturing industry is going to be disrupted in a very big way. The good news for America is that it's coming back here. The good news for Europe is coming back there. The good news for Asia is that it's also going to become a local industry, bad news with China because it's no longer no longer going to happen in China, so by the end of the decade, you're going to see major upheaval in manufacturing opportunities and problems move into the next decade. These men, these robots will probably go on strike because we won't need them anymore. We'll have three d printers now within 15 to 20 years, we will be able to three d print electronics. So imagine being able to design your own iphone and printed at home. That is what becomes technically feasible in the in the 15 to 20 year timeframe.

Speaker 1:          01:42          So you're talking about major disruption happening to manufacturing the short term and then even greater disruption happening in the longterm. Now look at finance. We're seeing the turmoil that bitcoin is crew guys grading. You now have many parties supporting it. Well, you also have crowdfunding shaking up the, uh, the venture capital industry that they become less relevant. We'll soon have a crowdfunding for loans that, uh, in some countries already experimenting with, with, um, taking out loans by we want to buy a house. You want to buy a car, you simply get it from a large number of people. You're now moving into a cardless transactions for purchasing goods. We may not need the banks anymore. We may not need financial institutions the way we do right now, so, so there's gonna be disrupting happy to financial services, whether or not financial services we realized is that in the USA they seem to be complacent because they've got laws protecting them, but the same laws don't apply in other countries.

Speaker 1:          02:37          We may well have major innovations happening abroad, which companies now used to the United States. Look at healthcare that already we now have apple putting a stake in the ground saying, we're going to be the platform for health. They basically have to have announced their health platform. What they want is that all of these new sensor devices that are becoming common, which monitor your blood pressure, which monitor your blood oxygenation. We Monitor your heartbeats which monitor your temperature with mighty activity levels and soon which will monitor your blood glucose and monitor your internals. They want all of these data being uploaded to the apple platform. Do you think google, Google will be left behind? Do you think Microsoft will be left behind? Do you think Samsung will be left behind? Everyone is jumping into the act, but soon when you have all of these data, we were able to.

Speaker 1:          03:28          We will be able to transform the healthcare industry because we will be able to predict when someone is about to get sick, we will have ai based physicians. They can advise us when we're about to get sick, that can advise us on what we need to do to get healthy. When he said the problem that doctors have right now is that the data that we get back from medical tests is so complicated that they can't. They can often not understand it, especially in fields like cancer. If you look at the reports, and I've seen some of these reports is incredibly complex, add to it, the genome genomics area, we're going to be getting the cost of human genome sequencing has dropped to a thousand dollars over the last, uh, 15 years at the rate at which we're going. The cost of sequencing will be practically zero. So the, which means they will all have genomes done.

Speaker 1:          04:12          You combine that with the medical sensor data combined with the data we have in the cloud. You've got a healthcare revolution revolution. We won't need doctors for day to day medical advice anymore would have robotic surgeons doing sophisticated surgery. So we're going to impact the medical professionals. We're going to now append the entire healthcare system. There will be no it all in the next five to 10 years. People don't seem to understand this. Now. Look at the energy industry. We're fighting wars over oil. We, five years ago we worried about America running out of oil. Today we're talking about Saudi America because of fracking. Fracking is a harmful technology. Nevertheless, it is allowed America to become energy independent and soon to become an energy exporter. Forget about fracking. Solar itself is something we've become negative about, but solar has dropped about 97 point two percent over the past 35 years in price at the rate at which solar is advancing by the end of this decade, which is grid parody in the United States.

Speaker 1:          05:10          Great Parliament is cheaper to produce energy at home on your soda cells than buying from the grid. Move forward another 10 years. It costs you $100 much to, to, uh, produce your own solar, your own energy. Then to buy from the grid, which means that we have these great companies now in serious trouble. This is why you have the utilities fighting solar, that they're now started opposing solar subsidies. They're now doing everything they can to stop the solar industry because on its own solar, if it keeps advancing the way it will end and there's every indication that it will, it's going to eclipse the fossil fuel industry. And solar is one of maybe 100 technologies that are advancing which will change the energy industry. So now you have unlimited energy was guess what? We have unlimited clean water because we can simply bond much water as we wanted them to have unlimited water.

Speaker 1:          05:59          We can now have vertical farms in which we grow food locally. Imagine now having 100 percent organic food where you don't have to have have insecticides and so on, pumped into it because you haven't produced in sealed buildings in, in, in vertical farms. Imagine not being able to three d print meat so we don't have to start animals. So we're talking about upending agriculture and the food production industry so I can go on and on and on. Every industry I've looked at, I've seen major disruption. Even even a good old communications, they look at the impact 80 and t, verizon and sprint will suffer over the next decade or so. They've seen the landline business disappear, landlines went to a mobile and then now we have data. I mean when I travel abroad right now to make long distance calls anymore because I just call her a skype. Imagine when we have wifi everywhere.

Speaker 1:          06:50          Att and t and Google are competing now to do wire up a regions with super fast Internet access. What happens now when you have open networks everywhere, so so you can make phone calls over wifi networks. We're talking about disrupting the communications industry. I can go on and on and on, but every industry I look at, I see major disruption happening, so the world 10 to 15 to 20 years from now is going to be completely different. We're going to be disrupting industry after industry after industry. The vast majority of companies who are the leaders right now may not even exist because the problem is that not only are people not aware of it, most industry executives, they're not invested our money that will be required for them to reinvent themselves. They dare not put themselves out of business. So, so a major disruption as company is coming. Our industry heads are worried about short term performance. They did not see that this future we're headed into so they're going to be disrupted. We will have new industries coming out of nowhere eclipsing these, this old line industries, nutrilon, dollar industries, wiping out existing trillion dollar industries. This is the future we're headed into. For better or for worse.
