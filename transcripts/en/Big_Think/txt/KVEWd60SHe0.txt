Speaker 1:          00:10          I think the notion that Barack Obama is a radical is preposterous. Uh, Henry Louis Gates Jr who, um, is quoted in my book is saying that the only radical thing, the only truly radical thing about Barack Obama is that he's African American. And I think that's true that his politics are center center left. They come out of the tradition of the Democratic Party in many ways. They're continuations of lines taken by the Clinton administration. You know, look at the healthcare bill itself. This is a more modest healthcare building. Many proposed by others. He got what he could get and he succeeded. Um, look at these. So cold. I'm radical. Uh, nuclear arms treaty just signed with the Russians. There's a lot of criticism on the right saying, you know, Barack Obama is giving away our security. He is, um, he is stripping us of our capacity to project strength in the world and to protect ourselves.

Speaker 1:          01:11          And in fact the great leftwinger Ronald Reagan was far more radical when it came to nuclear arms policy. Remember Reykjavik in the period then Gorbachev Reagan period where those two men were intent on reducing nuclear stockpiles to nothing. And here we've reduced it by a third. I mean we, we there the notion that Barack Obama was somehow came out of a radical cauldron in, in, in Chicago and somewhere in his desk drawer, um, in the resolute desk in the Oval Office as a copy of Mark's and grom. She and Lennon is just obscene. It's ridiculous. And there are just too many elements in the media and in politics trying to stoke these fires for those absurd notions to disappear.

Speaker 1:          02:07          It's very difficult to see. I look, I think there is a legitimate conservative opposition as you'd expect. Of course that's going to happen. There's going to be a legitimate republican opposition. There's going to be battles. What concerns me is not that so much. What concerns me deeply is the outer edges of it and the nature of the outer edges of it. And the way it's though the outer edges of it are provoked by certain politicians and certain parts of the Internet and television and cable television and all the rest. And the end result of some of that kind of ugliness can be beyond our reckoning, really beyond our reckoning. And, um, I don't want to be too alarmist of it, but I remember for example, in Israeli politics during gets awkward beans time when the far right there stirred up to such a degree that the, that the political atmosphere in certain quarters became quite literally murderous. So I think we need to be very careful about, uh, lumping everybody together in its, even the tea party movement. I might not agree with any of it, but the extremes of it are really alarming.
