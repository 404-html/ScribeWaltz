Speaker 1:          00:05          There is no quick solution to all of this, but I want to, of course, the Security Council to use all the tools available to them, including sanctions, looking at whether we can put perpetrators to justice and to put them on their lists. Um, I want the government in the DRC and everywhere where this is a problem. It's not only an African problem to take this seriously. Also to do everything they can to ensure that we put an end to impunity, to address the problem of impunity and also to assist the women to empower women to make sure that they have a voice and a seat at the table where decisions are made. And so there are a number of things that the UN has to ensure that in peacekeeping operations, we can protect the civilians. And that means women, that we have to look at the best ways to protect civilians when we are contacted by a lot of people who have great ideas about to equip women with everything from sort of small weapons that could help them to defend themselves, to, to a communication gadgets.

Speaker 1:          01:31          You know, that they can, um, uh, one other women that they can call for help, etc. And I, I think everything is worth testing. Uh, you know, we hAve to do everything, but the, the thing is it should not fall on the women to actually also have to sort of physIcally defend themselves. This is a response. It's not a women's issue. This is a peace and security issue and we have to make sure that we go after the perpetrators. So I would put much more focused on, on fInding the perpetrators and punishing them to close every exit, every possible career possibility for, for these guys so that they know that there is no mercy for, for rapists.
