Speaker 1:          00:10          If I were a smart musician, I would have done what the other smart musicians did, which is only licensed your music in places where they don't speak English. That's, I mean all the credible musicians, I don't want to name names, but they don't license their music in the UK or the states. They license it. And Portugal are they licensed it and South Korea or Japan and that way the tastemakers, you know, the music journalists never hear about it. But it's, it's a strange phenomenon because, I mean, I have been criticized for licensing my music to commercials, but it's odd for a few reasons. One, that most of the journalists who've criticized me write for publications that are wholly funded by ad revenue. You know, so there'll be an article criticizing me for liking my music to commercials and on the next page, and an ad for Ford or budweiser or what have you.

Speaker 1:          00:58          And the same journalists who are people who criticize me for licensing my music. Actually, you know, by the products that are being advertised. And I don't know, I, maybe it's the old punk rocker in me. I always thought it was cooler to take money from a big corporation and to give money to a big corporation. So I have regrets that I did too much licensing. Um, and I should have as I had been smart and done what everyone else does is only licensed it to South Korea and Japan. When play came out, uh, at first it didn't have any success. You know, the reviews weren't very good. It didn't sell very well, and then it sort of picked up momentum and became a successful record. So at first the only, the only way I had to get people to make people aware of the music was by licensing it to movies, TV shows, advertisement.

Speaker 1:          01:45          So we did a lot of it. Uh, in hindsight, I think I did too much of it. There's another ironic aspect of it, which is that at the time people in the music business be, they're musicians or record executives, heap scorn on me for doing this. And that was all the same record executives are all working at licensing companies or they're working at record labels where they're desperate to license anything. And there's a lot of the musicians who also criticized me are now bending over backwards and frustrating prostrating themselves to try and get their music licensed. So I think that unfortunately, I don't mean this in a positive way. I was sort of the avant garde of licensing. You know, I was like the shock troop of licensing. So as a result I got killed first, you know, so now everyone does it and no one's really criticized for it.

Speaker 1:          02:32          Um, but yes, in hindsight, I definitely did way too much of it. But the only reason I got involved in the music business, it was because I love music and I want to make music. And selfishly I'd like people to hear the music that I make. Um, I'm not too concerned with the commercial ramifications of producing and producing music and putting it out into the world. If people want to buy my music, fine. If they don't want to, that's fine with me too. Uh, again, my, my only interest in the commercial side of the music business is to try and get people to hear the music that I've made. You know, so I don't, I don't look at the music business and think how can I make a lot of money from it? I look at it and I think, how can I strategically try and get people to hear the music that I've made? And so when I look at that, the fact that the record companies are falling apart and revenue streams are dying, drying up and royalties or you know, a 10th what they used to be for a lot of people, um, it doesn't concern me. Um, some from sort of like a fiduciary perspective, it only concerns me from a musician's perspective where I just hope that in the future I'm able to make music that people will be willing to listen.
