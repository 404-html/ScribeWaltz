Speaker 1:          00:07          I finished a book in the early part of 2007 for publication in October, 2007 on current and national affairs, um, because I think that the most important overarching thing going on is that the United States has to again become the land of opportunity and the land and the place that operates according to principles. So it's called America the principled six opportunities for becoming a can do nation once again. And so those six opportunities seem to me to be the most important issues. One is how do we secure our future? And security isn't simply a matter of watchdogs at airports. It's a matter of economic security. That's how we keep jobs in the United States for Americans. That's how we ensure that we have the technology to make us safe. And that requires investments in innovation and it requires open minds. So the life sciences are so important. And yet, um, they have been so discredited by an administration that has not cared about science.

Speaker 1:          01:16          We're not doing enough to educate people in the US in science and math, which are so important to our future. Most of the engineering and science degrees being given in the United States today, advanced degrees, phds are going to foreign nationals or people of foreign origins and as far as I'm concerned, they're welcome here, but I would also like to see our young people get those degrees. So that's, uh, that's the first challenge. I'm very concerned about the disappearing middle class and the problems of balancing work and family that women have. So pursuing happiness was something that's written into our earliest origins, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and awful lot of people aren't happy because they don't have healthcare because they have to take two jobs. They don't, they're worried about their children. So that's an important issue. Clearly the war in Iraq as an important issue currently, but it's part of a larger problem of how do we engage with the world.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Is our form of engagement only saber rattling or are we making those grassroots investments in the economic development of other countries and the development of their leaders so that we have more allies and friends around the world. That's a major challenge. We are not liked in many parts of the world. Well actually there's a gap between liking Americans as a people and liking the American government. Many more people like Americans than like the American government. We have an speaking of government. We have a problem with respect for government. In fact, in recent years people have discredited government because so many government officials have done things that are ethically challenged to put it in a positive way, but a lot of Washington was under indictment for awhile. So if we don't restore respect for government, I'm sick of politicians running against government. I'm running for this office because I believe that we shouldn't have these offices.

Speaker 1:          03:22          It's ridiculous. So we need respect. So the good people run for office in turn, they appoint competent people and they care about how well government is run. It's an. It's a traditional American principle to say that government is best, which governs least, but frankly it can't govern least unless it governs better because it's much more costly to have a disaster like Hurricane Katrina than it would have been to invest in the levees in New Orleans in the first place. And finally, I think we need a spirit of service. The partisan divides in the partisan ugliness and America has plagued us if we spend so much time arguing with each other while fighting wars that we can't possibly win and probably shouldn't have been in in the first place, then we will never heal this nation. We need things that bring us together across partisan divides as well as divides of race or age or or urban versus rural, and I think community service and the generosity of American philanthropy or things that can unite us. Again. So those are the themes that I've been writing about. Those are the things that I want on the agenda for the presidential election in 2008. Those are the things in the news that bother me the most, but also inspire me to think about solutions.
