Speaker 1:          00:06          Some of the most interesting studies near death and out of body experiences were run by the air force, right? As airplanes got faster and faster and faster over the past 20 years, right? Pilots kept flying themselves into g lock, gravity induced loss of consciousness. Right? And they kept crashing. So a guy named James winner was, was a guy kind of charged with solving this problem. And what he did is down in Texas, he spun like a thousand pilots in a giant centrifuge into g lock. Right? And as he was doing it, he noticed something interesting. She locked means you pass out and if you've experienced it, what actually happens is your vision forms into a tunnel. It looks like if you're, if you're watching it, it looks like an old television set turning off where it goes down into one point and then disappears. Right? So it looks experientially a lot like you're walking down a long dark tunnel, which is kind of one of the classic near death experience.

Speaker 1:          01:03          A phenomenon. What he discovered along the way is that as he started spitting people towards g lock, kind of the longer he spun them, people started reporting out of body experiences and after they were out of their body, if he kept spitting them, it would turn into a near death experience. Right? So he's the person that he was, air force is the person, the US Air Force discovered that outer body experiences in near death experiences are actually on the same continuum there. They're part of the same chain of effect and a lot of it has to do with the right temporal lobe. There's other things going on as well. And there are of course certain mysteries, right? There are unsolved things in near death experiences. We've got lots and lots and lots of research that shows people report things when they were supposedly dead that they should not have known about at all.

Speaker 1:          01:55          So there are people who died on operating tables, right in research. Studies came back, were brought back. They had near death experiences, and while they were dead, the nurse would take their glasses off and put it in a drawer, and later when everybody was running around looking around for their glasses, the person who was on the operating table at the time, the patient who was dead at the time said, oh yeah, they're in the bottom drawer over there. And this is a Pimm's Bon Llama Lamo study that was actually done in the Netherlands. This is where that actually happened. But there's a lots and lots of experiences like that. So somewhere along the line, information is getting through, right? We don't know that yet. That's still the mystery. But a lot of the other stuff, we understand the biology behind it now.
