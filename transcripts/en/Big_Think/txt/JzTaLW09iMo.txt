Speaker 1:          00:07          That's hard for me to predict. I know that this is a topic that to Michael Claire and other people have promoted as the idea that we're going to fight over water, oil, a timber, you name it. Um, what I see is a, is a world becoming more interdependent in everything. My book, the thesis of my book Gusher of lies is really that the world is interdependent in any number of commodities, whether it's ipods or beer or fresh flowers, tennis shoes, and that interdependence is going to strengthen actually in the coming years because we have no choice as different companies. I'm sorry, it's different. Countries become better at producing certain commodities. They will assert their influence in the marketplace. And my book debunks the idea that energy independence as possible, that it's doable or even desirable for the US. What we really need to be looking at is interdependence.

Speaker 1:          00:57          Um, and that is in fact what the market and energy and other commodities has had for, for decades and will continue to have there. There clearly is a lot of, uh, of rhetoric about the issue of oil and fighting over oil. I think what I see in the future as natural gas becomes a more critical player in the global economy. It is a, I think, much more of a bind necessity. It is a much more cooperative. Commercial enterprise pipelines require a stronger connections between countries, uh, and gas really is only effectively moved in at the moment, uh, by gas pipeline. We're going to see on an emerging gas market that has global due to the increasing use of liquified natural gas and I think compressed natural gas, which is not in the market yet, uh, in any significant degree, uh, at least in the marine market.

Speaker 1:          01:43          But I, I, I think I would argue the opposite. That I think as the world gets a more integrated, as the market for energy gets more integrated, I think that we're going to see a further cooperation among countries because it is in their commercial interest. And in fact, if you look at what has happened with the, uh, with your ran, despite America's efforts to isolate the Iranians, what we are, in fact seeing as the Iranians making multiple commercial deals with numerous countries around the world, uh, whether it's the Brazilians, the Turks, the Austrians, the Iranians are integrating their economy and their energy commodities into the global economy and doing it very effectively.
