Speaker 1:          00:08          The only overarching purpose or direction that I can think of for mankind as a whole is very well expressed in the definition of humanity, uh, that Pierre Teilhard de Short on provided. Now he was a Jesuit priest who, uh, lived in China for a long time and was a kind of an anthropologist. His, his definition of humanity was evolution become conscious of itself and it's a very powerful point of view if you think about it. My sense of humanity as a whole is that's what it is. We are alive, become conscious, uh, and therefore become able to understand what we're doing to set goals and they all. And that I think is possibly unique in the universe.
