Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13          are you talking about it is informed risk taking an informed risk taking in that culture is fundamental towards supporting innovation. Number two, they've got to be an educated population, uh, if, if you're working on something that you don't quite understand the probability of making it better by messing with it, just reduced. So if just think about those two tenants for awhile, a culture that supports it, and then number two, then, uh, enough, enough education and knowledge and teamwork to be able to go to go build it, that there are very few individuals anymore they can understand one of our products and some of them have over a billion transistors. It's hard to know what each one of them does, right? So there are teams of people that create these and they're bigger teams of people that try to validate them and distribute them, et cetera.

Speaker 2:          01:07          So if I was thinking about a third thing, it would be about building that culture of teamwork and allowing teams then being innovative at the Intel fellow level, the top, the very top approximately hundred scientists and technologists that we have, we tell them they can have half the time to themselves and they can go work in that. Very few of them actually take us up on that. But the offer is genuine now it means in some, in some area that they have some expertise, right? Um, we actually haven't really faced a lot of that difficulty because because our products are so incredibly complex, beautifully complex, one could argue and because there's so much change that goes on all the time. So if you're interested in the field of computing, working for Intel is just our great place to be. Right. And they have a tendency to work in, to work in work in that area.

Speaker 2:          02:08          Now we, we try to go off and then there was a pretty formal process for determining in the R and d labs what technology's still hold promise and when to kind of reduce the funding in an area. And when and when to move it forward. So we have a lot of process until it's a process driven company. We have a lot of processes that do that, but fundamentally the idea is that you can do most of the development in the area of expertise, some form of computing. And then in the research labs themselves, a very organized process to determine which ones we continue to find out which ones we, uh, uh, we pass on.

Speaker 2:          02:52          Well, there's the culture. The first one I answered the tenants of the culture would be first you have to respect that. And that means doesn't always work. The second one is education. Talked about that. See if there's a third one. Oh, well, I think the third one is really you have to just feel inwardly wonderful about the success. So if you step back and say, okay, you're allowed to fail, and then people are educated, then do you really celebrate those people that can move it forward. And sometimes a team moves it forward and then sometimes you know, just one person makes a difference. And we give away the intel achievement awards every year and lots of times those are teams of people where, you know, our team has done something really innovative and you have a little bit of money, but we give them a great party, uh, that every once in a while it was just one individual who stands up and it's so clear at the corporate level that that one person moved intel and those are really special.

Speaker 2:          03:57          We, we, we do throw the party, but it's not that much of it. Um, let's step back and say what innovation really is. Innovation is the ability to build a new product or new service in some way that that betters the product line or hopefully is solving a customer need better than before. So we reward that. First of all, this is a, be careful what you ask for. You know, really good design engineers have a tendency to then become group leads and they can certainly move up that engineering chain. We allow, we allow scientists and engineers to either move up into a management change or stay on their technical leadership towards an Intel fellow. And an Intel fellow board until senior fellow is the same, you know, range in the company, same grade, same salary if not more than vice presidents. So there is, you know, we, we kind of put our money where I'm out there and we recruit, retain and we award those people that can move this technology forward in, in, in a meaningful way.

Speaker 2:          05:03          And then the second thing, which I keep trying to say what really makes it work, you've got people around you that shared this culture that want to be doing it too, that when you know, when you call them up at at night and you say, yeah, I know it's after work, but I just got to talk to you about this. I'm so excited and they don't hang up on you. So I think it's that combination of respecting the individual and in dealing with all the management structures and changes and challenges that result by then second of all, having a culture and being able to recruit other people into the organization that share that common goal set.

Speaker 2:          05:38          There are a lot of people that would say that we have lost some of that edge and some would argue with that vehemently. So let me just point out the data, right? The data are that, that we're no longer producing the most engineers. We are no longer producing the most amount of, uh, uh, uh, the most amount of, of, uh, uh, uh, of new new companies. We have been the technological lead in the world. We really had technical supremacy for decades and are higher our lead, our higher education institutions still have that. We have the best higher education system in the world, but if we really want to remain a technological powerhouse in the next 30 years, we need to start internalizing though all those scores that are coming out to explain that we're in the twenties in math and science. Our children are not as well educated. They don't have the same work ethic whether we like it or not. That's what the test indicate. And I think we have to look at the systemic issues that are causing that and go after it.

Speaker 2:          06:50          Enjoying them. If you, if you step back and you say, uh, there's a creative, people will always give you the, you will spend most of your time on creative people and, and that means that they will be the people that you, you, you know, you want to most embraced. Sometimes you're just most want to argue with the others because it depends on where they're going at any given at any given moment, but most will usually have to enjoy and respect their creativity. If, if creative people believe they are liked and respected, then they will continue to be more and more creative. And I don't, I don't necessarily relate creativity with, with lack of discipline. You can be very creative within a discipline. So if we're talking about how do you deal with undisciplined creative people than I think, then I think that's just a matter of trying to establish a common goal.
