Speaker 1:          00:06          I think plants present an opportunity for people to look closely at something and get invested in something that's truly very much outside of themselves. Plants are not like us and the more you study plants, the more different and deep ways you see that they are not like us. All the important things that we do from how we move around to how we reproduce to how we react to the sun. Any human activity you could point to,

Speaker 2:          00:55          hey,

Speaker 1:          00:55          you're going to see something very different in plants and the more you know about how plants function and the more you watch them function and test their functioning, the more deeply you understand how different they are. I think that's useful because I think people have a need to transcend themselves. And I know that when I get bogged down in, um, the dysfunctionalities of how people treat each other and conflicts between men and women and, and money problems in science and all this kind of thing that I can, uh, take some comfort and joy and transcending what seemed like very small scale human noise. And look at the differences and a life form. That's been successfully occupying the planet for 400 million years, so quite frankly, I get a lot of joy and comfort and happiness from considering these things. I mean, I think that's the main reason to do sciences, that it feeds the soul.

Speaker 1:          02:04          I think that, and I see this in students year after year, that the more you know about the world, the more you feel like you're part of it and it's like nothing else. You know, you teach somebody not to just walk by a tree but to look up at it and say, Yep, that one's deciduous and that one's evergreen and that one is going to lose it sleeves this fall, but that one's going to stay green. Just very basic things like that and you see people sense of self and self esteem rise and all of a sudden they know something about the world that they journey through and it makes them a little bit bigger as a person and that's really a wonderful thing to watch in students and to be able to facilitate. So I think we should plant trees not to save trees. I think planning a tree is not unlikely to be a method you use to save yourself and to find meaning and something that will be with you and grow with you

Speaker 1:          03:27          and be something you can come back to and contrast your own life with. I'm very influenced by some research that came out, I think in the eighties that compared retention during learning. And I remember very strongly that the main result of that was the, the larger, the number of senses that you invoked if you were touching something, if you were writing and listening and watching and even smelling something or tasting, you know, the more senses that you could engage during learning the more effectively that information was integrated into the person and learned, I think with digital media, we're very, very strongly going towards a medium that is visual only. I mean, you do hear the message, etc. But I worry that it's a passive stance just in terms of using the five senses and that, um, you can't learn passively. I think the Best learning is done with active manipulatIon.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Um, and we need to be able to work with our hands. you know, it's not just about using our brains. I mean, eventually we have to manipulate the world with our hands in order to make tangible change, right? And, um, students need practice with that. Kids need practice with that. We need to do that in life. And uh, for better or worse, you know, our screen experiences will never, never give us that. It's very important to put children in an environment where they can take things apart, uh, where they can break things and then learn to fix them where they can trust their hands and know their capacity to manipulate objects. And I see that as a much more active interaction than what the newer types of technology offer as they supply learning. So, you know, I'm not anti screen, et cetera, but I do worry that the hours we spend that way are replacing some of the things that are going to be important.
