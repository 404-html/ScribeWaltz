Speaker 1:          00:09          I'm the one when we move, we moved, we went to Ireland because of the death death of my, my little sister. And there were uh, my brother frank, myself and twin boys, oliver and Eugene, and when we got to Ireland, uh, we want to, within two years the two boys, you're Jaden Oliver died when they were about four and four and a half of various ailments at the time that nobody cared too much about what was going on with poor people. There were no autopsies or anything. He just died. He just died and good riddance. But, uh, but when we got a children's levels, three and a half, frank was born, uh, uh, we were known as Yanks and uh, you feel outside the tribe when you are speaking differently, acting differently, behaving differently. So as quickly as possible, you made the attempt to be a get in with the gang, talk like them and be like them and dressed like them.

Speaker 1:          01:25          So, but no, no matter what we did, we were still yanks. So then we grow up there and we come to America, uh, back to America back here. And they say, Oh, you're Irish over there were yanks over here were Irish. So my brother frank and myself decided a long time ago that worked for your very simply is we are New Yorkers. This is our country, this is my land, this is the place for me where every single dream I ever had came to fruition and I love her dearly. I love Yellow York to be Irish in 2010, 2010. There was a. There is a pride in our

Speaker 1:          02:30          that that that's happened in our intellectual accomplishments and our literary accomplishments, accomplishments in our technological accomplishments, but here to for a after, oh, 800 years of occupation and the function of the oppressor is to assure you that you are nothing, that you're nobody, that you're less than deserving of nothing. That you are a piece of shit and I'm don't aspire to anything, and they infuse you with with shame, which has to do with the past because the all shamans based family in the past. It has to do with what you have done, what you thought you will have done. Ad Wants has sometimes seamus and juiced by what has been done to you and by allowing things to be done to you, you are ashamed of not resisting. So that's one part of a of oppression is to make sure, make sure you're a shameful, shamed human being, a then on the other, and that takes care of the past and the future has to do with fear.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Don't attempt to come up here. Don't attempt to go forward. You are, you were nobody. You are nobody and you'll always be nothing. So don't even think about coming here because if you do something awful will happen to you. So we were, we were caught between the two demons to devil's shame and fear, and we couldn't deal with the present, which was that we are indeed as accomplished in our own minds, as spiritual, as any other people, as good as any other people. But uh, we could not look in the mirror. I never said that. That's what we are. So to be Irish today is the abandonment of that shame and the younger people are moving it out and they're moving the fear away. They're not afraid, they're adventurous, they're going about the world as a care, not carefree, carefree, I suppose. But as with confidence and with the, uh, with the knowledge of the language, with the education, linguistically capable, poetic and fun, loving with a love of song and of life itself.

Speaker 1:          05:28          So that for the younger people to be is, um, is, is a great, this wonderful thing that is happening. The older ones of my generation are, um, in infused with. They're still have the fear and the various ethnic groups have, have diseases that are peculiar to their group. And for example, Jewish people have a taste sacks and the African Americans have sickle cell anemia. And the, uh, the Irish disease was respectability and that infects them a lot. And there was a, what would somebody say was, what would they say? What would the English say if you wore that? Said that, be that. So consequently, as the Irish poet a, he said you eventually become the thing you hate the most. That's why so many of these Yahoos, particularly the ones that run the center St Patrick's Day parade are conservatives. And that conservatism is, is not a political ideology.

Speaker 1:          06:41          It is a form severe form of brain damage for which has hardly any cure. I don't know what, uh, what we can do with them as a whole, but they are gradually moving out. The younger folks have taken over and some day there may be some culture in this St Patrick's Day, but I prefer if it were an Irish parade like Israel, Israel has a as a, a parade that's Israel not devoted to Moses or Abraham or Moses and Abraham. And so I'd like to see the day when this was an Irish because you can't be grand marshal of this charade if you're not a, a Catholic. And they say a practicing Catholic. Now, a lot of these guys are hypocrites when they are about, they're about as a practicing as, as I am. And I don't certainly am not. I have the whole thing myself. But they are the, it's hypocritical anyway, and I hope that one day it will be an IRA would be nourished, prayed, then I would march future. If you have, if you have one foot in the future and one foot in the past, you're pissing on the present. So I stay in the present. So I don't know about the future.
