Speaker 1:          00:06          For me at least, I don't really take anything for granted is the way that I feel. Because you see, you see multiple ways of living, you see your, your express. I think what happens here is that people get so used to this idea of, of, of America as a place where anything and everything should happen. And you know, where as Americans, I think we're a very entitled bunch or we, you know, and I think that having seen that, that's not the case around the world. You're very aware of that. And I think everything here then takes on a new meaning. It's one that's not to say that, that, that, that, I mean like, you know, when you say something like that, people can say, oh well you think you're better than everyone else. That's not it at all. I mean, I think everybody's still falls into that.

Speaker 1:          00:49          And I would say that I'm just as entitled, I feel just as entitled and probably behave just as entitled as the next American as the next person here. I think at the same time having the ability to step out, right, having the ability to be in another place and see how people perceive you as an American and then not just see, but also actively participate in that perception of Americans really is a self check. It's a way of looking at your, your behavior as a member of this particular society or this particular culture. And I think it leads to, for me at least, I feel like my life has completely enriched. I mean, being Nigerian obviously are being a Nigerian American also means that I'm a black American, which is also another set of perspectives. I mean obviously given the history that black Americans have in this society, it's different for me because I'm not, you know, I'm not, my family doesn't go generations deep here, but you still experience the same things and you still have that, that, that outlook and you still have that way of seeing how things are put together in this society.

Speaker 1:          01:44          And I think, you know, having, again, being in, in, in a weird way also not really being in because you're, you're part of this, of, of your black American, right? I am a black American, but at the same time it's a different version, right? And it's a multiple, it's a different version. It, it allows, I think having those different versions of being a black American allows multiple perspectives and, you know, different analysis of what being a black American meetings. I think all too often the society has to monolithic definition of what a black American is. And I think having, you know, being a Nigerian man, American being black, being African adds to that definition, at least in my own case. Right? And I think it helps, uh, in the largest sense if, you know, for all the people who are black Americans from this part of the country, from that part of the country, if you are going to be an American, if you're Nigerian American, if you're Caribbean American, to add nuanced and structure to that definition of black American. Um, and so allow people to see that it's not just one thing. It's not just one culture, that it's a multiplicity of cultures and that's important both for, for the recognition of that set of people as full citizens and also for the, for the, for the country as a whole.
