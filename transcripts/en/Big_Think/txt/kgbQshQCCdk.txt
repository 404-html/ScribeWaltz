Speaker 1:          00:00          You've got to accept that not everybody is going to care about every thing equally. And they're sort of different categories of people always in and around a given cause or given effort. I mean there are people who care passionately about it who have a direct personal connection. What we wanted to be sure to do was make sure that for the motivated person who's got a target and a goal, that that what we were engineering was an incredible toolbox for them to use all of our best ideas that we've ever had and even to source from other people by surfing around in the site, effective ways of taking their motivation and their energy and you know, leveraging it into really good productivity in terms of their personal fundraising. So on the one hand you want to supply the motivated person with everything they need to do a really good job.

Speaker 1:          01:00          The next ring out is people who might not have a specific connection. And if the motivated person who cares, who's reaching out to their own circles of people, take people who are already donors to you and turn them into small fundraisers for you. You know, I mean, if a person is capable of giving 50 bucks themselves, but it's really easy for them to reach out to their family and friends and just on the strength of personal relationships, say, could I get, um, you know, 10 more people to donate 50 bucks, then they've just multiplied their own capacity by 10 times. Anyone who was involved in fundraising will tell you that that kind of multiplying effect has huge ramifications.
