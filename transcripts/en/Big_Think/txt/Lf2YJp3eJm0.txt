Speaker 1:          00:07          I think there's two things that I've really seen in my perspective, the Internet changing, one is who's using it and to how it's being used. You know, I went to school at Uc Santa Cruz right when the Internet was really being developed and I can remember doing my, you know, my coding, you know, my das coding and I was on computers land. It was a very impersonal, um, medium. Um, and then websites came where you went to the website and you got information and maybe you did ecommerce. But what's really changed about the Internet now it's become much more of an intimate of tool. It's about for many people it's about their life. It's about we go on Amazon, it's about the books that they might like, you know, what's recommended. They're reading the reviews that they're their friends or even strangers instead of just advertisement. So the whole Internet has become, with facebook, with my space is become much more of an intimate and personal thing.

Speaker 1:          00:56          And because of that, I think that the dynamics and who is using it have really changed. I think it started off as sort of a white male, sort of a geeky tool and now actually more women are online. The men are more women are blogging than men are women. It's really a women's a medium. If you think about it. I mean we are through our brain chemistry. We're wired to be connected to other people and the Internet is such a powerful way to connect whether it's through, you know, my space or I'm a facebook or twitter, you know, I think a lot of these things are going to come and go. I think twitter will come and then you know, who knows? There might be a new version of twitter that technology may change, but the truth is is that people are gaining relationships in new ways than they ever have been. Like I can talk to someone in Ghana about a problem with genital mutilation that I never was before. So it's become much more of an intimate tool. It's changed politics.

Speaker 1:          01:53          What's interesting now with Intel, Andy Grove is always poking holes in his company to try to find out, you know, whereas competitors are going to come in and take them out all at one time was the breakthrough technology and then all of a sudden aol is sort of an old story in the new stories, facebook and sort of what will be next after that. There's so much. The convergence between the web and television is completely is what's next. You know, every, almost every household has a television. It's part of our lives. It's part of our identity and that intimacy that we see both through the Internet and also what people are enjoying watching. People love American idol because it's an intimate show. They're seeing people like themselves reflecting. So I'm not sure exactly where it's going, but I know we're going to continue to have user generated content. I think people are going to be booking, they're creating their own television shows. Um, I think that, uh, um, there's going to be much more instant response to the way that television works and we're just going to see a convergence.
