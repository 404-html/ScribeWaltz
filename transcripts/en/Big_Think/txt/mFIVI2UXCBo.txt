Speaker 1:          00:05          Um, I think it may have something to do with the myths of the gala to at least the ideal of Galitary aneurysm, um, that, uh, it's better to be a regular guy. I'm with sort of good standing in the community, good character and so on than to be a, an egghead eggheads, uh, a suspected. And that's not just American culture. I think that's, that was true traditionally in, in, in Britain as well. And there's something to be said for it. I mean, there are, there many unpleasant, uh, effects of, of that kind of fillets, Philistinism. But the good thing is that ideas can be dangerous. Intellectuals are dangerous where you give them too much power because they tend to take ideas to their extreme and uh, they're not practical people in the whole. Um, and it's good, I think to be a little suspicious of taking idea, any idea to its extreme and it's probably better to have people in power who are more practical and who can, who know the art of compromise.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Well, I think he would be, on the one hand, probably a shocked because some of his, um, possibly some of his is worse, his most pessimistic predictions would seem to have come true and that he, he, he, he was on the one hand in favor of democracy and he admired American democracy, but he was frightened of the possible consequences. He thought it could lead to tremendous vulgarity and so on. And I think he probably would see that and you would also see a much less a conformist population probably than the one he saw, depending on where he would travel, of course. Um, and I think he probably would be rather shocked by the tone of the public figures of the politicians who are probably less little less high minded than the ones that he encountered when he was there.
