Speaker 1:          00:00          In 2014 I announced one of my boldest companies. It's a company called Human Longevity Inc. Uh, Co founded it with Craig Venter, the first guy sequenced the human genome. Uh, and Bob Hariri, one of the top stem cell scientists and businessmen in the world. And we founded human longevity incorporated as a means to extend the healthy human lifespan to make a hundred years old. And you're 60. And in the first year of operations, we built the largest genome sequencing facility in the world. Uh, and that genome sequencing facility besides your genome, uh, the 3.2 billion letters from your father and the 3.2 billion letters from your mother, we are also sequencing your microbiome. You are a collection of 10 trillion human cells and a hundred trillion bacterial cells. But besides that, you're full phenotype, your, uh, your Mri, the full imaging of your body, your Metabolome, the 2,400 chemicals in your bloodstream. All of this data is being collected.

Speaker 1:          01:02          And then we're using machine learning to mine that data for the secrets of what drives cancer, what drives heart disease, what drives neurodegenerative disease. With a mission of making sure that when you're a hundred, you look good, you move good, you think good, you feel great. And uh, I think that's where we're going. Our ability to rapidly sequence a genome, take what was $100 million and nine months down to 1000 bucks in a few hours, is going to unlock the secrets. We are the product of our genome. How you look, how you sound, the structures of your brain are all coded for in our genes. So as we unlock this, we're going to create tremendous breakthroughs in the healthy human lifespan. Inventing new drugs that are personalized to you. It's going to reinvent health on an epic scale.
