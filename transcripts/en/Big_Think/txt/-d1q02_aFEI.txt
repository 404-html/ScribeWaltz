Speaker 1:          00:09          One of the things that came out of my research, if you truly by the idea that this is a way of thinking about the world, like the scientific method, it's a way of dealing with the world as a way of thinking about solving problems in the world. Then you should be able to solve business problems with it. So one of the things I started thinking about a lot more as I wrote about my research was how would I take this logic, this way of reasoning and apply it in a business setting, like in a social setting, if you will. So a, I walked into class one day and I asked people, why can't I buy futures contracts in Rwandan prosperity, right? So why is it that when we try to solve something like poverty or a women's progress or a education b seemed to think that we need to use a different set of tools that business.

Speaker 1:          01:08          So that was one of the questions I had and I started thinking through, you know, how would an expert entrepreneur actually tackled any of those problems? And I gave you the example of moment with you this already, who is a great example of somebody who take it exactly like a lot of the expert entrepreneurs that I studied and ended up actually solving a social problem with surveys to a reasonable extent. Of course, it's a lot more work to be done. At least he showed the one way to solve the problem. And for me it's a, it's kind of a two problems in one in the sense that it also lifts people out of poverty and it helps women do it. It empowers women. So I find that very, very close to my heart, if you will. So if you start looking for people who have solve social problems and in a, in a reasonably big way, and you find the same kind of thinking, then it begs the question, uh, as to why we would not use business tools, why would be, don't use entrepreneurial thinking to solve some of those problems.

Speaker 1:          02:15          And that line of thought has led me to an interesting problem that I want to this post. And that is because a lot of entrepreneurs in the social sector think like entrepreneurs in the for profit sector, but somehow the funding part of it is so different that it makes the social sector problems very different and difficult. And so one of the things I want to think about is what would have to change the way we fund problems in the social sector, uh, so that entrepreneurial thinking can actually do the kind of development that has been made possible at the for profit sector in places like India and China. So that's one of the questions that I want to leave people with to think about. What would it take to create something that is equally valid to all the different kinds of credit markets and innovative financial instruments that we see in the for profit sector.

Speaker 1:          03:16          I know this is a really bad time to talk about innovative financial instruments, but I also think it's a great time for that very same reason that the same innovative a mindset that you have in the financial secretary. You could actually take it over to the social sector. I think something interesting things can happen and so I do want to give you just one example or maybe two on that because close to my heart and you can decide what to do with it. Uh, one example I have is this company called Looney Uhh, which has come up with a venture capital model for funding education in Latin America. Uh, another uh, instrument that I'm looking at is a fixed income instrument to fund education in Pakistan. As I mentioned, these are education issues are kind of close to my heart.

Speaker 1:          04:09          What I want to talk about is the innovations in funding that are available in the for profit sector that are not available in the social sector and not even innovations things that were innovations once upon a time, but things that we take for granted now they're just efficient ways of funneling resources into particular companies and matching up different investors with different companies. For example, let's think about something like a, you know, more fuel efficient cars, right? So one of the ways, uh, you think about how do you want to think about buying a fuel efficient car? You can check out all the different models that are there and you can hear people pitch by the electric car is so much better than the hybrid or uh, you know, natural gas would be even better or you can actually have, you know, turn on CNBC or a on CNN or the technology section or something like that and you and you can listen to different people pitch you different things and then you can take your pick.

Speaker 1:          05:20          You can spend a little bit more time and do some more analysis or research if you want. And you can say, here's the kind of car I want to buy. You can also think through which, which car company you want to invest in a. But there's no channel that I can turn on and here, you know, two guys from the Congo say, uh, talk to me about how they are going to solve the illiteracy problem in the Congo. And I think through which one do I want to actually back and go home, do a little bit of research and a couple of clicks on the computer and I send the money to that. One. We never think about social sector problems in the same way. That's the kind of thing, I mean, and let's say one of those two guys in the Congo as a really poor way of solving the illiteracy problem in such a way that the problem's solved.

Speaker 1:          06:10          And uh, you know, it creates a financially self sustaining model. Uh, there's no way we can just simply create a franchise of 1200 of those kinds of schools that spread all over Africa or we can important to Brazil. We don't think about social sector problems though that way and we don't have any of the channels that infrastructure that exists that allow entrepreneurs to not just build ventures but to grow them and to spread them out and to create variations through competition, things like that. So I allow a lot of those things and most of us will recognize those market mechanisms, right? They don't exist in the social world. It's like really good smart people reinvent the wheel all the time in the social sector. So my question really is that the essence of entrepreneurial thinking exists on the side of entrepreneurs building ventures in the social sector, but it seems to be very much lacking on the funding side and that's where I think I would like to do some work and some of my colleagues and I are beginning to work on it and we call those markets in here.

Speaker 1:          07:25          Would hope. I just wanted to mention that because I want to leave like a everything that I have talked about here on a what to do next problem and I think for those of us interested in innovative ideas in business and especially a, the logic of entrepreneurs that is going to be, for me, I think the next frontier to think through how do we bring entrepreneurial thinking to the funding side of the social sector? Uh, lots of good stuff are happening on the ground both on the entrepreneur side that is a venture building side and the funding side. But I think there's a lot of exciting opportunities on the funding side for entrepreneurs to get in there. Uh,

Speaker 2:          08:06          would.
