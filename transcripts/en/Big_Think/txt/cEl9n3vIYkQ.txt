Speaker 1:          00:09          From a personal standpoint, I like to think that I'm, that I am making a contribution and however big or however small it is, what are, what I'm trying to do is to help solve major social problems. That's what I want to do. That's sort of my life's work, if you will. And I've worked very hard at this. I've, I've done it now for a long, long time and I've worked on everything from seat belt safety to a third world development to the things that we do at arp. And I'm a couple of examples of successes, not me personally, but that, uh, we've been able to have it. ARP is that we get prescription drugs into Medicare and you cannot practice modern medicine without prescription drugs. So long term that's going to have a huge payoff for our country and for our older citizens. Um, a few years ago we fought the good fight and we were able to prevent social security from being privatized. That for us was a big win and I think a big win for the country. So I'm, I like to look at these a, and there are plenty of, of losses as well as wins. Uh, I'd like to look at these as steps forward and hope that I made a contribution to

Speaker 1:          01:26          the baby boomers have a huge contribution. In fact, I wrote a book about it. It's called 50 plus igniting a revolution to reinvent America. And what 50 plus is about is the fact that the boomers have so much more to contribute. Uh, they're going to leave a legacy. They are, they're making change. Now in terms of working longer in terms of, uh, you know, what's happening in the marketplace. Uh, some of the other issues I talked about in terms of healthcare and so forth, the boomers, uh, have been catered to their whole lives. They've reinvented every aspect of life. They've gone through a, they're going to reinvent retirement, uh, and they've got an attitude.

Speaker 2:          02:12          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:13          Well, the biggest I think is a lack of political will that we talked about before. Trying to get the, uh, the policy changes we need to prepare for an aging society. Uh, it's very difficult right now to see how we can break that partisan gridlock that we face in Washington and in many state capitals. Um, and, and part of it has to be that the public has to demand change. Uh, so that's one of the things that is a very tough for us to deal with, but there are others as well. For example, um, a lot of people are in this country because they haven't been able to save for retirement for whatever reason, are going to be really dependent upon social security. And social security was not ever meant to be an entire source of retirement living. It was meant to be a kind of a safety net kind of a floor. And so I'm helping people who need a helping hand, helping older people, uh, who are not going to be well off as many boomers are, is a key part of what we have to think about.

Speaker 3:          03:20          Okay.
