Speaker 1:          00:07          The academy is a huge enterprise in, in the United States there are 6,500 institutions that do higher education. There are public and private. There are community colleges to research universities. They're there, they're large, they're small, they're urban, they're rural, so the the university and college and Community College, the Higher Education Complex in the United States is unbelievably diverse and by the way that's one of its great strengths is because it is decentralized, it, it's. It's highly competitive on one hand, highly cooperative on the other and it's hard to think of any question to which there's a single answer for the entire complex realism of higher education that that having been said, if I were to try to focus on one issue that that loomed large across the entire spectrum of the 6,500 schools that are operating in higher education. I would say that there is at this moment in this country which which has without question a higher education system. That is the envy of the world. There is in process a tectonic change in the way our society views higher education and it is not for the good. There is bias and law judge, a subliminal devaluation of higher education even as we overtly as a society say how important it is, so we're disinvesting in it. We're beginning to treat it more as a private good. Then as a public good, and and this in the long term is is quite a challenge to the higher education establishment,

Speaker 1:          02:05          but I went to school here in New York state. There was a New York state regents scholarship that you could win as a, as a competitive prize that paid for room board and tuition for you to go to a private school and today the aid that's given by New York state is, is a small fraction of the cost of attending anything but a public school. So it's a small fraction of paying the cost of attendance at one of the elite private colleges or universities of New York state. Now, part of that is because what we expect from higher education has has, has gone up that that the cost of a private education has gone up greatly, but, but that's because the quality of what's being provided has gone up greatly. That the diversity of courses, the, the, the ratio of faculty to students that we as a society have have not continued the willingness we showed after World War Two to invest heavily in that higher education, whether it be in the research side or in making it available to students and, and that in the long term is a major mistake by public policy makers.
