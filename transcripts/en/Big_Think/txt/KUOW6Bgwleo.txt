Speaker 1:          00:05          Consciousness Freeville as often misunderstood because we know what they reference, but it's difficult to know what by content, what we really mean by free will. A lot of people will immediately feel that freewill is related to whether the university is deterministic or probabilistic and about physics has some ideas about that which change every now and then. It's not part of our experience and I don't think it makes a difference. If the universe forces you randomly to do things or deterministically. The important thing seems to meet that in Freeville you are responsible for your actions and responsibilities is social interface. For instance, if I am told that if I do x, I go to prison and this changes my decision to whether or not to do x, I'm obviously responsible for my decision because it wasn't a spiel to my responsibility in some sense or likewise, if I do a certain thing that it causes harm to other people and they don't want that harm to happen, that influences my decision.

Speaker 1:          01:03          This is a just course of decision making that we, I would call, it's a free vote decision. We'll list the representation that my nervous system at any level of its functioning has raised a motive to an intention. It has committed to a particular kind of goal. Let's get integrated into the story of myself, this protocol that I experience of as myself and as well, and that was what I experienced as well as it will decision and this decision is free and in as much as this decision can be influenced by this course. So to me for evil is a social notion. It means that this interface also have social interaction of discourse of thinking about things, about this interface of knowledge, language, conceptual thought as relevant for that. A decision if you a decision in which it doesn't play a role for instance because you already addicted to something and you cannot stop doing it even if you want to.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Then this decision I would say is not free. I grew up in eastern Germany, it was communist, eastern Germany and it was a very weird ideology of the country, a country that believed in stories about how the world works. That I as a nerd thought, obviously not quite true. I had difficulty believing the official stories about how the world works. It was like some weird kind of religion. And then the wall came down and it didn't surprise me in the least. And then we entered a new dream, a new shared, a model of the world. It was not quite true. And I realized that most people now fall for this new model. It was very interesting for to see if it's for me. And um, if you look for instance, at the u s the majority of us Americans do not believe in the theory of evolution.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Despite all the evidence to the contrary. Uh, the majority of people are on this planet are religious, even though that doesn't seem to be very good evidence for a multitude of Creator Gods and so on, in my view, at least. And if it existed, if a creator God exists, it would be very hard for me to why this creator, God really does care about whether I worship it or, um, um, all these things that we attribute to create God's fire religion. So it's, it's very hard for me in some sense to intuitively understand why humans are religious invite humans are ideological. But I think now over the years, um, that this is not a bug. It's a feature. Humans are a programmable species. Religions and ideologies are operating systems for societies and they have been so throughout most of our history and this idea that we can build society based on rational arguments is very, very recent and very novel.

Speaker 1:          03:39          And it's not entirely clear if it really works, but it's clear that we cannot really build societies on conflicting ideologies that are at war with each other. In the past that has led to situations where the ideology solve the problems by killing the unbelievers or their religions did the same thing. And we all agree this is not what you want to have. We want to have an open society, pluralistic society and nonviolent tolerance society, but still one where people work together and cooperate. That and this ability to wake up into a shared dream in which people believe things because their neighbors believe them has been a very powerful feature. That's probably the reason vive, you were able to build our scale societies. We have to understand that when people cooperate, they're very often in what we call a prisoner's dilemma, a situation. And in order to achieve the greatest good, you have to give up something for yourself, even as in a situation where that is in some sense a bit irrational.

Speaker 1:          04:36          Because if everybody else is not doing it, you're going to be worse off. And for these prisoners, Sal, I must be, have various solutions. The easiest solution is to have a reputation system. You basically keep track of who did what when, and you make sure that only the good guys, uh, get cookies in the future. And the problem is that these reputation systems do not scale. If you have too many people in your tribe or your family or in your village, you just lose track of who did what when. And you cannot really synchronize it by our talking about it. So after a couple of hundred individuals, the reputation system doesn't work very well. It also doesn't really work if you are not looking. So if nobody is doing this surveillance, um, how do you make sure that nobody is affecting and stealing stuff from the fridge of your tribe?

Speaker 1:          05:24          Right? So, um, what do we do? We evolve the ability to be normative. The ability or the need to be good and this need to be good. This need to follow internalized norms. This need to serve sacred principles is something that is probably a feature that is ingrained into our genetic makeup. And of course this alone would not be good enough because goodness is like an arbitrary vector and value space. People also have a need to synchronize what's good. So people will try to feel what's good in their ingroup. It works by empathy is the primary mode in which we transmit norms. If you dress up somebody as an authority, as a priest, as a professor, as a pop star is a politician and this person says a certain thing was conviction and people see that, others believe it, they start leaving it themselves. And it's obviously very useful to do this.

Speaker 1:          06:15          There's almost never a situation where it's useful to have an opinion that is different from the opinion of your boss. So this is the ability that we got. And it means that people perform the same things that they have followed the same rules regardless of the size of the group. And this makes it possible to build agricultural societies. There's hundreds of thousands of individuals and then millions of individuals. It makes it possible that this agricultural society has people that specialized on different fruits and different traits and different materials and different crafts and so on and produce all the multitude of tasks and tools that we need to get an agricultural society to run and be able to outcompete the nomadic societies. And I think the reason by Homo Sapians is the only hominid species that's left us because we out competed them all. We were in the same competitive niche and be various species that was programmable. There was able to coordinate arbitrary logical, buff individuals. That was very powerful. It just turns out that this mode of tribal organization is not sufficient for the world that we live in now.

Speaker 2:          07:24          Mm.
