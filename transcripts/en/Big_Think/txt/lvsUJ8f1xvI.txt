Speaker 1:          00:09          It's kind of funny cause after the elections I was at this press conference for Black Youth vote and I was talking about all the work that we did with our campaign powerboat and they'll, so this article came out with in the Associated Press and basically I had said a statement that's like, well, and this really happened, you know, after the elections,

Speaker 1:          00:34          Fox News and, and white people. I just knew we're like, yeah this is great. You know, racism is over now that we have a black president. And it's like, first of all, your statement in of itself shows that racism isn't dead because if it was you wouldn't acknowledge that he was black in the first place. Um, and so it gotten like 200 different papers, like randomly who's like really strange. But I got things like face, like, like these blogs, these conservative bloggers like attacking me. And that was the first time it was like, Whoa, like, you know, googling my name, finding images and putting it on blogs so they could talk stuff about me and that with like crazy to me.

Speaker 2:          01:22          But

Speaker 1:          01:24          it was like they were upset cause I had the audacity to say that no, racism isn't dead. And even though we Obama won, we still have to work. Like it's not just going to be up to Obama. He's not a superhero. He is a super motivator. And he is motivated our generation to say, why not? Why not create change? Why not be the best generation we can be? Why not, you know, stand up for what we believe in. Why not just be more successful? Why not just try harder? Why not just advocate? Why not just go into Congress and to Capitol Hill and lobby our congresspeople? It's not that hard. And he's done all that. But like I said, he's not a superhero. And so it was funny to me because they were mad that I said racism isn't dead. But it was like in their statements, they were racist to like, one was like niggers are still whining and, um, you know, you're only 23, what do you know about racism or all these different things? And

Speaker 2:          02:26          I just,

Speaker 1:          02:28          it's very interesting to me. So I think, uh, even with Obama in office, we have a long road ahead of people of having to just build intercultural politics and intercultural communication that is more uplifting and uniting. And I think that as a coalition energy action coalition has been working really, really hard to try and develop that as a goal, as a true strategic goal.
