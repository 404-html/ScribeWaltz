Speaker 1:          00:00          The mind is a brain that's conscious. Consciousness is a synonym for subjectivity, and there's a conceptual gap between subjectivity and objective observation, which is what science is. I would actually maintain that there is no scientific way to demonstrate that an entity is conscious. It's only a parent to itself, and my prediction is that we will. This is an objective prediction. We will come to accept entities that are not biological, uh, as conscious, but it's not going to be okay machines on the right side of the room. Humans on the left, if you talked to your biological human, that they will have lots of non biological processes going on in their body and brain. Those computers will be out in the cloud. So the thinking of that person isn't even just in their body and brain. Even in the non biological portion, it's out on the cloud. So it's going to be all mixed up. It's not going to be a clear distinction between human and machine. The bottom line is we are one human machine civilization. This technology is already expanded who we are, and it's going to go into high gear when we get to the steep part of the exponential.
