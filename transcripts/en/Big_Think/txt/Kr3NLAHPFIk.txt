Speaker 1:          00:13          Well, he's young people have been drawn up in the culture of a enormous wealth and enormous power, enormous opportunity, uh, the least well off of them is considerably better than the best of their ancestors. I think they recognize that they see the signs of success as a world defined success and opulence on every hand. They are surrounded by sensation. They're surrounded by violence. They are surrounded by a politics. None of these are capable of delivering the goods. And I think they recognize that and I think there is a desire to find something that will last, something that will do something that will not disappoint and letting you do that in very evidently you attempted to turn back to the elders, to the wisdom of another age, uh, to something that might not seem to have appeal to you in your earlier phase. But your earlier phase you recognize was a deceitful and deceptive one.

Speaker 1:          01:20          You ask Harvard graduates whether all going and they're all going to go. Ninety percent of the seniors in any given class, say they're going into three cities, they're going to go to Washington just to put things right power. They're going to go to New York to make lots of money. Uh, the material world and the going to Los Angeles to have fun fantasy. And I think they've come back from all three of those cities discovering that like ours, there's no there, there a Washington is not going to turn the world right side up. Uh, all the money in New York doesn't spare it. The troubles and tribulations of living in New York and all the fantasy from Lala Latin doesn't dull the pain of living in a life with no meaning and no value. And that's a modest symbol. I think people say, okay, that must be another way. Maybe Jerusalem is the place, uh, maybe a, a, a pilgrimage to the holy city is the place. Maybe some Ashram somewhere, maybe sitting under a Bodhi tree who knows? But there are wiser people than we who years ago have discovered some of these truths. Maybe we even heard them in our youth. And maybe the trick is to try to recapture, recover some of that for ourselves. Now. I think that's part of the excitement.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Well, it's against me that young people are smiling. We think that the, they're not prepared to buy a pig in the poke, that they are not prepared to put up with the, uh, the triumph of the material or limitations that even the most indulgent to facebook, a patron, a under 21 is seeking something that's of value, something of worth, something that will last something that is permanent and even transforming. And I think that has to do, for example, with the fascination with, with, uh, a science fiction with a myth and fantasy. It's the Harry Potter thing. It's looking for something that is ultimately true and good. They are not willing to buy a, the rather grim, a valueless, godless, spiritualists, a universe which some of the elders are quite prepared to sell them. And I think that that suggests a, a great hunger desire, great spiritual movement, uh, among the cleverest and most able of young people they know better than to be content with less than a less than the best. And that's what they're seeking.
