Speaker 2:          00:20          I'm Tom Stemberg. I'm the managing general partner of the highland consumer funds. Without question. A lot of entrepreneurial ideas come out of challenging times. I always say that entrepreneurs are folks who turned adversity into opportunity. A good example of that is right now in the retail space, and I tend to vest in the retail space, you can finally afford to open units in Manhattan. Again, over the past decade, rents were so absurd that unless you had ridiculous price points at obscene gross margins, you couldn't possibly afford to pay the rent. Well, that's changed very dramatically over the last 12 months. And that's unbalanced. I think a good thing. Uh, and we will see lots of great ideas spawned out of this downturn. Engineers who get laid off from big companies are going to start new companies and those kinds of companies are going to change things going into the future. A, B, they in communications between energy and be they in lots of other areas.

Speaker 2:          01:37          Uh, first of all, obviously those entities which are positioned as value brands will do better than those who are perceived as high price or, or having frills to them. So to be clear you want to be there, but having said that, what you don't want to do is begin to move away from your fundamental brand position, just kind of as a temporary fix during a downtime. So what we've seen lots of people do a is during these times say, well, you know, I'm brand x and would I create something called kind of brand x and where they used to sell brand decks to full price retailers and now so it kind of brand x to Walmart and Costco. And then what happens is the full price full service retail say I'm not going to do business with these guys anymore. And next thing you know, they basically destroyed their entire brand equity. And that's happened too often. So you got to be very careful and sticking to what your brand stands for in the consumer's mind.

Speaker 2:          02:46          Well, the generic brands were an outgrowth of the Jimmy Carter stagflation years where the economy was declining. And we combine that with a high double digit, almost 20 percent interest rates. Uh, fortunately we don't face that today, uh, the but inflation was running rampant and I got to be very clear with you that I did not invent generic brands. I copied them if company in France called cuff for a, had created something called Lipo which were so called free products, free from advertising free from expensive marketing, just the fundamentalist. Uh, my boss at jewel, a gentleman named Don Perkins, saw this in Europe and brought it back to his company is say, guys, you got to try this. And some of the, the divisions and the bigger divisions didn't want to run with the idea because they were worried it would cannibalize their private label at lower margins, etc.

Speaker 2:          03:38          I was the head of marketing at star market in boston where we had a very high quality of but a high price reputation. I said, this is a big idea that if we entrepreneurially move forward to this, we could change our price perception overnight. A, therefore we copied it, that we rebranded it. No name brands. [inaudible] a great low cost restaurant in boston called the no name and we figured we live off that we call the no name brands and uh, it turned out to be an overnight success and we didn't have to advertise it because we, all the news media climbing all over it and the prices are so dramatically low what it took care of itself and was a very interesting venture that overtime kind of, you know. Uh, so it's time come and go.

Speaker 2:          04:24          Well, I think there's a couple things that I'd say as I reflect back on my staples career and gosh, there's lots of things I'm incredibly proud of having done, including giving us a leadership position on the internet. One I'm less proud of is how we approach international because frankly we approached international too soon. Uh, Canada was, was worked out well and that was early in. It's close enough. That worked out great. If you go through the historical profit and loss statements, not today, But how they used to be a 10 years ago or so in 15 years ago in Germany and england, and is not a pretty picture. It's extremely hard to take any kind of people intensive business from the United States over to europe and you know, for all our economic problems, I'd argue there's are worse than ours. I mean with their pension obligations and the union structures.

Speaker 2:          05:21          I think actually they have more problems than we do and we got plenty of problems so that the notion you somehow another find growth and prosperity in europe and it's easy or that england is easy because they speak the same language. It is just not true. And uh, I had a colleague at staples named joe vessel. So what a, what a great line. He quoted churchill and saying in england and the us were two countries divided by a common language in the example and england when they were forced to turnover, that means revenues is a good thing. We talked about turnover here in the states. It's a bad thing. I think that indian China harbor nola as difficulties from an expansion for interview than england, Germany arguably they're even more difficult. Having said that, the good news about england, about China and India is you've got explosive growth and growth covers on awful lot of sins.

Speaker 2:          06:18          So even with the chinese growth moderating, it's moderating to still be amongst the fastest, if not the fastest growing economy in the world. Uh, we had terrific success there with staples were invested in the business that's now grown to be a several hundred million dollar business. And uh, I've got lots of friends over there and uh, uh, so I still see tremendous opportunities there, particularly in the consumer segment and in retailing. We see lots of opportunities in China, India, uh, I would characterize it similarly. So having said that, the, uh, if you're a software business, it's probably easier if you're in the retail business. The challenge of dIstribution over there and the fact there's not really road patterns over there. Uh, I think it makes it very, very challenging.

Speaker 2:          07:08          I think the first thing I would advise any chief executive entering these times, and I think interestingly in this time around, you didn't have to advise the ceos, the good ones. People like Christine Day, a little lemon or tommy folio at carmax or fill francis at petsmart, didn't have to be told. They on their own realized that they had to prepare their companies for what could be a calamitous situation. You just didn't know how bad it was going to get and in virtually every case they planned for scenarios that turned out to be far worse than at least we've seen to date. Having done that in first and foremost have insured survival. That's your first job. Once you've gotten to that point and now you see sort of the dust settle and I'm an optimist, so I think that does more or less has settled. Then you now have to become opportunistic very quickly and you almost have to turn it a hundred and 80 degrees and I see these companies now are poisoned themselves to grow. But Christine Day was in New York half of lulu lemon about a week ago and that's very, very exciting company and she came in and basically said to the landlords know, gentlemen, if you follow the following guidelines we have for a new leases going forward, we're now prepared to look at opportunities. But if you still have some of these crazy red ideas that came about, uh, uh, at the beginning of the century, at the end of the last one, just hold onto your property and we'll, we'll, we'll just walk by those for lease signs.
