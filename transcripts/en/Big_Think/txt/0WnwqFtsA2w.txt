Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey there. This is Jason Guts and you're listening to think again. A big thank podcast

Speaker 1:          00:10          since 2008 I think has been bringing you the big ideas in little doses from some of the most creative thinkers around. On the thing again, podcast, we step outside of our comfort zone, surprising our guests and me, your host with unexpected clips from big things, synergy you, archives, ideas that we didn't necessarily come here prepared to discuss. This is the fourth mix tape that I'm doing of some of the highlights of the first year of the show and just time to reflect back and think about where we've been. As you may have noticed if you're following the show, I have a lot of creative writers on. I'm a writer myself and I think a lot about the craft of writing and some of the guests have given our listeners advice that I find incredibly powerful and that stays with me all the time. This episode is an attempt to round up some of those best moments from those most powerful moments. Advice about writer's block, how to work with the creative team, how to deal with success and failure and how to deal with the psychology of being a writer. I hope that you'll find these moments as meaningful as I do. This first segment is from a conversation with the acclaimed playwright and screenwriter, Sir David Hare. He really surprised me. There was a really interesting and unexpected turn in the middle of this conversation that I found delightful and the surprise quip is with Sheila keen talking about the psychology of happened happiness.

Speaker 2:          01:45          If you look at the neuroscience, the way that we're wired has a profound effect on how we hear and respond to feedback. We took a look at three variables that are particularly important in terms of your reaction to feedback. The first is your baseline. It's sort of how happy or unhappy are you in the absence of other events in your life. Where's that level that you come back to? It's a scale of one to 10 some people just live their lives at nine right there, just so unbelievably happy and cheerful about everything. This research comes from looking at lottery winners a year later. They're about as happy or unhappy as they were before they won the lottery. And people who go to jail a year later, they're about as happy or unhappy as before they went to jail. Now we look at the second variable, which is swing. When you get positive or negative feedback, how far off your baseline does it knock you? The same piece of feedback can be devastating for one person and you know, kind of annoying for another. And then the third variable is how long does it take you to come back to your baseline? How long do you sustain positive feeling or how long does it take you to recover from negative feeling so taken together. That's where the big variation in sensitivity comes from. That some people are extremely sensitive and other people are pretty insensitive. Um, or maybe I should

Speaker 3:          03:00          say even keel, but I suppose if you're insensitive, you don't really care what I call you, so it doesn't matter.

Speaker 3:          03:07          So there's a lot in there. Well, there are two principle things, yes. About what she's saying, the feedback thing. Um, I work in the collaborative arts. I choose to be a playwright rather than a novelist or a poet. And therefore for me, collaboration is absolutely essential. If I'm working on a movie set or if I'm in a rehearsal, then the whole day what I have written is put under a degree of scrutiny and the actors in particular will say to me, you think that in the interest of the general story, you have achieved this scene. But let me tell you from my point of view, playing it as one person in this scene, there is not enough for me here. I haven't got what I want or I can't make sense of this change to which I can only respond either by arguing or going back and rewriting in order that the woman or man who's playing this particular part will fit into the general picture and be able to play what they want to play.

Speaker 3:          04:07          In other words, they're going to put it under a scrutiny that maybe you have overlooked in your rush to follow the main narrative through. And so you're making adjustments all the time and you're accepting feedback. My experience is you can do that from a position of confidence. In other words, if you're confident about what the general movement of the play or film is, then there is no end to the amount of input that you're open to because you know that it will not be destructive because you know that the resilience of the basic idea of what you're doing, we'll see you through and the thing can't be damaged by minor adjustments. And if you're working with great actors, as I've spent my life working with some of the greatest actors in the world, you're just crazy not to listen to them because what they're going to bring to it is going to be incredibly useful to you.

Speaker 3:          05:01          So from that point of view, feedback is what I live on. That's, that's my element and opinion. Remember is the element that any creative person has to swim in. In other words, you know, a play doesn't exist until it's put before an audience. And what the audience's opinion is, is what finishes that play off. You know when you, when people want to become actors, young people, I say to them, you think you're going out there and you're going to create other people, it's going to be creative. I said half your job is going to be being judged. How? If your job is going to be out there and sensing that the audience don't like you, are you up for that? Do you have the kind of temperament that is going to be able to cope with the dislike of large numbers of people? You're going to fail in certain roles and when you fail in certain roles in front of people, it's going to be deeply embarrassing. Shaming, humiliating and upsetting. Are you up for that? Are you up for being judged? And that's what working in the collaborative arts involves.

Speaker 4:          06:04          Well, let me ask you this because I understand from your memoir and just from the way you write that you're a sensitive person. You know you are a very sensitive person. So when you were just starting out as a playwright, you know, if somebody had said that to you, if somebody had come and said like, do you have what it takes? Is your skin thick enough? Would you have recoiled in horror and crawled into a corner?

Speaker 3:          06:29          Completely. I, I would. I would not have chosen this job. I had known the degree of judgment that it would involve. I have sat in audiences where the audience is rejected the play and did not want to hear what I wanted to say to them and an extremely pay. It ripped my soul out. It was a night in Seattle where a film of mine was laughed off the screen in 1987 with a test audience to a preview audience. I will never go back to the city of Seattle, but listen in the, in the time available to us. Let's go back to her other point, which is really interesting. The happiness thing. You know that a year later the person who is in jail, is that the same level of happiness that they were before they were in Joe, I'm afraid. I think this is true. When you're young, you have a fantasy that you can change and that you can change your life and you will achieve something and then when you achieve that thing, that will make a significant difference to your contentment index.

Speaker 3:          07:25          In other words, you're driven by fantasy. When you're my age, there is no fantasy left. You know, I am extremely happily married to a completely wonderful woman whom I absolutely adore. My children I adore. Therefore, my private life could not be any happier than says there is no fantasy about my, I do not go to sleep dreaming of meeting some other woman who will transform my life. I adore the person that I am with and can imagine no better do you see, nor will I do. I dream of writing a hit to play. I've written hip place. I know what it feels like. I've lived through it. It doesn't significantly change your life. You still have to start again and try and write the next one. So I feel that what she says about how the sort of basic level of happiness you have in your life, it doesn't really change very much.

Speaker 1:          08:17          One of my favorite conversations was with Turkeys, arguably in most celebrated living novelist or Han Pamuk who won the Nobel Prize for literature. Here he's talking about something I've never really heard a writer discussed before, which is the psychology of sitting down every day to write and how a creative writer should manage that. I find this to be incredible advice and the surprise clip is from psychologist Bessel Vanderkolk on trauma.

Speaker 5:          08:51          Okay.

Speaker 1:          08:51          Psychiatry has always had a complex relationship to trauma.

Speaker 6:          08:56          It started who started off as a discipline that looked at way back in the late 18 hundreds people have very bizarre reactions to trauma and so there's that define hysteria, sort of a some interested and then they put it Kubashen. It's people no longer a large studies theory. First World War breaks out a huge number of charm. It has guys probably had lots to do with the rise of Nazism. And then in 1947 the last book about war charm, it gets published and there's nothing til 1982 or something. So it takes a long time. Very psychiatry really doesn't want to see trauma. And in the current Dsm, the people called the Bible of Psychiatry, now we live with via diagnoses like oppositional defiant disorder where people don't ask, why did this kids come become defiance? Bipolar disorder cause being mentally unstable going up and down at the emotions and psychiatry does video what to look at, what's behind there. And as a consequence, the, instead of looking at social conditions as being at the origin of these disorders, uh, these kids get dragged up last year in the u s kids got 18 point $1 billion versus secretary we drugs and these drugs do calm people down. But they also work on the reward system in the brain and decrease curiosity, openness, experimentation, engagement with people. So the neglect of the issue of trauma in the u s in particular is a very serious public health issue.

Speaker 7:          10:38          For me, the biggest traumas of life is of course unrequited love. My Normal Museum of innocence is extensively about the illusions of flow. I chronicle upper middle class, Turkish men's obsession infatuation. It is twice removed. Cousin, just like a trauma, he can never get out of it. He's ridiculed and made fun of, and a trauma means you are almost in a war. Your panic, you don't know what to do. You want to survive and you lack that sense of logic that will control and heal you and perhaps paved the way out of a traumatic situation. My understanding of a trauma is that you want to get out of a situation, but yet you're so much pressure that your mind does not give you the clue out of that kafkaesque way out of that problem. Lau is like that. Perhaps psychology psychiatrist should focus about Lao treated as that trauma.

Speaker 7:          11:47          I am against all this glorification, sugar rising, put them on a pedestal. The idea of love is a sweetie. I agree. It's the sweetest thing, but it all comes with a bad package of trauma, longing, jealousy, anger, miscommunication, self obsession, making you not see the whole picture. I'm a writer in, I want to be, I'm a self conscious writer, a writer who wants to know the effects of what he or she is doing, but also there is one side to me that makes me survive. Perhaps that is letting things go and just following the music that is spontaneously coming inside of me. Colors, notes, verge that I'm possessed with Indian. If you write every day like me, sit on a table everyday traumas and vanish perhaps because I know that life will be hard if I brought working in an office. I choose the life of the solitary artist writing every day, which avoids me from the pressures and traumas of everyday life, but it's inimitable.

Speaker 7:          13:02          Life is in the end. Daily life. I mean you are working hard. You create a structure, you sit down every day, you have a discipline, so somehow those structures are sufficient. Then you don't have to worry as much about trying to control the rest. I argued that a creative writer professor should teach more about this than what should be the plot. What should be the, because normative structural policies about writing fiction is less important than teaching. The would be writer, how to behave in life, how to take easy, the regular systematic traumas, writing blogs, unhappiness, money, happiness, and depressive slowing down. Being a writer is more about minding your mental health, navigating according to your moods, what section chapter of the book you should write first because it's appropriate to your moods now, what to do when you're blocked and how to skip one chapter, skip one trauma, skip one problem and continue.

Speaker 7:          14:17          I understand that psychiatry address traumas I taught, they were already doing that. I taught by the people we're going to people and paying money and because they had traumas. Now I learned they go for other reasons. I would go to a psychiatrist because I had a trauma. If I were to fall in love and never get out of Logan field that I'm hurt or if I'm blocked by my writing and feel that I'm scared of something. I had traumas, political representative traumas. In the past. In the end they gave me nightmares, but the long run, they just pass away. If you are busy with something that makes you happy and it writing, writing, writing, Oh yes, gave me lots of problems. But in the long run, I achievement of finishing something and being like a child, playing with his toys, being busy with all the time, sols, all the traumas of two worlds.

Speaker 7:          15:13          I want to ask you like when you sit down and your brain isn't working that day, does that happen? Whenever, boy, then what do you do? Hemingway has a nice advice. He said at the end of today, if you know what you're going to write, don't write the last sentence. Keep it for the next morning. So start with that sentence. Once you write a beautiful sentence, that sentence will tell you what will be the next, what will be the next, what will be the next? When you're writing fiction, if you're in it eight sentence, you have a magic feeling that it's unfolding on his own. You look a lot of your window. You look at say New York silhouette or Bosphorus that I see from my window and my mind as if processed because I'm so deeply in it. You continue like that. Eh? I think if you work three hours a day, if you write three pages, if you work nine hours a day, you write not nine pages but 18 pages.

Speaker 7:          16:16          Once creativity goes up exponentially, once you devote your life whole life to it, even your sleep to it. The way to get out of our traumas in fact is to invent a second world fictive world or artistic world that will avoid the trauma, but perhaps going to a psychiatrist who understands you, maybe something, but then maybe you can try it anymore. Yes. This is the thing that my friends always tell me or and I see you're traumatized. I can give you this pill, but maybe tomorrow are feel happy and that you cannot write again. Is that sent through contradiction in my life? Perhaps because I'm happy I cannot write perhaps because I'm so unhappy I can write. These are reasonable contradictions. I think a writer's life has all of these variations, but in the end, sailing with good Ville and bleeding in the wind is the essential and you sell on and on and on and on, and I'm writing fiction for the last 40 years. After 40 years of sailing, I have a sense that this wind will take me a twit. Nice, quiet, good, beautiful place. I trust them in and sail and sail and right then right

Speaker 7:          17:44          earlier this year, I sat down with author James McBride, who won the book award

Speaker 1:          17:50          for the color of water to talk to him about his memoir or biography investigation into the life of James Brown. Here. He brings up his recent experiences in what must have been one of the most interesting writers rooms ever. The surprise quip is from journalists, Charles Duhigg, who wrote the power of habit talking here about creative teams.

Speaker 2:          18:19          About five years ago, Google started this interesting experiment. They wanted to figure out how to build the perfect team and so what they did is they started collecting huge amounts of data about all the teams within Google. The teams that at a glance look most productive oftentimes aren't. But if you can create this conversational turn taking equality of voices, if you can convince people to really listen to each other by being sensitive to the nonverbal cues were giving off, then you create psychological safety and psychological safety is the single greatest determinant in whether a team comes together or whether it falls apart. One of my favorite examples of psychological safety and a team really come to coming together is the early days of Saturday night live. So when you think about it on Saturday night live, never should have worked, right? You have a bunch of Comedians who are kind of misanthropes to begin with, and yet for some reason when Lauren michaels put them in a room together, everyone was willing to kind of get along.

Speaker 2:          19:19          They, they were willing to put aside their ego and create this amazing show together. Not only an amazing show, but a show that was put together under these incredible time pressures, right? They have a week to put together a live show. And when I talked to the early writers and performers on Saturday night live and I asked them why this happened. All of them said the same thing because of Lorne michaels. So Lauren Michaels has this very unique way of running meetings. He sits down and the meeting starts and what he'll do is he'll make everyone go around the table and say something, and if someone hasn't spoken up in a little while, Lauren michaels will actually stop the meeting and he'll say, Susie, I noticed that you haven't chimed in. Like what are you thinking about right now? And it all works out, but it's because he creates an environment that feels safe, where everyone feels like they can speak up and they feel like everyone else is genuinely listening to them because they're sensitive to all the cues that they're sending.

Speaker 8:          20:19          I think that kind of analysis is a dream killer for me because I think when you analyze stuff too much you, the next thing you know it's like, you know, analyzing sex. I mean we should we write a report when we're done check lists of, you know, two phones, one to five. How did you, how was it? I mean, yeah, I, I think that kind of thinking is dangerous for the creative process. Like if you come in with that method and no, I mean, whatever method of following. No. Yeah, I wouldn't, I mean, look, I wouldn't fall, what's his name? Lorne. Lorne michaels. I wouldn't find his method. I'd follow my method. Everybody has a different solar as different way of singing that song. I think the collaborative process, which is really what the journalist is talking about is dictated by what you need to create and who's in the room.

Speaker 8:          21:06          And so that process works for that particular group of people given the time constraints that exist. I don't know that that would work. If you are writing for a six part mini series like I did. Uh, I was one of the writers in a six part mini series for David Simon and creative. The wire has an area that's called the parting the waters. It's about Taylor branch is three book series about the civil rights movement. I'll be watching myself, ta-nehisi codes, tail brands, David Simon. Now we're going there. What was it like being in a writing room with David Simon and Tanahashi and like how did that go? Well, it was great. I mean, uh, that work. Like it was free. I mean, David didn't point that. She wouldn't say, what are you thinking? You know, he did it a different way and he said, uh, you know, we have to decide which story we're going to tell and who's going to tell it.

Speaker 8:          21:56          He's like, count base, you know? I mean, he's like Duke Ellington, me, like Duke Ellington had a band of great soloists and he'd say, this is the composition. Now put your thing to it. David is the same way. You know, he says this, these are the parameters. You're, you're all small little kings and your kingdom. Let's bring our kingdoms together and see which one of us can come up with the best idea. Whoever has the best idea, we'll run with that. So you can't bring a lot of ego into a room like that. You have to be at, you're there to serve as a story and a good writer will serve as the story. A good musician will serve as the music. As a novelist, how do you work? Do you plot out everything before you write or, and you just, no, I don't. I have no standard way of doing it other than getting up at four o'clock in the morning and getting to work.

Speaker 8:          22:42          You can, you can write at four o'clock in the morning. Okay, well I, I, you know, I go to bed at nine all right, if I go to bed at 11 I get up at four o'clock anyway. I'll take a nap at 11:00 AM until, you know, I mean, the discipline of music taught me how the necessity of practice. But going back to your earlier statement about this room full of writers, if you're a real serious writer, you, you are a servant to the story you writing chooses you, you don't choose it. So when you're working with other writers, you have to service the idea. And that's really where craft comes into the trade shows itself because then you have to be able to throw left handed in Bat, right handed a bat right hand and throw left handed. Right? You have to be able to, you have to be able to hit a curve ball in the bottom of the seventh, two out in guy on base. You just have to be able to do it because if you don't, you bring in the whole team down. So you have to learn how to play every position. You're a person who's collab and you've done musics and you've collaborated with other people. You've done theater. Tanahashi has written a comic book just now. Uh, you know, so there's a, just, I think of like some of these folks, you know, William Faulkner,

Speaker 1:          23:46          you know, the folks like sitting alone in their room for their whole lives would probably freak out if they suddenly had to share the table.

Speaker 8:          23:52          Prob more maybe, maybe. I mean, but I must say that writing is a lonely life. And so working with other writers in this particular situation was just a lot of fun. And my problem is that at my age, you know, I walk into a room and I started talking to people get intimidated. They think that, you know, I know what I'm talking about. You know, I'm, I'm, I reached the point in my life where I don't really feel like I'm not, I stopped working hard at trying to make people feel comfortable if they can't accept me on my own terms, just to, you know, they'll see shortly that it's cool and if they don't, then there's nothing I, nothing I write or play or do is going to make them feel comfortable anyway. So I didn't have that problem when I was working with David and Eric overmeyer tiny he seen and Taylor branch, right? They were just cool. We were all there for the same purpose and I really liked them all.

Speaker 1:          24:48          And I ended in early, earlier mix tape with a spontaneous monologue from one of my favorite writers, Howitt and rapper kate tempest. But the whole conversation with her, it was incredibly illuminating. She had just finished her first novel, the bricks that built the houses. And here she talks fascinatingly about writer's block. The surprise clip is from author Augusten burroughs. He's talking about writer's block, which he believes is a real thing and we'll see how kate responds to that.

Speaker 3:          25:25          The worst thing to do with writer's block is kind of like the worst thing to do with back pain. You know, if you have back pain, you don't want to stay in bed for the next five years. You know you need to begin physical therapy. You need to maybe do yoga or [inaudible]. You need to move with writer's block. You don't stay away from the writing and think, I'll wait until the solution comes to me because that's not how it works for a writer. The solution comes to us as we're writing. It comes mid sentence. The solution to writer's block is to write about the writer's block. Why don't you have it? Why does it suck? Really, why it could be a case of you knows you're off plot. We're off point. It could be that there's something deeper, better, truer jucier that you really need to write about that maybe you're too embarrassed to write.

Speaker 9:          26:21          I'm of the opinion that there is no such thing as writer's block. I don't think it exists. I think that there is the fear of writing badly. That's, that's what it is. And if you're afraid of writing badly, then and you're not going to be writing because it's a, it's a crippling fear that, but you just have to take that fear away from it until you saw the flower. I love this shit today. It doesn't matter. Right? It doesn't matter if it's good like because the point of it is right. Anyone can have an idea anybody but finishing an ideas what I'm saying? That's the agony. That's difficult. It's always difficult. It's fucking hard work and apologies for swearing, but the point is, is that like you're, you're kind of in competition with yourself already because you're trying to improve. You're trying to be better tomorrow than you were yesterday.

Speaker 9:          27:05          That's one thing. But having an idea, beautiful, perfect. It's going to be, you know, it's going to change the world. That's going to be the best thing you've ever done to the actual finished thing is going to be clunky. You're going to be ashamed of it. You're going to pick it apart. We're getting, you can't get to sleep. You're going to hate yourself for doing it. That's the point. That's why you move on and have another idea. You finish things, you finished things. The stepping stones towards finding your voice. It's like on on a writing day. If I don't feel, if it's not happening, if it's not coming out, I don't, I don't force it. I take a walk, like I stopped, like I'm in a slightly different situation because I'm usually, I'm usually quite up against it with deadlines. So I wrote the majority of this has it fixed, it built the houses, kind of what I was on the road.

Speaker 9:          27:48          Sorry. So in a tour bus full of other people? Yeah, and it's all boss or in a cafe or in a service station or like in the three days I had off between tours in my bedroom or whatever it was like, and the thing is like you can make all kinds of excuses that you can say, oh I need some space and I need time and I need natural light. And I need a room with a view and I need, or you can just, you know, you can just finish it. It's really hard, but it's what, it's what will make you better. Say you don't take a walk and say you sit down and you make yourself right one day and it comes out and it's shit. You delete it. Do you rewrite it? It depends what you're working on. So I feel if I'm working on a play, you can hear, you can feel when it's a bad line, it's suddenly you're like, what?

Speaker 9:          28:34          Nobody would ever say that about this character would never say that. But the thing is when, when I'm up against the deadline or usually it's, I'm under a lot of pressure because of my schedule because I mean that's the way I work and I'm happy about it. It's good for me. But sometimes there isn't time to be having an off day and that's like, it's crazy pressure but it works. Sometimes it works. Other times I'm in a really great situation because writing can be quite lonely pursuit. But then when you have an editor or in music, I have a great music producer who I work with or what are making theater or I have the director, I worked with a director and there were these other people, these kind of midwives that populate a writer's life that help you to kind of get over yourself enough to just kind of deliver it, you know?

Speaker 9:          29:16          And um, you know, with, with this, for example, with the bricks, the most exhilarating part of this process was deleting 30,000 words and feeling how good that was. Like suddenly it got lighter and it kind of held its shape a bit more successfully. And I could just feel this thing that I'd only ever heard writers talk about, but I'd never experienced, which is like the kind of joy of just cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting and just watching it kind of grow. Yeah. Really interesting. So yeah, shout out loud as shit. It'll stay there for a bit and then you lose it. It's all right, you know?

Speaker 4:          29:49          Yeah. So it sounds like a big part of your process is kind of the gun to your head, like just saying, basically I got to get this done and putting yourself in a position where that's the case.

Speaker 9:          29:57          Yeah. And even before when there wasn't deadlines, when I have no publisher or anything else, I was still inflicting that kind of pressure on myself because I've always felt that time is kind of against me. I don't know why then if he feel like that.

Speaker 4:          30:09          Yeah. Well increasingly, but uh, for me it was interesting because I, I grew up relatively privileged and had the privilege slash curse of being able to kind of wander around and like, it took me longer to feel that the gun of time to my head. Yeah. And I mean, I don't know much about your background, but um, I know from the fact that so much of the press is about your being from southeast London and the neighborhood that you focus on and stuff. I'm guessing you may be, didn't have people sending you off to wander around.

Speaker 9:          30:44          I didn't get some really good supportive environment, but the, the way that south London figures in my work and then in myself, it's like, it's such a huge Paul. I mean, because if you grow up in a big city, especially in a pot in a city that's so south London, it, okay, so I suppose for an American audience to kind of say, oh, southeastern, then it probably doesn't mean anything. Like, you know, unless you've spent some time and none of them, but the kind of character of it in my head, the way that it is a very creative place in terms of people who are really making something happen there. I felt in my, it's very mixed place culturally, racially, and economically, lots of different people live in very close together. There's a certain sensibility that it gives you if you're from there, which is, it's quite a rough area.

Speaker 9:          31:34          It was like the highest, the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and murder amongst teenagers when I was growing up in Lewisham, which is the borrower, I'll go up, but at the same time there's a huge amount of music and huge amount of amazing, vibrant creativity and I found it to be a really positive place. I grew up in a very good home. My Dad was a lawyer, my mom was a teacher. We just lived in this area that was like full of full of life, you know, it was just full of life and every time I walked out of the door and down the street, every time I ever went anywhere, I would pass by thousands if not fucking tens of thousands of people because it's London, it's a big city, and I just always felt so close to life, you know, it was just everywhere. And that I have a huge love for people like the rubber, not so obvious to say, but I'm really moved by just like being amongst strangers and feeling connected to their humanity and feeling this thing I'm talking about earlier.

Speaker 9:          32:28          What about this kind of current reality that we are denied access to? I think there is something about a kind of a frequency that our rights are exists on looking for the kind of looking, the internal experience of strangers. You know, I don't really know why, but yeah, I watched somebody walk down the street and the way that they're carrying their, their car keys, something about the way they just dropped their shopping bag. Like I feel so blown away by a tiny movement, right? They kind of sends me into this like deep passion for these people, you know, for, for somebody. And I think that the writer is constantly feeling kind of outside of life, which is what sends us to the page often, you know, trying to write ourselves into this existence that we were kind of constantly because we observed so much I kind of outside of things. But the observation is one of like pure love. Really. Yeah. I got, I got lost in south London and I found myself there but you know, got into all kinds of trouble and all kinds of like beautiful, beautiful things happened. And I still live there and it's still home.

Speaker 4:          33:26          You know in the book there's, you talk about gentrification and there's this sense, I mean it seems like you feel like the heart of south London is still intact, but that there's this threat somehow of it being co opted or,

Speaker 9:          33:43          yeah. It's strange because the, I think it's more helpful because this conversation about gentrification, it happens all over the world and it's a tragedy. But the minute where I've been thinking about it is it's more useful actually need to pan out of this a little bit and think about what this means it in a kind of why the framework, which is this kind of symptomatic greed and the exploitation of land for profit above people and this year you could, okay, yes, it's, it's a real shame shaft on this changing. My God, it hurts. But if we pan out a little bit and we think about land, land is being exploited for profit, the people that live on that land are being destroyed. The community is that culture has been destroyed. This isn't just happening in cities, it's just happening all over the world. It's happening to the first Australians. It's happening in the rainforest and primitive, you know, it's like there is a greed that is running, running the world. Yeah, it's greed. There's no empathy and I

Speaker 4:          34:39          alienation happens not only to the communities that are destroyed but to the destroyers as well. I mean, I just think that the world that is built up upon the wreckage of these communities is also a world in which it's difficult to form community like new communities.

Speaker 9:          34:57          There are, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I've never lived in a, I don't know. I think that like this has to go both ways. So if I say that, you know, I love people and I'm, I'm for people, I can't be just for people that I already agree with, like this has to go both ways. You have to, recently I've been thinking, okay, so you need to empower even the very powerful to be more real with themselves that actually think about the cost. The only thing I can think to say is just empathy. It does need more empathy. It's very easy for artists,

Speaker 4:          35:32          a buddy to basically cut themselves off from all the rest of that humanity and find some way to people and say like, oh, that person is to, you know, that's a greedy corporate person, or that's a this person or that, you know what I mean? Like I think it's hard for anyone to to remind themselves and try to figure out how to like

Speaker 9:          35:52          not shutoff difficult because part of me just recoils and kind of wishes that the world was kind of run by these reptilian monsters. The reality is that the human beings are human beings that are making these decisions. And so at the beginning of this conversation we were talking about, you know, whether this kind of grappling between what we're capable of and what we are inherent nature is. And actually what I believe that inherently we are physiologically empathic beings. Right. That was, that was a study that that took place where I learned about this in the Science Museum in London. So I know it's true, right? So they took two strangers, put them in a, in a room, separated by a glass partition. And one of them stood on a block of ice and the temperature of the others, the temperature of the other person's feet dropped in response to watching another human being who they didn't know stand on a block of ice. Like our bodies are chained into each other's. It's like if I see like I see your wound on you, I will recoil, it will hurt me at some level. Right.

Speaker 4:          36:54          We have to learn. People have to learn not to be able to do that, you know?

Speaker 9:          36:59          Right. Yeah. But so like, but we've kind of fed this thing about Humana being this like inherently like aggressive, competitive, selfish. I don't believe that. I think that that is something that has encouraged this kind of myth of the individual, which is very helpful for capitalism, but not very helpful for humanity. You know? I mean fierce

Speaker 4:          37:20          to be a pretty strong forest within humanity as well. And it seems to me that a lot of this stuff arises from fear, right? I mean, the primal fear goes all the way back, right? I mean, we're, we're afraid of death, you know, is probably where it begins. I don't know. But fear of scarcity, fear of whatever, like fear of somebody taking what's ours. I don't know. I think it's probably pretty old.

Speaker 9:          37:42          Yeah, I'm, no, I'm with the you and I think, I think yes of course. But like once you are, sounds so kind of far fetched and also so easy. But this is kind of where I'm at at the minute is if you're, if you're there, if you're present with yourself and suddenly like the, the worry of things, the anxiety of things to come. This is not important because you're just, you're just where you are, you know, and you can deal with it when it comes. But I don't know. I don't know. I'm a sudden he was about to say something extremely kind of new agey and I stopped myself. I still feel something else. Okay, good. Next subject.

Speaker 4:          38:21          And that's it for this. Think again, mixed tape, which I'm calling the writer's room gathering some of the most poignant and interesting advice that I've heard some writers on writing over the past year. If you're listening and liking the, you're probably sick of

Speaker 1:          38:36          hearing me say it, and I wish that I could personally remove this message from all the future episodes of everyone who has gone and done this. But at any rate, I can't. If you could go and read or review the show on Itunes, stitcher, wherever it is you're listening, it really doesn't take very long and it makes a major difference in terms of the shows sustainability. We have an amazing season coming up now that it's fall, and I hope to see you next week.
