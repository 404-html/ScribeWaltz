Speaker 1:          00:07          I don't think so, some of the basic outlook as it would be that people are monkeys with large brains, period. And uh, that's the way you have to think about it. Um, it, it, it does, it does make me cynical about human motivation and it, it makes me think, you just have to be very practical, very realistic. I don't, I don't have, I don't, I don't put any, any faith in a utopian. A drain was, I don't think people are basically good or anything like that. Um, you know, the promises of politicians and the, and the Bologna that judges spew out and their opinions.

Speaker 1:          01:05          I think when one wants to, Oh, uh, uh, have a caustic view of, of, of people, of all people, you know, you have to be no recognize if it's severe problems with criminality. We also have problems with a no abuse of authority and, and with a mistreatment of all sorts of people and overextension of criminal laws, excessive criminal sentences. So the, the, the problems are everywhere. I, I very much dislike the extremes of left and right. Um, and anything that is faith based, whether it's religious or whether it's a, I mean they, you know, the left there just as religious, they don't have a god, my sister's religious in the sense that it's a, that is based on faith rather than fact. So I think we should always be trying to, you know, penetrate to the level of fact. Now the criticism of this, of the pragmatic position is that it's not enough to know what the facts are.

Speaker 1:          02:20          I know what the consequences are because they have to be valued. You can't, you know, there's a disjunction between, isn't you can infer a lot from as I agree with that, but, but there is a degree of consensus and society. So they didn't actually know the consequences of, um, of particular policies, uh, that most people will be brought to because there's a basic moral man. I don't like moralistic vocabulary, moralistic reasoning. But obviously there is more, there are people have moral feelings, they do react to things. So you know, if everything was known about abortion, who gets it, why there are other ways of preventing that, this and that. The other thing, he really understood it. I think we would get most people, not 100 percent, but maybe 60 percent would think, yes, this is what and how is she.
