Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, I, I always love working with which scorsese because, um, he, he had the confidence to know, unlike a lot of directors, he had the confidence, you know exactly what he wanted and he said, okay, you're the writer, give me this. And he didn't fret over it. He just went off and, you know, set up his shots and, you know, you sort of trusted me to deliver the goods. A lot of guys are like so anxious that they never know what they want and you get caught in the middle. Um, you get into power plays between actors and directors and you know, you fit, you, you know, you feel like a secretary. What a dog collar on. Um, but I never, you know, which Scorsese, you know, it was like, he just knew exactly what he wanted and you know, it was a breeze. I mean, it's never easy, but it was relatively, it was a breeze.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Other people I worked with that I really liked is a David Simon and, and the crew around the wire. Uh, the only reason to do that show other than you sure don't do it for the money. I mean, you open up the envelope and um, you know, moths fly out. But, um, you do it cause it's the wire and it was, it seemed like a, like a group of peers, although it wasn't cause Simon was to create her, he and Ed Burns, you know, they, they, they were the writer, producer, creator is always the guy that rewrites everything and is in control. But given that there was none of the Games, uh, it was me and Pelicano Pelecanos and Lehane and, and Ed Burns and David Simon. And I felt like when we were all together, you know, there was, there was a, a sobriety, you know, of purpose, um, and, and a mutual sympathy and respect, you know, for each other's work that I rarely find in, in, in, in group situations like movie making. And it was just a great show. I'm, although I frankly, it was so hard, I didn't even understand my own scripts most of the time, but, you know, I did, you know, did what I was told, you know, and then some. And, uh, I was just really proud to be part of that, you know.
