Speaker 1:          00:05          In China, there are basically two major issues. The first issue is that there is not a lot of intellectual property enforcement on the streets or in the web rooms on, so there's a that you can find pirated material all over China and there's not been a very effective way of enforcing that. We're working on that, but it's very, very slow. The second problem is market access. The Chinese were severely restrict the amount of foreign product, including American product, a film product that comes into China illegally, and I'm not only is that bad in and of itself, but then encourages more pirated material to to be on the streets because you can find almost anything that has ever been produced in the history of the human race in China that's on the streets illegally.
