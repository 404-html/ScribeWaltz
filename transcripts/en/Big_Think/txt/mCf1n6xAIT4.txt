Speaker 1:          00:08          It really depends who you are and sort of what you've done. I think a lot of people, um, what did they say? A perfection is the enemy of the good or something like that. I think a lot of people will put the stuff off because they want to do the right thing. And I think logically the way to approach your own personal, uh, situation in terms of the environment is to take some time to a carbon calculator, figuring out where you have the most impact, focus on those things first, et cetera. I think the, the challenge with that is that people may put that off and put that off because it's a big thing. They just want to do it right and they want to be sure. So I, I try to counsel people just, just get started, pick something. It doesn't really matter what, pick something that matters to you and that just feels right and just start and I think that gets you on the path.

Speaker 1:          01:00          And then, you know, if you want to be more strategic, great, by all means get up, get on one of those carbon calculators, figure out where you can have your impact and sort of do that. So, um, I think that's, I've met, that's a big one. I think in terms of general concepts, there's a very, very simple one, just small is sexy and it just apply. It applies to, I say in Jasper applies to everything. Like we just, we have this perception that we need a lot of things or, or, or volume or what have you in order to be happy and we've just don't. So whether it's architecture, you know that the houses have gone from some close to a thousand square feet and like 50 years ago to close to two and a half, literally two and a half times as big while the fat average family size has shrunk.

Speaker 1:          01:49          Oh, it's not like we are a lot happier now than we were in the 50s. So you can live a great life and, and um, in a, in a much smaller home. And, and by doing that, because the space is much smaller, you save on heating, you save on cooling, you see save on lighting, you save on furnishing. And it just makes for an overall simpler life. So I think focused on small smells great. And that can be cars, that can be architecture, that can be the size of your wardrobe, that can be the, your number of, uh, we can John's via plane. But I think just, just focus on that.

Speaker 2:          02:33          I think if we were, if we were very vocal with both our dollars

Speaker 1:          02:40          in terms of what, what products and services we're willing to support and what not, um, and in terms of the political process, I think that that in itself can have a tremendous impact because it also impacts the people around you. So it sort of covers the consumer and the personal aspect it sends a message to and sends a message to, uh, to, to government. So I think if we were a lot more vocal and a lot less concerned about what other people

Speaker 2:          03:08          thought, I think that.
