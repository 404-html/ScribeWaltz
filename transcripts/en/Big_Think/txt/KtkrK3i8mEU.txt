Speaker 1:          00:08          There were several steps along the way. I went to college at overland and Ohio and after that I went to Boston and then after a couple of years there I went to Grad School in Arizona in Tucson at the University of Arizona and I stayed there seven years and I met a woman who is entering the Grad program just as I was leaving and she was from Pakistan, her name's asthma. Awesome. Han. And we ended up getting married and then after staying another year in Arizona, after her graduation was she, we were both eager to go somewhere and try something different. Um, she had just come into the country to go to university and then Grad school, so she wasn't, you know, it wasn't an immigration thing or something. So we looked around, we applied for jobs overseas. We ended up going to Morocco for three years as English teachers. And uh, that was, that was interesting.

Speaker 2:          01:19          Well,

Speaker 1:          01:22          my world view of the states has been slowly changing over time, but yes, there is nothing like leaving the country to help you look back and see the country more clearly. And there's nothing like living with people who are quite skeptical about the intentions of your country to make you think about that. Um, however, I have to say that I'm just on a personal level both in Morocco and then in then people are incredibly friendly and hospitable and interested and kind of this idea that they're all just raving lunatics a like you see on the cover of Newsweek is simply not true. It's a lie is a lie designed to make you stay home. And so yes, many people have very strong opinions about Israel, Palestine. They think that Israel gets billions of dollars per year, which it does, and the Palestinians get nothing and the it money is being used for repression and so forth. That's a legitimate political opinion to have. Does this mean that they walk up to me and beat me up on the street? No, it does not. And that I wish that, um, perception could change.
