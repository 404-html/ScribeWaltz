Speaker 1:          00:04          Feeling which are socially isolated, it's related to being physically isolated from other people, but it's not the same thing. One can be lonely in a marriage, lonely in a family, they can be lonely in a crowd. So we found it isn't the number of contacts or the frequency of interaction with other people. It's the quality of those interactions. Freshmen who have gone to college find themselves among many, many other people, lots of social activities. They go to mixers and they look out. Everyone else is talking with other people and they're sitting there all alone in their head and so that actually can make their feeling of isolation greater for that moment. So being around other people, that's not what makes people less lonely. It's feeling connected.

Speaker 2:          00:45          Tell other people that makes them feel less lonely. Traditionally, loneliness and depression,

Speaker 1:          00:55          loneliness and anxiety with treated as very similar constructs. So much so that one of the common measures of depression that used in epidemiology has. As one of the questions, do you feel lonely? Uh, our own researcher, Mr Trump, others have looked at whether loneliness and depression to the same thing. And we find them to be separate contracts, they're separate. Mental states are longitudinal research and our experimental research has shown that loneliness leads to increased depressive symptomatology. So if no matter how depressed you are today, if you're feeling lonely today, you will be more depressed a year from now, above and beyond what your level of depression today would predict because of the loneliness. We also find that depression leads you to withdrawal, so at difference in depression and loneliness, loneliness makes you want to reach out and contact other people, be a part of that group, be a part of that relationship.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Depression is associated with depressed an effect, but also with lethargy, kind of this withdrawal from others, and indeed with depression, we find over time people do withdraw from others and that withdrawal and the increased stress associated with that leads them to field lonelier. So you have this pernicious feedback loop below maynard. They are, the more depressed they become, the more depressed they are, the more they withdraw and the lonelier they become. If you look at those two effects of the effect of loneliness and depression is stronger than the effect of depression on loaning us. People can be depressed for other reasons and feeling lonely, but many people who go in to seek treatment for depression at the root of the problem is their feeling of disconnection and isolation and unless that's treated, the depression or any attempt to fix that is really just kind of a transient bandaid. It's not getting at the root problem.

Speaker 2:          02:46          The measurements of loneliness is

Speaker 1:          02:49          somewhat not obvious. Bob People know that they feel isolated, they feel disconnected. They don't have others on whom they can rely or talk, but it's mostly they don't have a confidant. They don't have anyone who affirms who they are. That's part of it. Now, if you ask people, do they feel lonely? There tends to be this stigma associated with loneliness. I think our research has suggested it's an inappropriate stigma, but there's nevertheless the stigma associated with the loneliness, so people underreport. If you ask them, do you feel lonely? They under report, but if you ask them, are there others, son whom they can rely to, whom they can relate to and whom they can confide a. that's when you start to see people admitting this feeling of isolation. There's also this sense in which they don't have a collective identity, so immediately after nine slash 11 when we all survived that tragedy, it made being an American salient.

Speaker 1:          03:42          That's a social identity, but if you notice in this country, journalists were writing about the harmony, the goodwill that existed in America. That was a step up of what had been felt weak before nine slash 11. That's part of being connected and so that alone, the individual is also absent that social identity, and it may be in the form of feeling like you're an American after a tragedy or it might be a Chicago cubs are New York Yankees Fan. These kinds of identities are part of how we are connected to other other individuals and other groups and loamy individuals tend to lock those as well.

Speaker 1:          04:20          There are several secrets to overcoming or avoiding moments I. I like to use the analog of of hunger. A loneliness has evolved because it has very adaptive purpose. We are fundamentally social species, but we need some signal when that important need isn't being met. Very much like hunger. We need a reasonable level of blood sugar or else we don't have the metabolic resources, the energy to pursue foraging and other activities. Uh, when we start to have lower blood sugar levels, we become hungry, uh, and that's a signal that we should find food and eat and refuel. If we ignore that hunger signal. If we think that somehow that stigmatizing, and so we simply persisted not pursuing any food. And ignoring that signal, we can become so depleted of energy that we're no longer able to seek that food so it can become chronic and deadly.

Speaker 1:          05:20          Loneliness is very much like that man. Instead of sustaining us with calories, it seemed sustains us with connections in evolutionary times. We were not able to fend off large wild beasts very well as individuals with the stick. Nor are we able to take care of our offspring who had the longest period of abject dependency of any species. If we were simply solitary animals, we are able to achieve a reproduction survival and our offspring survive long enough so that they to reproduce a because we acted as a group as a collective. So find yourself ostracized or separated from that group is a threatening dangerous circumstance. Recognizing that you also can understand how the feeling of loneliness, the pain of loneliness, the threat that's associated with loneliness is a signal very much like hunger, but it's there to cue the need to reconnect, to protect that part of our, our existence. Uh, and if we respond to it, is that cute? Then it can be very healthy. If you don't respond to that queue, then you can fall into the grips of chronic loneliness. And that has been, as I suggested, very deleterious mental psychological effects, but also physiological effects.
