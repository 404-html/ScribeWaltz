Speaker 1:          00:05          Um, well, it would involve work.

Speaker 2:          00:13          I'm matt and it would probably involve pasta and wine. I can have wine in my last meal. Right. Absolutely. So, um, I had an amazing Harlan cab the other night. I'd have a harland cab and I'd have like a really amazing was on yeah. With beef, pork, veal, and um, you know, with Mozzarella. And it would be Julie and a rich and a really filling, and you know what? I wouldn't be able to eat the last bite and that would be great. That would be my hope.

Speaker 1:          00:46          Last thought. I'm falling happy.
