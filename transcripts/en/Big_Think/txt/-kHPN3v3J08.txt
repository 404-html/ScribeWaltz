Speaker 1:          00:08          With next generation technologies, we have the ability to replace the petroleum we use today in our vehicles with advanced biofuels. Those technologies require years to develop and literally hundreds of millions of dollars of investment in order for that investment to occur. In order for that R and d to actually happen, there needs to be a conventional biofuels industry from which to evolve. Today's conventional biofuels industry provides exactly that platform and we anticipate over the next decade that that transformation will occur and that next generation, sustainable biofuels will become the norm rather than the exception.
