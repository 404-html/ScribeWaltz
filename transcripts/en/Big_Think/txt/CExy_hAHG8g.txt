Speaker 1:          00:06          I'm Peter, I'm founder and CEO of line too. That's a great question. I think the first thing is don't quit your day job until you've done real diligence on the idea. And what I mean by that is, is really look at the market, look at where the market is headed, look at the trends, look at the competitive landscape and, and try to play a few strategic moves into the future to see is this something that's ultimately going to be dominated by x big company or why big company. That's not always a reason to say no, but it's certainly something you want to look at. And then, um, and then make sure you have a business model and you know, how you're gonna make money and then, you know, bounce it off. A few smart people, but not too many. Um, people you really trust. But we'll be honest with you.

Speaker 1:          00:55          And if it passes all of those tests, then you should ignore everyone else that tells you it's a bad idea because you will hear endlessly from people that are naysayers or don't understand it and haven't researched as well as you have at that point. Who will say, no, that's not possible. And here's why, and I'm part of being an entrepreneur is that as long as you've done that initial diligence and you've convinced a few smart people and you all agree that this is an opportunity, then you've got to just believe that to the very end and, and, uh, because you will get a lot of days where you start to second guess yourself and where, uh, people are telling you that is not a good idea. Now I'll qualify that with, um, the key to startup success and why they succeed, where big companies don't, is that they can turn on a dime and the whole process of a, I can take you through how we started lying to slash talk to me.

Speaker 1:          01:56          But the whole process is, um, it's really about test and measure, test and measure in a sense. I mean, yes, we all hear about um, you know, there's the facebooks of the world and there's the googles and they're these massive home runs and, and everyone sort of thinks that, you know, I just put up a website and if I get lucky and do the right things, it's going to take off, but very few businesses are created that way and that's, it's, it's, it's sort of like in the movie business, there's only you can count the major stars on, on, on two hands and everybody else's working their ass off. And not that they don't work either, but it's a little easier for him maybe. Um, and so the trick is you don't have to risk a lot of capital upfront to learn things. So the way we do it is, and you don't have to get it right, but you get it out.

Speaker 1:          02:49          There is the trick. Get something out there. If you sit and stew and try to make it perfect and nothing ever gets out there, you can be too cautious. So the trick is get it out there and then iterate, get feedback from customers. And that's what we've been doing. We got the first version of our product out in February of 2008. And um, we, we did, didn't do much to promote it. We just, we got 50, 70 Beta customers and then we iterated on what they were telling us, what they like about it, what didn't they like about it, what features are missing, what do they want to see? And we iterated for nine months until we were comfortable to actually start to put marketing money behind it. And um, and there's a lot of learning that, that, that, that is you have to be receptive to. So, um, it's, it isn't really sort of this, you know, put it out there, build the field, and they will come, which is really has a whole other aspect too is once you've got the product right, the real challenge is attracting customers to it. It can be a fantastic, insanely great product, but if you can't get the word out and acquire customers cost effectively so that you have a business model and can make money. It doesn't matter how nice a product it is.

Speaker 1:          04:07          I have always wanted to start a business. I've always felt that a running my own company was really the best place for me, the best home for me for a lot of reasons which we can go into. Um, and um, typically I'd look at different opportunities and see what, uh, you know, could pan out and the trick is to be very hard on yourself when you're first thinking of an idea and talk to smart people to make sure that, um, you kind of vet it out. Um, and then the first one was, um, typically you want to solve a problem. Right? And the problem I had was that I liked wine, but I would go into a wine store and I had no idea which one was good in which was in, which is still a problem today. So you could rewind spectator, other, other, uh, magazines to learn about wine.

Speaker 1:          04:57          Um, but then you could never find the wines that they were talking about. And so there was a mismatch between the ability to learn about a wine and then act on that information to make a purchase. And Wine Shopper was my first company, which was a site that combined the ability to buy wine with the, uh, information, um, including ratings from wine spectator and wine enthusiast and other agencies, reviews community and all of this. And this was 1999. It was a bubble company. I, it was funded by Kleiner Perkins and Amazon Dot com raise $46,000,000 and built a 200 employee company very quickly. And uh, ultimately, um, learned some painful lessons in terms of access to capital and how quickly that can dry up. Um, the company was ultimately acquired by a competitor, um, and uh, but that competitor did not survive. So that my first sort of big venture kind of deal, good experience, lots of learning, but nobody made any money on x one called Masonic was, uh, uh, I started, you know, I was pretty upset for a little while and then I realized that, you know, um, you've just got to pick yourself up and dust yourself off.

Speaker 1:          06:17          And that's entrepreneurship is really like sales and that, you know, it can, you get a lot of discouragement along the way and you have to be really strong and just keep going. So I just got right back up on the horse, started a company called [inaudible], which is now profitable and growing nicely, still private. I'm on the board, so that one's a wait and see, I'd say, um, uh, then I started a company called Taleo, which was a, um, a white label version of skype if you know what skype is, I think most people do by now. And um, that was very lucky timing and was acquired by Microsoft, um, within 18 months of its being founded. And um, I didn't want to work for Microsoft, so I signed a noncompete, uh, took a year off and traveled and then started my latest venture line to also known as talked to me. Um, but I'm line to is really a, a, um, solution for where business is headed today in terms of the way people work.

Speaker 1:          07:26          If you think about, um, landlines, you know, more and more people are saying, why do I need a landline? And they're getting rid of them and they're sticking to their mobile phone and there's some problems with that because it doesn't always work in your home and there's battery life issues and stuff, but a lot of people getting rid of landlines, we believe, um, with line two, the same thing is happening in the office environment, particularly small businesses. You don't really need an office where everyone has to drive their car in and park in order to be productive anymore. You have all of this technology that you can use the Internet and communication technologies to be productive virtually. So lying to basically a is a business line on your mobile phone. It's a second line so you add a second line to your mobile phone. That's why it's called line to that has all the features ultimately that that office phone had no transferring calls, setting up conferences and stuff like that.

Speaker 1:          08:20          And so we've just released it. It was approved by Apple, um, in early September. And sales have been very strong. I think there's a lot of need for that and ultimately the problem we're solving is that people want to work and be productive, but they don't want or need an office and they don't want to be tethered. There's no, I mean, people don't, even, everyone's using Wifi. There is, there's not even a jack in, into which a plug and office phone in most office environments for new companies. So that's what we do. So long answer to your question, to sort of give you a, of each business, it's always about trying to solve a problem.

Speaker 1:          09:01          Very important. Um, we, I was skeptical at first and uh, I still scratch my head about twitter, but I now uh, uh, uh, I mean, I, it's, it's here to stay, you know, it's one of those things that it's a self fulfilling. It became popular because it became popular. I don't know how to describe it, but, um, uh, at any rate, we, I, the guy that does my marketing is religious about that. So for example, uh, there's a lot of cool tricks. So we, one thing, there's a lot of stuff that, um, that's important. And one of them is you need to blog. And I was like, why do I need a blog? Part of it is, is if you have constantly changing content on your website, so the blog has to be on your website. Then a search engines reward that. So like a new site or sun, constantly changing content.

Speaker 1:          09:56          So if you put up a website and do nothing with it, you'll slip down. If you keep changing the content and making that content relevant to the service that you offer and the types of customers you're trying to attract, you'll start to go up and natural search. The other thing that you do is, and once you blog a post, this is where the social media comes in, post a blog entry, then you tweet it and you post it to Linkedin, facebook, everywhere, um, and two different groups. And, and, and then what happens is this magic thing happens where it just gets, it reverberates through the web. It's really fascinating. And so one blog post suddenly translates into multiple hits and those hits are all then linking back to your blog post. And that means you're getting more links into your website, which as you probably know in search engine optimization, that's another thing that's very important is to generate links back to your site. So, um, I was sort of dragged kicking and screaming. But now I'm a true believer. It really does work.

Speaker 1:          10:58          There's a lot of companies offering phone service obviously. Um, and uh, you know, we are, our differentiation is our focus and I think this is important important lesson for all startups is that, um, we, we have a lot of people because we only charged 1490 $5 a month who ask us if they can hook up a Ata, which is what vonage provides it, which is a little box that you plug your phone into. One end is the internet. The other end is the phone. They want an Ata. But I know from looking at vonage and other companies that the biggest support expense for those companies is that Ata, because getting people to get under their desks and play with their routers and hook that thing up, it's a pain and everyone practically needs a customer support person holding their hand through the process. So it's very expensive.

Speaker 1:          11:48          And um, so we're like, yes, our customers, there are customers that are trying to drag us in that direction, but we are razor focused on our belief that the future is not about wired phones, that the future is about mobile and laptop calling. So it's like skype and your mobile phone. So what does business phone service look like in a world of skype and mobile phones and that's what we're laser focused on and we're the only ones positioned that way. And by being that focused, um, it just makes everything better. One, you can communicate your position to the market in a much more laser focused way so that you can actually stand out as a brand.

Speaker 1:          12:31          That's an interesting question because, um, we are increasingly getting consumers who come to us and um, so the line to app as I talked about earlier, particularly young people that are like a landline, why, you know, why does it make sense for me to buy a phone wire to a wall in particularly young people because they're moving from dorms and apartments and many apartments. It just makes no sense and you can't even, uh, use it most of the time because you're, you're out and about and what have you. So what's the point? So, um, people want to get rid of their landline. The problem is some can't because either they don't have cell phone reception at home, um, or you know, they talk a lot and they don't want to wear down the battery though, you know, there's all sorts of reasons. And so, um, you can use line to the current version works over cellular, but the version coming out in a couple months, we'll work over cellular or over Wifi and that's going to be the first dual mode thing on your iphone, on the smartphone, on the market.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So in the US, so like skype can only work over Wifi, it can go over broadband. So bottom line is a, excuse me, you can't go over cellular. Skype only works over a wide, so on the iphone. So if you can, this now gives you way to ditch your landline. So long answer to your question, but you could use a line to number as your landline substitute. You can use it over Wifi when you're at home and you don't have cell phone reception, you can use it as sort of the number you give out to everybody else, not the number. You're best friends have your cell phone number, but you know your bank people and credit card companies statement. You know anyone billing anyone where they asked for your home phone number that you're doing business with or or something and you don't want to be bothered on your cell phone.

Speaker 1:          14:24          You do that on your line to number and then you have all these controls where you can say, let certain people through, depending on the time of day, who they are, whether they're friend, whether business, different greetings, depending on who they are. Um, you can do all this stuff to sort of make it a much more of a tool rather than a nuisance. Which I think Mike, my landline phone at home, I never answered anymore because it's all spam. It's, it's even though I'm on the do not call lists and have been since I started it. People, I don't know where they get my number, but every call I get is some kind of marketing call. So it's, it's useless.

Speaker 1:          15:01          I mean constant. That's how you learn. Right? And what's nice about silicon valley is that it rewards that. Well, no, let me take that back. Um, it doesn't reward that it tolerate it more than I'm a large enterprise where mistakes can be career ending in an, a really bad company where they, you know, where it's a fear, typically a, a corporation that's run on fear versus encouragement and sticks rather than carrots tends to be an environment where mistakes are not tolerated and then no innovation happens. And so silicon valley's the opposite. It, it encourage you to take risks and, you know, entrepreneurs are not rational business people. I mean, if you look at the risk and reward curves, we're way out here. We're taking a lot of risk for, in the hopes of a lot of reward, but it's not really rational. You actually, most business people are much closer to the, uh, the origin there where there's some risk and some reward but not the kind of risks that entrepreneurs take.

Speaker 1:          16:10          So, um, you know, the mistakes I've made in taking those risks have been numerous. And, uh, you know, there are wine shop or obviously we were burning $3,000,000 a month and before we even had customers. And that was, you know, the dog food that everybody's eating back in or the Koolaid that everybody was drinking was, you know, build these, build it. It's a land grab and the eye. Everyone believed that it was, the Internet was a land grabbing. You had to build this thing. We built a 20,000 orders at a pick pack center to automatically fulfill wine. And it was a thing of beauty. I'm built it from Greenfield to pull production in six months. Had 15 bays for big ups trucks to back up into and you know, it never got to ship much wine. And um, you know, it did actually, uh, those assets were restarted by Kleiner and a new company called new vine logistics which did ship line in the back end for winery clubs and what have you.

Speaker 1:          17:09          But it was never, never the, the opportunity that we all believed it would be. Um, and you know, other mistakes. I mean, you make hiring mistakes, you make, um, a strategic mistakes. You had an opportunity to merge with a company earlier in wine, a wine shoppers history that I did pursue. Hindsight is 20 slash 20, I should have pursued it. Um, but you know, each time you get smarter and um, the other thing you learn to do is you don't fret over your mistakes, you just interest instantly correct and move on. You make a bad hire, you gotta make the decision to say, listen, this isn't right. It's not working out and you cut and run and you and hire someone else. So, you know, as long as you can act decisively, you can, um, uh, undo the effects of bad decisions. But I think we all make that decisions. Um, the fact is, if you never made any bad decisions, you probably weren't taking any risks.

Speaker 1:          18:10          Yeah, fundraising is hard right now. I'm a angels have their personal net worth have been depleted in some cases not depleted, but certainly reduced where they're less willing to take risks. Um, the vcs, some vcs have had trouble closing new funds. I mean, the top vcs have money to spend and there's plenty of money that's being spent and invested. Um, the way I think of it is, um, well in terms of the stages, it will almost always is going to be credit card debt and friends and family initially. Um, it's very rare that you're going to go right out of whatever your ideas pop into Kleiner Perkins and they're going to write you a check. You're going to have to prove something before you can typically raise money from a vc and the four areas that you, they look at, there's four areas of risk and, and investing is all about risk versus reward.

Speaker 1:          19:09          So they want as least as little risk for the most reward. So they're going to try and reduce that risk. So there's management, risk, market risk, financial risk, and technology risk. So Management Risk, if you've never run a company before, you'll do much better going into pitch a VC. If you've already got two or three seasoned people who have run the types of functions, you need them to run and done it successfully on your team. So that reduces management risk. People in the company who've done it before, um, you don't have to do all four of these, but you have to hit to, you know, typically hit depending on the investing climate to two to four. So market risk is, is there a market for your product? What's the competitive landscape? Is it, you know, a billion dollar opportunity because vcs typically they want to see at least a billion dollar addressable market.

Speaker 1:          19:59          That doesn't mean you can't start a company. Um, uh, if it doesn't have an addressable market of a billion dollars, it just means it's probably not a vc play. It's probably a different type of business and you don't have to attract venture to build a great business. As many people know. I'm the third one was financial risk, which is, is there a business model? Can you actually make money, you know, is there a way for this business to sustain itself and be profitable? And the fourth is technology risk, which if your, um, company involves some kind of new technology or new thing, have you built one and proven that it can be done. And, you know, during the bubble days, like in, in 1998, 99 when it was really crazy, you could probably only have to tick off one of those boxes to get vc funding. I'm now, uh, you probably need to tick off pretty probably all four, maybe three. And you know, and market and mitigating market risk means having paying customers, right? So that's not always the case. Certainly in the past few years there's been a rush of money sent into social media stuff. But, um, uh, you know, the more that you can sort of address those four issues and do it in a very convincing way through data, through, you know, um, Beta customers through a letters of intent, whatever you can do to sort of increase the likelihood that you're going to be able to execute is going to improve your chances of getting funded.

Speaker 1:          21:39          It's very hard. Hiring is the most important job of the CEO. And it's the hardest in many ways because if you think about it, first of all, the screening process is broken, right? And you get an email on a resume and you're supposed to figure out who this person is. So clearly the screening process means you're leaving some good people behind and, and not so, you know, obviously that's the whole purpose of using your network. If you can find someone who you are somehow connected with that sort of is the prescreening process either through someone. So that helps with the screening. Um, you know, I, different people look for different things. I've, I've, you know, part of the reason I'm an entrepreneurs that um, I am not a political animal. I don't think I could ever succeed quite frankly in a big enterprise where, in my opinion, and this may be unfair to people in big enterprises where half the battle of getting ahead is playing the political game correctly.

Speaker 1:          22:37          It's not purely about the best ideas. And I'm in a startup environment, you get a chance to see your ideas tried very quickly and it's not about who you play golf with. And so when I'm hiring, I try to look for people who have succeeded environments where politics probably wasn't part of their success. And there's ways to read that. You can read it and body language and answers to certain questions. Um, but I really try to wean out the political animals and focus on people who are really good, not just really politically savvy. And the other thing I do is I, um, you know, I think it's very important to ask them some questions that, uh, are more on the human side, not just the work, the work stuff is a given. Do they have the skills, you're going to get that out of the way pretty quickly.

Speaker 1:          23:36          But then you've got a sort of, is this someone I want to work with is as someone I can trust, is this someone who's a team player? And one of the things I did with my first company actually would, would wine shop or was I the condition of being hired was that everyone was gonna make the same base salary and it was going to be low. And you know, this is when, you know, with Kleiner Perkins and Amazon backing us, there are a lot of people who were coming to us with dollar signs in their eyes. And I said, I want to weed out the people that are really passionate about this opportunity, so I'm going to only offer for these art. And these were people from becoming seasoned people. I'm going to only offer $130,000 in salary. I'll take that salary and everyone will get the same salary and for the first year everyone's going to get the same salary and that after that there'll be more merit based.

Speaker 1:          24:24          And, and that was really effective at building a cohesive team because one, people who were in it just for the money, that was a turnoff for them and they were out the door, they never even applied. And then everyone felt like there's this whole sort of survey or salary envy thing that can happen in a management team. Like how come that person getting paid more than if everyone knows that everybody's paid the same. Then it sort of breaks down that one potential for, um, a tension in the office. And it worked right? Rebuilt at a wine shop or it was probably the best management team I've ever built. I mean, it really was an excellent team and um, so it, it, it's a tough process though and um, you do have to move quickly when you make mistake.

Speaker 1:          25:14          Yeah. I think, um, where it has mostly been in the opportunity with to bond with people in the industry. Certainly in the bay area where I started most of my businesses, it's really a nonissue and in fact it can even be a plus because there's so much networking within the gay world there. But I'm like, there was an instance where, um, a couple, you know, a guy who was very senior at facebook and is moved on to an even bigger role elsewhere as a guy. Really good guy to know. Very smart guy. I've known him for 10 years and um, you know, he and another guy I know and, and I went on kind of the stag trip to Las Vegas and, and, um, I didn't, I wasn't invited and didn't know about it and found out afterwards and it was fine, but, you know, I think they wouldn't have felt comfortable with me being there because it was kind of a stag male bonding thing and um, and I probably wouldn't have been comfortable in it.

Speaker 1:          26:20          The other thing that happens is increasingly I've chosen not to have kids. I realize you can have kids as a, as a gay adult, but I've chosen not to and I'm increasingly people's lives centered around their families and social calendars. So there's, I think there's just stuff that maybe I'm not as connected with people because I don't up play dates with their kids and my kids and all that kind of stuff. So there's some social aspects maybe that I missed out on, but there's never been any sort of problem with anyone finding out that I was gay and suddenly not wanting to do business with me or not wanting to fund me or, you know, in fact, typically what happens because I was afraid to tell people, but when I finally told people that have wine shop or um, the management team, it was amazing.

Speaker 1:          27:11          It really was amazing and I was in a fraternity in college and, you know, have learned how to sort of fit into a very male dominant dominated environment and was just fine at it. Um, so I tend to just slip into that. But, you know, what I don't do anymore is I don't feign interest in sports because I'm simply not. And I don't feign interest in girls because I'm simply not. Um, and so whereas up until maybe even 10 years ago, I would sort of, you know, jump in on those conversations and it just felt so wrong. Right? So I think that was, that's the only issues is maybe just missing out on some bonding opportunities with people that are straight oriented, like family stuff and stuff. But other than that, I'm not really an issue.

Speaker 1:          28:01          You know, I thought I looked at that question and um, you know, I, my favorite business icon is steve jobs in terms of my role model. Um, and he's not gay, but, um, I couldn't, I couldn't think of anyone in the business world that I knew was gay and that I think is telling right because I'm sure that some of these very successful business people that are out there are gay, but they're not out. And so that's why it's difficult to answer that question. I'm in the business world because, you know, I know I'm confidentially, so I won't say. But I can think of five major household name companies where I know either the CEO or very senior people who are gay and um, but they're very careful about it. And so, uh, you know, I think the business world is kind of the last frontier I think for, um, uh, that kind of diversity to really take hold. Um, and it's, it's a, um, I don't know, it's, it's interesting. It also is very regional. I think if you're in, it's big difference if you're trying to do business in perhaps a more conservative part of the country than it would be if you're doing business in San Francisco in New York. We're really, it is completely anon issue. It's just a relevant.

Speaker 1:          29:30          Yeah, there are issues. I mean, certainly, um, I think in the, in the Arab world for example, I think it'd be very challenging. Um, and uh, China, I don't know as much about views on homosexuality, but I imagine not great. Um, you know, the bottom line is that business, unless you're in the sex business, there is no reason to mix sex and business and I'm just like in the straight world, it would be inappropriate in a meeting to discuss your fetishes or, or something like that. Uh, and, and you know, your wife and all, you just don't talk about it. And so it, it really doesn't need to be relevant and it doesn't need to be discussed. And it would be weird. I actually, um, I've always been of the belief that I should just be myself and um, if someone asks me, are you gay, I'll, I will answer them honestly, but I'm not going to broadcast that necessarily.

Speaker 1:          30:34          Um, because it's, uh, it's, it's a personal characteristic of me. Um, I was made this way and it's nothing that everybody I need to rub in everybody's face. I mean, it's just a, it's an, it's an aspect of me. I have no problems with it. I'm proud of myself, but it isn't something I need to wear on my sleeve.

I've met with a New York Times, you know, and it just never comes up, which is great. Yeah.
