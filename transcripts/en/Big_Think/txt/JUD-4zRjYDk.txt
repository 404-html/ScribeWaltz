Speaker 1:          00:05          Well, science is a very, it's actually very difficult field because you need probably above everything else extraordinary patients.

Speaker 2:          00:17          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:17          And what keeps you going is discovery. And sometimes, uh, in a lifetime you may have one outstanding discovery. Um, Einstein used to say that, that he was unusual in that he had had too, but any one would have been enough to have kept him going. Um, most scientists are not in that league, but we all have at some scale, uh, things that were know, really very proud of. If we do, if we discover them, um, often we are looking for them.

Speaker 2:          00:53          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Uh, the idea that a lot of discovery is serendipitous and accidental is tremendously, tremendously overplayed. Uh, I think it's much more likely that once see something almost in everyday life that puzzles you and you carry it around with you for some period of time and then you see some way of connecting to it.

Speaker 2:          01:18          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Uh, you could say our discoveries and autism is an example of that. At a very early age. I was impressed by this child and later saw an opportunity and I struck when the opportunity was there to satisfy my curiosity. So most discoveries of that tough. Sometimes you see things that you can't explain and action say sometimes a lot of time you see things that you can't explain. Um, and sometimes you come up with explanations that are really exciting and 99% of the time those are wrong. And it's really some trivial explanation to the thing that's gotten you excited. Early in my career I used to hate those things and I used to say, you know, you know, only a manic depressive would love living like this. You know, you have, you have, you see something, it's weird. You have, you come up with some great encompassing idea that'll explain it. It's going to change how people think and then the next day you realize that you were really a dumb ass. Nowadays when those things happen, I actually really enjoy them because there are so few, you know, real Eureka moments in one's life that you have to almost enjoy the fake ones. I mean, after all, it's it. The feeling is just as good.

Speaker 2:          02:36          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:36          So I've actually gotten to enjoy those, those weird results that we can't explain. Um, come up with fanciful ideas and then try to batter them, and then you get a double satisfaction because you end up destroying the idea. And it's satisfying I

Speaker 2:          02:48          to destroy the idea almost as much fun to destroy an idea's too as to create one.
