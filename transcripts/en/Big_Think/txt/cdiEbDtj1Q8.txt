Speaker 1:          00:07          I think it's important to have something that's beneath the surface. Otherwise you're writing essentially

Speaker 2:          00:13          an elaborate diary entry. Um, I think profundity is in the eye of the beholder. Um, some of my, some of the essays I get that were eliminated from the collection, there were a couple of them that I decided not to include because they didn't have enough and, or any universal application, you know, what was me, I got a parking ticket or you know, some boy was mean to me and no one, particularly carers, but uh, you can make people care about small, significant details and sort of lend the entire universe to a tiny detail. You know, there's this sort of like themed and Buddhist Meditation Practice where you're supposed to picture the entire world on the head of a pin, you know, and I feel like the only kind of meditation or stillness or non neuroses it's ever made any sense to me. Um, and that's sort of what the essays try to do. Um, you know, some of the critiques have been at, some of them don't do that, that some of them read a little bit too casual. I think when you're writing personal essays, it's, it can be difficult to suss out, uh, what seems profound to you because they, it's not necessarily intellectually profound, sort of emotionally profound. So if you're just sort of coming through it, you know, it's what speaks to or, or what,

Speaker 1:          01:30          what does, it's funny, I've spent I guess about seven years

Speaker 2:          01:38          in total encouraging my author is not to pay too much attention to the critics. That all press is good press. You know, book publicity is very different than any other kind of publicity. And the fact that I have friends who work in music and film publicity and it's much more defensive whereas ours is much more, you know, please God Mr. Short story writer, go commit a felony so I can get you some press. It's very difficult. And, uh, so just to be written about, uh, and then is, it is a feat in itself. And then I guess you kind of worry about the tone second. Um, and I think I have luckily taken a little bit of that to heart. Um, the criticism hasn't been too harsh or I don't see it because they're personal essays. I think if I let it all in thoroughly, it would be a critique of me as a human being.

Speaker 2:          02:26          So it's very easy to look at it and think, you know, a lot of the book reviews have been assigned to people who are slightly younger or my age. And you know, I, I have been sort of more interested to see the reviews by reviewers who I know have been doing it for a while and are really reviewing it as a book as opposed to a extended diary entry that they could have written if only they had had a couple of more red balls after work, you know, so it's, it's pretty easy to slough off, but I think it's important to some of it. And um, and some of it's been really helpful. I didn't expect that. I expected just to be worried about getting press and, and hopefully getting the book out there and getting people aware of it. And, and some of the critiques have been actually really useful.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Also. That was a pleasant surprise.
