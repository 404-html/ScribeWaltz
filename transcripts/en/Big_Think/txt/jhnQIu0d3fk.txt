Speaker 1:          00:07          I think so. I mean you,

Speaker 2:          00:11          I think it becomes really hard if you, if you have like, um, you know, stringent rules about what you will and won't do before you even hear the idea. Um, you know, like a lot of stuff comes to us and we'll start writing it and usually what we do is we just, um, anything that cracks us up, you know, like if we're talking about something, we all start laughing at it. That's a really good thing. And so we try to like, oh, why are we all laughing? This seems like something that could be good. Um, but, uh, you know, sometimes you start laughing and stuff and then you start writing it up and then you're like, Ooh, do I really want to do that? You know, like, do I really want to go and shoot that? Because that's going to be embarrassing. I mean, we just sketched this year where I'm a gay porn star and I get into a car accident with Aziz and I die.

Speaker 2:          00:56          You know, he caused the accident so my ghost haunts him. So everywhere he goes, there's this gay porn star, you know, like harassing him and doing really sexual, horrible things to him. And, um, you know, we wrote that and we were like, this is hilarious. It's gonna be really funny. And then it comes time to shoot that, and then you're like, oh, great, now I've got to do this. So I had to like shave my entire body and an oil at my body, and then just being all these really awkward sexual positions with disease for long periods of time. And so, you know, sometimes you write stuff and then later on you look at it, you're like, ah, we shouldn't have, shouldn't have written that. That's going to, it's going to be different.

Speaker 1:          01:40          Okay.
