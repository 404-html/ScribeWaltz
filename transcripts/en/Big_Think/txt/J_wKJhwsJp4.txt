Speaker 1:          00:08          No one knows all the answers, but I'll. I'll mention two of them. Let me say two words. Television News, television news. Fifty years ago when television news was young, the philosophy television news is basically just broadcast news on television. It was reporters on television, somebody trying to say what had happened. That was what they did. You might have 30 minutes of news without a single televised clip of anything. Just somebody that's sitting there reading the news sometimes at great length, that was television news. It was simply an effort to inform nowadays never to entertain and to play to the gallery. It matters if there are pictures of matters. If their jokes you can tell matters, we'd get. People want to yell and scream at each other.

Speaker 1:          00:50          That's really taken us down a sad path everyone says, but I think it's true. That's emphasized the notion that the right way to have interaction is to get very strong advocates who will call each other names. One thing that's striking about the way the news is today, take an issue, a contested issue, abortion, the war, whatever you like news today is virgo to telling us people's positions on these issues. Candidates say it's very bad at telling us why they have their positions. Uh, it strikes me that one of the jobs of were news reporters, not to say so and so is for or against abortion rights, but what so and so's argument, why does so and so I believe that I, years ago I ran into a guy who was retired reporter for a major newspaper and he was lamenting what had happened to the news and he was telling me how when he was coming along in the sixties, if the president announced the New Urban Affairs Initiative, the headline would be the next day President Announces Urban Affairs Initiative.

Speaker 1:          01:44          And the story would be explaining what it was. This is what the president proposed. That's the story today. He said, and we had this meeting in the nineties today. He said the story would be Republicans Attack Presidents Urban Affairs Initiative as the first paragraph is a brief token. Summer was having the secretary or somebody attacking it third grade because somebody at defending it, you never take much time to explain what it is. The important thing is who's gonna win? Who's gonna lose, who's on which side. That's one thing. Certainly that's to help take us down, but that's not the only thing. One theory is the big problem. Luxury. We've been a generation here. I speak of myself and the other baby boomers whose had everything we don't feel as though we've ever. They were constantly complaining. Everything's going wrong in our lives, but there's a sense which compared to the rest of world we've had everything we've everything we could want. Um, and that's given us a lot of time to ruminate, a maybe too much time to read what I think our luxury has made us in cautious in how we use democracy.
