Speaker 1:          00:02          And there's a lot of people who are for them and a lot of people are against them. It seems that most of the people who are, four of them are essentially ip holding companies who just sit around and wait with patents and wait until technology actually gets interesting using something that could potentially be covered by these patents. And then they sue people and they don't generally, they don't sue smaller companies. They sue, Microsoft and IBM and of course IBM and, you know, like all these big companies have their own patents pools and they use them as leverage against other companies with patents. Uh, but I just, you know, I think there are so many problems with it. Uh, the biggest problems are that you have people patenting and things that are essentially math, which is what patents are not supposed to be even about at all.

Speaker 1:          00:52          Um, and the, I mean, there are other problems. There are no, it's, I'm usually drunk when I give this explanation and it comes out so much smoother. Um, I, I just think that there are a big problem, uh, largely because, uh, you can infringe on them without knowing that you do and as a smaller company you have like, very, you don't have resources to go and research whether or not you do it. It's, I could write a 100,000 lines of code and for all I know 50,000 women fringe on various things. Um, and I wouldn't know that. And normally if you infringe someone's trademark, for example, um, if they don't enforce it, uh, it's to your advantage because a phase they start to lose their rights. Whereas patents, if they don't enforce it for 10 years, they can come and sue you for the 10 years that you've been making money on their patent and you're completely screwed.

Speaker 1:          01:49          So there's no incentive for them to actually go and, and, uh, try to legitimately licensed it. It's really the kind of thing where there are probably, there's probably some middle ground where, uh, it makes sense to have things be patentable. Um, obviously in many places it does make sense, but things like software and people patenting DNA, it's, it's, uh, it's at the point where you have things that are so abstract that they really should belong to everybody and no one's really like making viable businesses on software patents. The only thing they're doing is extorting money out of other people. Um, and the people who have the most software patents probably don't even want them to exist. They're just forced to do it to cover their own asses.
