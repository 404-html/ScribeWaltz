Speaker 1:          00:08          I've got lots of things that, that alarm me [inaudible] worry me and concerned me. And I am, I'm a rabid optimist. Um, uh, uh, I, I just keep seeing so many people doing cool things. I mean, I met a guy, have no idea whether this, whether this technology is going to prove out. Um, but I met a guy last summer who's working on a kind of concrete, uh, cement portland cement is the basic cement. Portland cement is a real greenhouse gas emitter. I mean construction. So, you know, I, I don't know, these numbers are going to be wrong, but construction is 25% of greenhouse gases and submit is 40% of construction, something like that. So it's a big deal. And he is invented this cement that he says, I think he's calling in California summit that has one 10th, again, order of magnitude number, um, the, the greenhouse gas emissions of this.

Speaker 1:          01:14          You're like, wow. You know, I mean, that's cool. And then you hear Urbano speak, and I've heard Bano speak to 10,000 people at my daughter's college graduation. And I've heard Bano speak to a group of 50, 30 something managers in a small room and you think this is the most charismatic man I've ever met. And you think this is quite, he's a rock star, you know, I mean, you know, and, and you, he knows you so smart and full of energy and, and, and then you meet, um, people involved in, in, in healthcare who are not getting involved in sort of sterile debates about, well, they're not out, they're not sterile, but, but, but highly politicized debates about the healthcare policy in the United States. But her saying, if we go and apply the principles of the Toyota production system to the management of hospitals, we can reduce by 90% the number of infections from introducing a central line and we can improve by 50% the outcomes for people who have, who come into emergency rooms with heart attacks. Do you think if we just do this, we, and, and, and, and, and they do what, uh, we, when you see this kind of, uh, of, of activity, you can't help but think this is really cool. I mean, you can't help but be optimistic. It's, it's really exciting.

Speaker 2:          02:42          No.
