Speaker 1:          00:05          Peter, Jay Peterson. Originally, I was brought up in the middle of Nebraska in a small rural town, 1,733 miles to Boston and 1733 to sam go. Um, very profoundly. My parents were Greek immigrants. They came here without a pen, a without a word of English and a third grade education. And they moved out to men, Nebraska because that's where their relatives, where my father took a job. No one else would take washing dishes and the caboose of a Union Pacific railroad that was being built. It was steaming hot there, which I guess the reason no one wanted to take the job and he ate on the caboose and slept on the caboose and saved a virtually everything he made, which he turned into the inevitable Greek restaurant 24 hours a day, seven days a week for 25 years. That never closed. And he was there all too many of those hours, weeks and uh, and years.

Speaker 1:          01:19          I didn't say I'm a great as much as I'd like because he'd leave by six in the morning and he'd come home about nine o'clock at night, pretty much exhausted. So my brother and myself could spend a few minutes with him then usually, uh, providing some hot water and salt for his legs that were swollen with varicose veins. But he was a great model of, uh, working, achieving, and saving for the future. He believed deeply in America. He believed deeply in the American dream and we seem to have forgotten as the American dream is all about your, your children doing better than you do. And one of the reasons he saved was that, uh, he wanted, as he put it to bias, the best education money could buy. And indeed he did. So I learned a great deal from him about focusing on the future, focusing on your goals, uh, saving and investing.

Speaker 1:          02:33          My mother was also a Greek immigrant. She spent most of her time cooking and making all the clothes we wore, which at times got pretty embarrassing. She did everything. She washed iron scrubbed, mowed the lawn. Uh, if there's anything she didn't do around the house, I don't know that during World War Two, when they build an air force base near the small town, the business exploded in size and she worked many, many hours there too. But for much of her life, she was the typical American homemaker I'd say. And we saw infinitely more her than we did. You know, him.

Speaker 1:          03:23          The first born son, psychologically, as we all know, has certain advantages and certain problems. Um, in my case, I was treated like a prince and I, uh, had the great advantage during the first three years or so of, uh, probably they're developing a pretty healthy sense of self esteem and affection. We ran into a tragedy. However, when I was four, my one year old sister died suddenly from croup form of pneumonia, I guess. And she was my mother's attempt to be born again, you might say through her daughter because he's great wives, live very tough lives giving how their husbands were working and when she lost her beloved daughter, she went into very deep mourning. And I, uh, as a child who normally thinks we, I think we think of ourselves as the center of the solar system. Everything revolves around us. We're responsible for everything.

Speaker 1:          04:46          I guess I wondered why as my mother withdrew and to the deepest, deepest depression psychologically what I did to cause her to abandon me, added to my complexities, I guess you'd say. I formed a, uh, a pattern of having to achieve and having to be perfect so I could somehow regain her, uh, her affection and her intention and that's had some good points and just had some bad points because trying to achieve perfection can be a productive, that can also be a very destructive process after a while. So she had quite an impact on me while I was pretty dumb about recognizing whatever talents I do have. George Ball, the grade under secretary of state, and one of my partners at Lehman used to refer to me as relentlessly analytical. I'm pretty good at analyzing problems, getting the facts, raising the right questions and uh, and so forth. I'm also a peculiar combination of a total mechanical Klutz in the sense that I'm incapable of operating in the most simple machine or fixing it. But I've always been rather creative on asking questions that is inventing the questions. So I went through some job changes early on, which reflected a certain, almost invincible ignorance of my qualities. I did my graduate work at University of Chicago on Adam Smith taught us about comparative advantage and how you ought to focus on your comparative advantage. So for reasons that aren't clear at all to me, I went into retailing

Speaker 2:          07:04          yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:04          And uh, was assistant manager of a toy department at Christmas, if you can believe that. And

Speaker 1:          07:15          if, if that experience played to my comparative advantage, I can't imagine what they were. So I quickly got out of that business and got into the market research and analysis business was where I belonged. And later on into the advertising business where I could combine whatever analytical ability I had with working with a creative people, by asking them questions and suggesting problems that need to be solved without knowing how to sell them. So I think my talents are somewhere along the line of analyzing things and having a certain sense maybe of where the world is going and being reasonably creative and asking the questions that sometimes lead to creative answers. Well, I'm a huge believer in dumb luck. I think Donald Look beats a smart planning much more often than we would like to admit. Uh, people have, uh, incorrectly praised my quite varied career, including government service and public service. And I like to explain and how I got into going to Washington and President Nixon's White House and later to his cabinet, I was working at 39 self of cell in Chicago.

Speaker 2:          08:46          MMM.

Speaker 1:          08:48          I used to walk to the railroad stations a lot cheaper. And um, I one day I noticed at 19 south of cell there was universe Chicago graduate school. Well, I been planning to go to northwestern where I'd done my undergraduate work, but it was all the way across Chicago and since it was night school, it would have taken me 20, 30 minutes to get over there in 20, 30 minutes to get back. So I said, well, you know, maybe I had to go to the University of Chicago. It's supposed to be a pretty good place. So that's why I went to the universe. Chicago. It has nothing to do with career planning or anything of the sort. It was there that I made some of the best friends I have on the faculty. Uh, Milton Friedman, George Stiegler, George Shultz, and George later you'll recall, became a very senior figure in the Nixon administration. He became secretary of Labor, uh, office of Management and Budget Secretary to Treasury. And then later in the Reagan administration, Secretary of State and George and I had worked very close together, University of Chicago. And I had taught there for about four or five years, part time at night.

Speaker 2:          10:11          Okay.

Speaker 1:          10:12          So one day he called me and said that President Nixon wants to see it tomorrow. So I go to Washington. I ended up in the Oval Office and uh, the president pointed out to me that, uh, he thought economics was going to become terribly important at the vortex and foreign policy and that, uh,

Speaker 2:          10:38          yeah,

Speaker 1:          10:39          he and Henry Kissinger, my good friend had a very complicated relationship. For some reason he felt need to tell me that Henry didn't know a damn thing about economics and uh, what was worse? He didn't know what he didn't know. So he went on to set up a new council counterpart of the National Security Council and I was to head it, well, this isn't a anything I had planned or anything and I've looked back on that. I've been immensely grateful for my public service opportunity, some of the most exciting experiences broadening I'd ever had. It has led to my being involved with some great nonprofit organizations. I just stepped down after 22 years as chairman of the council on Foreign Relations. I'm the founding chairman of the so called Peterson Institute for International Economics, one of the founders of the concord coalition. And I doubt very much I would have done those things if I hadn't gone to Washington.

Speaker 1:          11:48          And I thought I'd go into Washington if I hadn't have, didn't happen to have an office at 39 as long as southwest cell in Chicago didn't happen to have a downtown school at 19 southwest cell. So never, never underestimate the role of luck in life. And I think the trick, I've forgotten who the councilman was and uh, in New York who once said, I seen my opportunities and I took them. Um, I think it's important when you do have something that luck thrust upon you to somehow be made in such a way psychologically. That is Paul Tillich said once, if you're comfortable with ambiguity, that's, that's what you need when you're in a rapidly changing world. So I say dumb luck and taken advantage of your opportunities will often lead to more instinct places then a longterm smart career planning.

Speaker 1:          13:00          Sure. I do a lot of traveling around the world and I, and government, I got to know other governments as well. That's a remarkable country with regard to its absence of barriers. Uh, is resilience. It's responsiveness. Just think of it. Uh, when my father started his restaurant in the 1920s, the restaurant was petitioned by the Ku Klux Klan saying, don't eat with the Greek. There were no blacks there. So I guess they figured the grapes where the next most desirable, um, target. We go from a situation like that to where if anybody's been prejudiced against me because I was a great guy, been unaware of it.

Speaker 2:          13:56          MMM.

Speaker 1:          13:59          I worked in the 1960s with, uh, when I was CEO of a company called Bell and Howell with Martin Luther King. And I went through the tragic division and racism of the, of the 60s where blacks were formerly and most often informally blocked from all kinds of participation in American life, business, social, political. I looked today to Barack Obama and, uh,

Speaker 2:          14:37          okay,

Speaker 1:          14:38          uh, I think it's quite possible today, let a black could be elected president, the United States. And that's taken place in a remarkably short period of time. So this is a country with limitless frontiers and very few barriers. And if you work hard and study hard and you've got good luck, you can do very well in this country.
