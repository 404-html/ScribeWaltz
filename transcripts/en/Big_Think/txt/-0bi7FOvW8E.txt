Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          no, we have progressed in the gay rights movement, but we haven't progressed as a result of government policies are certainly not leadership at the federal level. I think what's remarkable is that the progress we've made, despite the opposition from the federal government or some of the state governments, it would have been unthinkable to me. I'm 44 years old. Two weeks ago when I was growing up, I would've thought impossible for gay people to marry. Now we have it in many states, including in some of the most remarkable states that you could actually be pronounced husband and husband and wife and wife. You can get buried in Dubuque Buca. You can't get married in Chelsea or in San Francisco. Frankly. The fact that we've made progress in places like that and Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, I think that speaks volumes about the power and the dynamism and the gay rights community that we see still the federal government officials mumble when it comes to questions around gay rights, that these are not equal rights of ordinary American citizens.

Speaker 2:          01:05          We saw the Obama administration submit this brief in the, in, uh, to defend the defense of marriage act and indefensible piece of law that was signed by President Clinton, uh, shows you that in fact, democrats can sometimes not be a lot better than Republicans and some of the key civil rights, civil liberties issues. And here you had the Obama administration filed this brief defending the law in some of the most disgusting rhetoric and language. Uh, I understand the fact that justice department has to defend the laws enacted by Congress, but the way they did so in that brief was really offensive to many gay, lesbian people across this country. And the fact that they had such a teenager that they couldn't realize that the way they were going to defend this law was going to be in a way that would really infuriate gay, lesbian people are across the country.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Who thought that we had embarked upon a very different time in our nation's history. And I think it's great that President Obama actually says the words gay and lesbian. Uh, I think it was notable that the Naacp Convention, he talked about gay people still know having to civil rights and I think it's great that he had this ceremony commemorating the 40th anniversary of stonewall at the White House, but frankly talk is cheap and there's only so long that a very eloquent and very thoughtful and very charismatic president will be able to get away on talk alone. Frankly, the policies and the outcomes and the decisions of that government has to measure up to the talk that both led him into the White House. And that is still allowing him to lead the public in very significant ways. At one point, we all turned off for when people's actions don't measure up to their words.

Speaker 2:          02:48          Uh, I don't think anyone legitimately can say that. Don't ask, don't tell us worked. Even the wife of the author of that, uh, the terrible policy, a rat on a campaign, it was a mistake to put, don't ask, don't tell in place that you created a witch hunt in the military that you can be gay. You just can't ask about it. You can't tell anyone about it. But if you tell someone or someone asks about it, then you could still be pushed out of the military. It's, it's, it's ridiculous. They promise to, uh, to undo. Don't ask, don't tell. They are the bomb administration, uh, but they're saying now that they will, they'll get to it and they're sweet. They're sweet old time. Uh, it's really quite different if you're an openly gay or lesbian, serving in the military and putting your life on the line for our country, and yet your government can discriminate against you and you could lose your job even as you, you lay down your life for your country.

Speaker 2:          03:42          You could still be kicked out from that, that posts or that, that position. And frankly there is no. There's no reason why we ought to wait. The, it's not as if we're going to be able to fix the economy or the healthcare or the environment or even these wars in the near future. And that frankly, social change is not a sequential piece. This is not like your college prerequisites. We, you take economics 100, one before you go to economics due to, oh one. Frankly, these issues all have to be dealt with aggressively and the idea that we will wait to deal with them just shows in fact that they're not a huge priority for this administration the way we had hoped and that in the way that many had voted for them to bring about that change. I find it remarkable that increasingly the Obama administration is is sustaining withering attacks, not just from civil libertarians about human rights and civil liberties, but from the gay community, from the women's community, from young people, from the antiwar activist.

Speaker 2:          04:42          We. Those were the. Those were the base that often created the seedbed that got him elected and yet some of the major issues that I think propelled so many young people and so many different people to vote for this president are now other ones that we find on the back burner I think is actually not a very good political agenda. It doesn't take a lot for a 25 year old to become disenchanted. Once again with the political process and you know frankly when when folks turned out in record numbers and gave record amounts of money is because they want to see swift decisive change and that has yet to come about, well certainly giving the full protection of health benefits to federal government employees, which is not what he's done a would be an important first step. You're look at President Obama is like a ceo of a major corporation, right?

Speaker 2:          05:32          It's just like as if you were the CEO of Walt Disney or apple and if you're concerned about the health and wellbeing of your employees, you want to protect them. You want to protect them and their families. I think it is remarkable that this president has said that even though a CEO, the government workers of the United States of America, that he won't provide healthcare benefits for same sex partners who work a for with the federal government. That's something he could do. That's something he ought to do. Frankly. If apple can get around to it or Nike can get around to it and Walt Disney, you can get around to it. I think the CEO of United States of America can get around to that too. It doesn't need congress. It could just implement that. Uh, that was also another misstep on the gay rights front. Uh, you Adama you had the mumbling on don't ask, don't tell.

Speaker 2:          06:22          You had the lack of providing full healthcare benefits for federal government employees. People begin to scratch their heads and wondering whether or not we're going to see the type of change we were hoping for. And that's the type of change that the president can bring about. He could also use the bully pulpit to be very clear around marriage. And in fact, the president has said in his books and his public speaking, that he struggles with the idea around marriage for lesbian and gay people. Not that hard a, frankly, we don't have the same protections as straight people have. No, he is protected by the law of the presence protected by law. He's got two beautiful daughters and a wonderful first lady who's his wife. And the law protects their family, uh, protects them from discrimination, protects them in case anything were to go wrong with either one of the parents, gay people across this country don't have the benefit of those legal protections.

Speaker 2:          07:12          And no matter how much they say they want to treat us as equal citizens and give us a full rights, the fact is, unless you move and you implement on those rights, it's, it's just rhetoric. It's just a hortatory language. Uh, and frankly, it, the time has come for bold, decisive leadership and seen it in states all across this country. Frankly, Massachusetts as married gay people now for over a year and some months. And the institution of marriage, I don't think there's any weaker and mess Massachusetts. And is that. It was three years ago. We've seen it in Connecticut. And frankly, decisive, clear action from the federal government, I think is essential. Unnecessary. And it's still a.
