Speaker 1:          00:09          Pages contains all the innovation, so what you need to do is preserve those who are innovative, get the hammer, no reward for being innovative, and the founding fathers put that in the constitution. It's interesting, everybody talks about the rights of people this, right? That right. I went to a graduation, my wife got a doctorate in public health and the speaker said, you have a right to good health or saying what are they talking about? They've lost their minds. It means I'm never going to have a tooth to gang. I've never even had a stomach ache, you know, I ever write to, you know, not have cancer or something, who going to give me these rights? The only right that is spelled out in the constitution is the copyright. And what it says is those who innovate should get the reward for their innovation, for copyright from patents and a general ip on that. And Lincoln was a big believer in this. In fact, Lincoln took out some patents and uh, he loved the idea of that. So when you think to yourself, what could encourage innovation? A lot of conventional thinkers who would say, oh, just you know, for the government to spend a lot more money on our end date, the founder says, well, that's fine, but the best thing we can do to spur our r and d is not spent any money but to provide it so that the creators get to keep what they have.
