Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          I think they're all a number of different examples in, uh, in different places. I think it's hard to make sort of this and I want to make any sort of sort of a grand statement to say, oh, this executive gets it across the board. I think there are, you know, you can, you can point to what the New York Times is done with, uh, with our apis instead of making that information widely available at the Guardian has done some similar things in the UK. Sticking in the UK. You can, you can look at the Telegraph which has done. They've really begun to sort of figure out what, what are the core functions that we need to do and we need to own in house and what are the ones that we can outsource. Um, whether it's sort of technology, um, or even forms of sort of the content instead of, and, and, and the, and the printing of the papers.

Speaker 2:          00:51          Um, uh, you can look at the Journal and what they've had. Some of the experiments that they've done around around paid content and trying to sort of find out how these, both paid content and free content can coexist on the web, how to sort of have their cake and eat it too, with, with, with, with traffic coming in, but also having a, having a subscriber base. Um, I mean, I think there's a, you know, the fte sticking with the paid content side of things where they sort of did this metered model for content. I think there's, there's been a number of different innovations and I think it ranges across the board. Um, La Times. Another great example of using technology that's not their own to tell stories better online, uh, in this case you, the way that they use google maps. I mean, I, I kind of always point them out as, as, as, as a perfect use case of this where, um, la times coverage of the wildfires, which unfortunately is basically every year you've got these series of wildfires.

Speaker 2:          01:40          Uh, and they just, they, they take Google maps to take our API. They plug it in, they put their images on there, they put the stories, they, they, they annotate the map to show where the damages were, the evacuation areas are the latest developments of it cause it's a very visual story beyond just the, the images of the fire itself, but to see the location of it as well. I'm just a really good example of how they can use technology that's not their own to tell stories in a different way. That's just simply not even possible offline. If you take a look at the paper and you can say, well here's, here's the fire, but it's real time. It's dynamic. So I think there are, there are a number of different people who are doing interesting things and those are just the big players that, that doesn't even touch on all the sort of small startups that are just doing a really, really interesting things. Some which are just weird and strange and ultimately maybe you'd say are bad, um, but are just, are really encouraging attempts to sort of try and figure out how to use the medium differently.

Speaker 2:          02:37          I think. Absolutely. I mean, I think that they have, they are very aware of the traffic that they get that is now beyond their borders. And that gets back into there. There's the downside to the local monopoly, uh, the local newspaper that had a monopoly on information that all of a sudden it sort of broken down. But that's, that's the downside from a business model standpoint. But the upside for the business model is this, that I, I don't, it doesn't cost a, you know, even a fraction of a penny to reach a user who's, you know, tens of thousands of miles away from me if I've got this great content. So you see things like the Guardian, the Telegraph, the BBC, which is, you know, really I would argue is, um, is, is not just a, a, a, a UK source of news is really sort of a global source of news done in some ways.

Speaker 2:          03:19          It always has been. But, um, the way that they can reach people on online is I think is, is very different. And they begin to think about how can I cover stories differently? Who's, who's my audience? I think that the definition of audience is is rapidly changing. The Guardian experimented a little bit with having a, a, a, a bureau in the US and trying to set a target information specifically for those of us users, but it's, it's really trying to get those different perspectives and being able to read them. Just clicking. I mean like you don't have to go down to the sort of know that the, you know, that one new stand that has all the different international magazines and newspapers. I'm sort of maybe sort of frequented by ex pats. All that information is online and I think that's really changed their ideas of what their audiences and how to reach people.
