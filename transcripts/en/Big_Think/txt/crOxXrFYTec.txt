Speaker 1:          00:00          Hi Bill, so you know me as a producer at big thing and my question for you is my favorite question for all of our desks, which is that keeps you up at night.

Speaker 2:          00:13          What keeps me up at night? Climate Change, climate change keeps me up at night. Everywhere I looked, there were opportunities to be addressing climate change and everywhere I look we're not doing it and by we I mean not just humankind writ large, but my United States where I grew up, where I went to engineering school where I worked as an engineer trying to make the world better for somebody and we are missing all these opportunities. It's just crazy making and this is by the way why I'm very proud to be the CEO of the Planetary Society. We are accomplishing something in space. We are getting things done in space and I claim that space exploration is good for everybody. So it's not the Apollo era. We're not devoting 10 percent of the world's largest government funding to this one thing. We're spending about point four percent be nice if it were point five percent, but we're spending a reasonable amount of our intellect and treasure on learning about the cosmos and the Planetary Society works very hard to direct that expenditure in what we think is the best, most efficient way today.

Speaker 2:          01:26          By the way, right now is the press conference about what instruments will be put on the Europa mission. This is a spacecraft going to the moon of Jupiter called Europa. Looking to see if it's habitable are, is there a chance that are living things they're such a discovery would change the world. With that said, climate change keeps me up at night, but the opportunities that we're missing, it's just crazy. Making these people who are in denial of climate change. Look, if you're a denial list and this will probably find its way to you and you will post these crazy, mean spirited comments about me and knock yourself out, it's fine with that. Brings you joy. Okay, but if somebody told you that there is no connection whatsoever between smoking and cancer, would you vote for that person? Would that be somebody you trust now, 50 years after that discovery was made?

Speaker 2:          02:26          Well, the connection between humans and climate change is about that strong and by some very reasonable modern statistical reckoning, slightly stronger. So if you're a denier out there, I strongly encourage you to cut it out. Just change, just get to work. There's nobody more passionate about the environment than the guy who just built his log cabin. There's nobody who wants you to quit smoking more strongly than the guy who just quit. Or the Gal who just quit. There's no more antismoking advocate stronger than the person who just quit smoking. So if you're a denier out there, you could change and we embrace you and we could get to work and the opportunities are renewable energy, transmission of electricity. Electricity is like magical energy, electricity, storage or energy storage. And then if that's from an engineering standpoint, and then the huge opportunity is to create a system where people have to pay for the carbon dioxide they create and then take those funds that, that treasure and redirect it into basic research so that we can, dare I say it, change the world, and then I could sleep at night.
