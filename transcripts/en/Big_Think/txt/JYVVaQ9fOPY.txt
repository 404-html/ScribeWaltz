Speaker 1:          00:07          I once was

Speaker 2:          00:10          doing an article when I was working at Fortune magazine. Um, I did an article about, um, power. I actually did two articles about power and corporations and I got very interested in psychological testing and how, um, and, and because there was a fad, this was, I can't remember, seven or eight years ago, there was a fad for giving psychological tests to people before they got promoted when Myers Briggs tests, but also other kinds of tests. I also was intrigued because back in the 1950s, um, there was a fad for aptitude tests and in fact it was concerned with the aptitude test fads that cut will you make white to start writing the book that became the organization man or the articles for fortunate. It became an organization man. And included in that book is a chapter on how to cheat on aptitude tests, um, how to take them on, how to cheat on it.

Speaker 2:          00:59          So I got interested in the personality tests and I went to a psychologist friend and I said, would you teach me how to cheat on psychology tests? She said, no, I can't. I mean, I'm not allowed, you know, professional standards. It would, I can't, but I'll give you one. I'll give you the battery that I give, uh, cause she does executive coaching and so on and so forth. So she gave me this battery of tests and gave me the feedback and out of it, and of course I tried to teeth, but out of it I got some interesting feedback in which she said that, that she was intrigued by the way my mind worked because she found that, that my mind worked in a way that not too many other people in her experience experience did, is it made all kinds of connections to things in strange ways.

Speaker 2:          01:46          I would, I, you know, I leap from a to Z to m to l a to p and I pull in things from a, from a whole lot of, uh, a whole lot of sources and sort of dance around topics until I get it right. If I get passionate about an idea, I swarm it. You know, I overdo it. A, I kill it. And I, you know, I just go all over it until I think I understand it. Uh, or until, or until I'm bored and I go somewhere else. So it's that kind of, there's not an orderly process. It's a fairly physical process. I mean, there's, I squirm a lot around in my chair when I'm excited by an idea or you start talking to people like I wanna, I want to run it by them. So, so it's, it's a kind of a noisy, um, a noisy process of seeing connections and getting excited.
