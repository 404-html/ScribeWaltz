Speaker 2:          00:11          Well, the effects of and mixed at best,

Speaker 1:          00:15          the centerpiece of the administration's policy was of course no child left behind NCLB, which had I think, a few commendable goals, one of and, and for that reason, it was supported by people across the aisle as well by George Miller, for instance, on that in the house. And by Teddy Kennedy, one of the goals was as George Miller put it, to shine light in the corners to make it very hard for schools that did well on average to hide, uh, the, uh, the data if they were doing poorly with disadvantaged kids. So there was a real emphasis in, in improving and improving equity. And the problem is, in my view, is a very poorly crafted policy is a real sledgehammer. It set a required setting, arbitrary targets, many of which are unreachable by what I would consider legitimate means. And it made test scores the end all and be all of education. It made it impossible or very difficult, difficult
