Speaker 1:          00:01          Every technology I look at is now entering this expedites will go. Ray Kurzweil says, is any technology. It becomes

Speaker 2:          00:07          the information. It starts advancing exponentially. It seems that everything is being digitized now and every technology I look at seems to be entering this exponential curve and what happens is that when technology is advancing at an exponential curves, they're doing amazing things, but when technologies converge, when exponential technologies converge, that's when you get industry disruptions. Behind everything is computing. You know this device over here, but my estimate is more powerful than 40 cray super computers were. Remember cray super computers that we used to cost in the tens of millions of dollars that had export controls on them. This is more powerful than those cray super computers where there's something in computing called Moore's law, but Moore's law stipulates that the processing power of computers doubles every year or two. It's actually the number of transistors, but what in fact happens is that the power increases, the cost drops and this size become smaller.

Speaker 2:          01:03          This exponential curve they're computing is on means that faster computers can design faster computers with faster computers. You can now design new types of sensors with faster computers. You can now build artificial intelligence with faster computers. You can now analyze data like wouldn't even never analyze before. When you have artificial intelligence and sensors and robotics coming together, you get R, two, d, Two from from star wars. You get these humanoid robots that can do what human beings can do. You get the ability now to have robots that can stock your shelves, that can operate machinery, that can be receptionists in your offices, so you have multiple technologies coming together, which, which make it possible to do things I could never be done before. If you look at drones, what are drones? We had flying machines for a long time, but these flying machines we used to build these toys.

Speaker 2:          01:56          We built this toy. Helicopters weren't stable when you added a dreamer shifts to them when you added computing to them and you added deliberative artificial, artificial intelligence to them so they could keep track of all the data around them. You had the ability to have these drones being stable and now ship goods, so drones are advancing almost exponentially and those drones are gonna disrupt the entire logistics industry. Imagine now being able to have your mail being delivered to your mailbox using drone. Imagine having packages being delivered by drone. Imagine having us being delivered by drone. I'm not kidding. Look at a hung and what they're doing in Dubai. That's really a drone on steroids that's being used to transport human beings. So every industry I look at, I see as being ready for major disruption. Manufacturing is going to come back to the United States. In fact, it is coming back to the United States right now because of robots that can do what human beings can do.

Speaker 2:          02:54          You have financial. It's about way disrupted because you have robot advisors, you have digital, you now have data which kind of stock trades and so on. All of these advances happening, which I'm about to just help finance and when you look at transportation, you have electric cars which are becoming cheaper and cheaper because of the advances in battery technologies. You have self driving technologies because of the advances in ai imagined self driving electric cars that cost about 15 or $20,000 in the year, 20, 25. What do you think has been happening to GM, Ford, Toyota, all of these companies will still need one or two electric companies, but more likely than not, there'll be some upstarts from silicon valley or from New Delhi or from Sao Paulo that put the right technologies together and that are inexpensive, that started disrupting the entire transportation industry. As soon we're going to have virtual reality that's going to disrupt education itself.

Speaker 2:          03:44          Imagine being able to put glasses on and watch me watch this in three dimensions and converse with me. Imagine me able to meet with people interactively on the moon, on are on Mars or in Tahiti. That's going to disrupt the entire, uh, conferencing industry because we will be able to have meetings in exotic places and it'll feel like we're almost there, right? Education. Imagine being able to learn science by, um, by doing virtual experiments, anatomy, by seeing your human body inside and out. Imagine learning mathematics by going into ancient Egypt. And building permits, imagine learning Latin by going back in time and, and talking to people in Latin. I mean this is all becoming possible and this is within five years we'll have that. Imagine having digital tutors that, that monitor your expressions. Cameras can already do that. And then monitor the child's interest in learning.

Speaker 2:          04:42          If the child likes to play games, it plays games with them. The child likes to play to watch videos. It takes them into three dimensional holographic worlds and lets them experience, um, and have experiences and learn on their own is the child likes reading books. It reads books to them. So we're talking about disrupting education itself. Now granted that the, uh, the harvards, the Carnegie Mellon's, you know, the elite universities have several brand name was still value them, but the world's masters will be able to now get into holographic words and learn in many new ways. Every single industry where technology can be applied is about to be disrupted in, in a, in a big way.

Speaker 2:          05:27          Let's look at our own health. What's happening now is that we become data and no doctor, they've got mixed software. Let me explain, we were fitbit's, we were all these devices that monitor body's functioning, move forward five years and will have sensors in our clothing. Imagine that fruit of the loom tag in your underwear, which is monitoring you, 24 slash seven, monitoring your activity levels, which is monitoring your ekg is all these different symptoms that can be captured from the skin. Imagine it being gathered 24 slash seven being uploaded to the cloud and having an ai now analyzing the data and say, look, you're about to get sick. You need to get some exercise, and then having all of these cameras and sensors which watch what we're eating, what we're doing, and saying, alright Vivec, you don't need that extra piece of Pie. Stop, abort, abort, abort.

Speaker 2:          06:16          This is all becoming possible in the next five years or so, we should be able to build these technologies. So we have digital doctors. Now, the second part of it, genomics, in the year 2000, there was a race between the US government and a scientist, greg venter, to sequence the human genome. The government and affiliated lab spent two point seven, $5,000,000,000. Venter came up with $100,000,000. Don't ask cow, but he took government data, any sequence, a human genome. It made front page news worldwide. For a long time. Nothing happened. We thought genomics was a waste of money, but over the last two or three years, it's now gone at this exponential curve. The study's been published very frequently. Now, almost every week you're seeing groundbreaking study is about the discoveries, discoveries in genomics, the correlations between our health and our genes, but you know something. What blows my mind the most is the microbiome.

Speaker 2:          07:13          When you went to school, your teacher, your biology teacher taught you that we've made up of cells and the cells have a nucleus and that's where your DNA is. Do you know something? What she taught you was wrong? We made up of bacteria. We have somewhere between two and 10 times more bacteria in our body than we have cells. The same technology which is sequenced. They used to sequence the human body and that's being used to sequence plants has been sequenced. It's been used to sequence the bacteria in our gut and for the last few years they had been measured breakthrough than this. Now I have a google alert on the word microbiome. Everyday I read new studies, new breakthroughs happening with the microbiome. It seems that the DNA is important and relevant, but we may be looking under the wrong. A lamp over here. They also study which is showing that it's what we eat and the, uh, this, these trillions of bacteria that we have in our, in our body that there may be regulating our health unit.

Speaker 2:          08:12          For example, they will study. There was a study published in nature magazine about a year and a half ago in we say took the, uh, the feces, if I can say this on big thing. Feces means shit to feces of a fat mouse and gave it to 'em a 10 miles. And the thin mouths gained weight. They took the feces from a thin Muslin, gave it to a fat mouse and the mouse lost weight. Now, China is also replicated some of these findings in human beings and they determined that there's a correlation between obesity and your microbiome, so forget all these diets we've been obsessed with. Could it simply be a matter of taking the feces of a thin person and giving it to a fat person and a fat person loses weight? Let's watch this space over the next five years. We'll have scientific evidence of this and also curing disease.

Speaker 2:          09:01          They've been studies to show the Crohn's disease, which is a debilitating disease that children get. They took the feces of a healthy child and gave it to an unhealthy child and it appears that the unhealthy child was killed. You're curing disease by transplanting bacteria. It doesn't make sense. And then, um, antibiotics. There have been several studies which show that children who received antibiotics than to be a base, it may well be that antibiotics are killing off entire species of bacteria in our body and they're making us sick. You know, this is the crazy prediction. And, um, but I really believe this is going to happen that within 10 or 15 years we look, come to the conclusion that antibiotics were destroying our health. It may well be that we look at antibiotics the same way we look at those leeches that they use to suck out blood from patients in, in, in, uh, in England.

Speaker 2:          09:58          And you know, the belief was that you could kill health by sucking our blood using leeches. Okay. That may be what antibiotics are doing to us. Still emerging technology. We don't know yet, but when I read these studies every day, that is a conclusion I'm getting to that the entire Western medical system is about to be up ended through the microbiome. So move forward to the 20 20th. We have all of these diagnostic data. We have all of these data about our genome and our microbiome. We have data on not thousands of people but hundreds of millions of people. And we have ai that analyzes all of the information. That app on your smartphone that's monitoring you. Twenty four slash seven may be the best doctor you've ever had. It's your friend. It's your advisor, it guides you on how to maintain optimal health and it guides you on how to get healed. If you do get sick, this is five slash 10 maximum 15 years from now, I think closer to the five to 10 year, a beard that will have all these amazing advances. So this is exponential. It's incredible. It's amazing. And, um, what the future holds in health.

Speaker 2:          11:12          If you look at artificial intelligence, I know when I was young I was reading about how ai would soon be able to defeat the humans at playing chess and everything else. They will, all these predictions made in the 19 sixties about how ai will become smarter than men. And then in the 1980 then in 1990 nineties, we heard about Japan and the fifth generation project, we sort of thought that Japan would rule the world and an ai. And then what happened? Nothing happened. We basically had what was called the new, the Ai winter that, um, uh, there was a cloud cost over Ai. We thought it was a hoax. It was a fraudulent and ai was dead. Isn't dead, is everywhere. Because here's, here's what happened. Scientists also started speculating on a new method of doing ai. The Ai that defeated Garry Kasparov, big blue was really a decision tree.

Speaker 2:          12:07          It did, if then l statements of every possible chess move and with super fast computers, it was able to outsmart a human being that's really simplifying the technology, but that's more or less the ai we had a decade or 15 years ago and scientists have speculated that maybe we could do a different form of Ai. We could mimic the human brain. The human brain has layers of neurons which you know, and the connections between the neurons, the program based on what's learned. So a child sees a dog and mom says, this is the doggy, this is a cat and this and the neurons adjust themselves to do associate that, that image of, you know, an animal with the ears and a tail and so on, the shape with a dog. So outbrain programs itself based on what it learns. So scientists speculated there were papers published study years about this, that we could do ai using neural networks.

Speaker 2:          13:01          Here's what the problem was to do neural networks. We needed massively parallel computers. We didn't have those, even the fastest supercomputers of their time in the 1970, then the 19 eighties and even 19 nineties, couldn't do massively parallel computing about a decade ago and video and decided to develop a chip to let children play video games better. The GPU, the graphics processing unit and, and uh, they released it a few years ago. It became a big success and then scientists are looking at that Gpu and realize that that's a massively parallel computer. Why can't we now do ai with it? Started doing it and machine learning, develop their many words over here, but essentially we started mimicking the human brain and using these, these, these GPS to learn the way human beings do. That's when you started having Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking and a bunch of others talking about artificial general intelligence saying, oh my God, these things are going to be smarter than us and all of these dangers.

Speaker 2:          14:04          The trouble was that that was the stuff of science fiction and this was narrow ai where you specifically taught a computer what to learn. You developed a model and then you throw data at it and it learned from that. So we assumed that you this age, I was 20, 30 years away. Here's what happened in the last couple of weeks with a narrow, narrow ai that a bunch of scientists figured out how to defeat capture by having the computer learn itself, did experiments. It really tried every combination, figured it out. And then Google was able to um, to have alphago which is defeat these goplayers at learned on its own. So it seems like narrow ai is running on its own now. You can throw anything you want at it. If you take that one step further and you say, okay, I can learn anything that you wants to learn and you'll begin to see out of your general artificial general intelligence, the stuff out of science fiction becoming possible.

Speaker 2:          15:01          So this is all happening a lot faster than if anyone. Anyone imagined. I mean, maybe there was some people who saw it coming, but the vast majority of experts in this field didn't think that ai would progress at the rate it's progress just over the last few weeks and it could well be that we get are today to a. You Remember Star Wars Rosie from the jetsons. Samantha from her. All of these things was found science fiction that they starts showing up in our apps and then in these bots we have at home in the next seven to 10 years. So I won't be surprised if I'm able to order a rosy on Amazon.com in the year 20, 25, 20, 27 and she's droned over to my house and Rosie costs about $10,000 because that is how ai and robotics and whole bunch of other technologies are advancing exponentially.

Speaker 2:          15:57          Ever since the Internet came out, we've started ordering things on the Internet with the first one is some of the, some of the earliest websites were these, uh, these websites is retailing websites where you could buy oddities on the, on the Internet. And then we could buy clothing on the Internet and then you can buy shoes on the Internet, and now Amazon has become a dominant player because practically everything you need can be ordered on the Internet and it comes to your house often within an hour or so. So that was retail disruption one-on-one. Now, something even more dramatic is happening that the retail store itself is becoming digitized. When you walk into your supermarket, when you walk into any retail store, you'll note that the camera's over there, you know the last two years or so, the ability for computers to recognize faces, exceeded the ability of human beings to do recognize faces.

Speaker 2:          16:51          So those cameras now had the ability to know who you are. And they have the ability now to just do a interface with the registers where you buy things and to keep track of what are you but your bought. Give it five or 10 years and you'll be walking up to the counters and you'll have. You'll have ads being served to you based on your buying habits and based on your interests. So the entire retail experience begins to change because you have customized coupons, customized ads all being served 50 years. You walk in there, but then also the sensors I talked about the cameras, they can also detect inventory. They can see what's on the shelf, how much of it has been sold. You don't until today we we've had human beings going and doing an inventory checks every two or three days ago and see what needs to be stacked and so on.

Speaker 2:          17:39          But with this cameras they can keep track of what's on the shelves and they can automatically order. New replenishment is as needed and then we'll have robots that can go and replenish the shelves rather than human beings going in and stalking. You know, I'll sell boxes. Imagine you had robots that can do that already. The number of robotic technologies that can. They can go in and do this thing, but give it five or seven years we'll have robots replenishing shelves, will have sensors and ai monitoring inventory move forward a couple of years. Virtual reality is going to become much more powerful. Imagine wearing eyeglasses that dundalk and take you into a holographic worlds. Imagine now being able to meet people where they want to and being able to converse with them as if you were there. Imagine not being able to go into a store and now pick and choose what you want from it. Being able to examine the merchandise and just say, okay, I'll take it and imagine having a drone over to your house.

Speaker 2:          18:39          Let me switch gears now and talk about saving the world because I live in Silicon Valley and frankly I get depressed at the fact that the tens of billions of dollars being thrown at mindless apps, they would happen to. There's some kid comes up with some new stupid APP and he gets $100, million in funding and other vcs give to another hundred million dollars a competitive it is. We basically chasing rainbows in silicon valley and not understanding the problems of the world. I was born in India. I traveled the world and when I go there, I see poverty. I see despair. I see, uh, you know, people living in ill health. I see hunger, I see disease, I see you know, a majority. I see people getting sick because of bad water and it's depressing to see that we are living in silicon valley. We're blessed living in New York City. You're blessed because you have everything you need.

Speaker 2:          19:35          We don't. We know we see poverty and we ignore it, but by and large, we're not sensitive to the needs of the world. You travel to the developing world. You see the dire poverty and the pain and suffering, but you know something I believed in the next 10 or 15 years we can solve virtually all of these problems that are, that are, you know, hurting people so much. You know, the, the biggest volume is energy. When people in remote parts of India, Africa, South America come home, they can't study because they don't have light. This is something we can't comprehend in America that you don't have lights. You can study. Therefore children don't get education, but this is a common problem in the developing world. 80 eight percent of the infections disease in the developing world is caused by water borne viruses. You know, when you went to school, you learned how to distilled water, what do you do, your body did you capture the condensation and that is the distilled water.

Speaker 2:          20:27          Distilled water is 100 percent pure. There's nothing living in it right now. All it takes to have 100 percent clean water to boil the oceans and have all the water we need is energy. The trouble is it energy has been so expensive. Well, guess what? That's changing. We're headed into an era of unlimited clean and almost free energy. Here's what's happening. Solar Wind, take solar as an example. The cost of solar has dropped 99 percent since 1976. And what happens is that as the price drops, the installations installations double as the is double the price drops. We're in a virtuous cycle of here of, of exponential technology advances at the pace we're going. We're only about six doublings away from having the capability of generating 100 percent of the earth's energy needs through solar. This sounds crazy, and the dumplings are happening less than every two years from now.

Speaker 2:          21:24          So what I'm saying is that by 20, 30 or so, we could have unlimited clean energy on this planet from sunlight and the cost will be a fraction of what it is today. Imagine one 16th of what it is today, one 30th of what it is today in less than 15 years from now. This seems crazy. That seems unimaginable, but all you have to do is look at the data and look at the trend. It is as clear as can be now in America, we regressing because you now have the US government. And when I say US government, I mean Donald Trump talking about bringing coal back. He's talking about stopping the progress of solar energy because it disrupts us unemployment. This is complete nonsense. Mean solar is generating more jobs than coal ever had. And uh, this is good for America. It's good for the world.

Speaker 2:          22:13          But regardless, leave America site America is not relevant anymore. The really good news that we hear is that America isn't leading the world anymore. It's China. Number one. They have committed to me, I think 200 gigawatts in the next five or seven years in India. Number two, they talk about 100 gigawatts. We're talking about, you know, the two largest population countries in the world now leading the bath on solar and even America decides to bring coal back instead of coal fire plants. It doesn't matter the world. World War simple, laugh at us. The cost of solar will still still advanced and the beauty of this is that every village in the world will now have light. Now, the, the, the, the challenge over here is that you need to store the energy because it doesn't. The Sun doesn't shine and when it's not sunny, the wind doesn't blow and it's windy, but the, the good thing is that the cost of storage is also dropping exponentially.

Speaker 2:          23:02          We should talk about three, four or $500 a kilowatt hour for storage. Elon musk is hinting at $100 a kilowatt hour the next three or four years and it could go to $70 a kilowatt hour. When you talk about prices such as that, you're talking about self driving electric cars called costing about 15, $20,000. Being able to drive 200 miles by the mid 20, 20 is 20, 25. We could have cars that cost $1,500 and go 100, 200 miles. We're talking about now having enough storage for village for a couple of thousand dollars, which means that you could have entire villages, entire towns all over the world which are off the grid and have unlimited clean energy, so now we can have unlimited clean water because we could just boil the oceans. We can now have lights that children can come home and study and we can educate them because they'll also have smartphones that provided them with knowledge.

Speaker 2:          23:59          We can now have diagnostic devices which provide them with information so that they can get into the smartphone and get health. They can grow, have vertical farms. This is another amazing technology that we don't talk very much about in the United States, but vertical farming is now advancing exponentially because of two or three different convergences. First of all, led lighting. We don't have to understand that led lighting now has become cost about the same as, as these old bugs we had the edison bulbs in the developing world. They even cheaper and led lighting the, there was a Nobel prize two years ago for led lighting. They've been such amazing breakthroughs in led lighting so that you can now fueling the, um, the frequencies to the growth of plants so you can now have inexpensive energy led lights and now you can also have sensors and sensors, cameras and other devices which monitor crop growth, which monitor the growth of every plant, give them exactly the right nutrients, glass houses. We were talking about organic food. We will be able to grow almost unlimited food because of these advances in energy led lighting, ai and sensors. That's in the next five or 10 years. So we could literally have a planet that's abundant in energy and food that has perfect health in which we can three d print our clothing. All of these things are within reach

Speaker 2:          25:33          now that make get to the dark side of all this. And I talked about the advances in ai and robotics and sensors, industry disruptions, despite what the optimists say, despite what Silicon Valley says, I don't see a scenario in which we'll have enough jobs for human beings that yes, it will be new jobs graded zoomed by. Don says, and God knows what. That's a stupid example. Is that a tech mogul to throw up about the new jobs that'll be created? The fact is that these uber drivers, these taxi drivers in New York City, the even the uber drivers that we have here now, when the jobs get displaced, they aren't going to be new jobs for them. The truck drivers, you're talking about 3 million truck drivers in the United States when we have self driving trucks, which is very likely in the next five years or so. Those Middle East truck drivers who don't have other skills and driving are not going to be able to learn how to program robots or how to do Zumba dancing.

Speaker 2:          26:32          Those truck drivers will be unemployed. We're talking about people whose livelihood depends on jobs. Whose social stature depends on jobs. I mean, you know, I think about it when we meet other almost the first question we ask is what do you do? We're defined by our jobs and we take pride in creativity and in our work and our lives revolve around our work. What happens when work disappears? Even if you have all the energy you want, all the food you want, you have perfect health, you have all the things that you need. You're able to three d print your, your food and clothing and all that. If you have all of those things taken care of, you have nothing to do. You feel depressed. What's the new social structure over here? What did we do with ourselves? So silicon valley talks about universal basic income.

Speaker 2:          27:19          That's their excuse for saying it's someone else's problem. It will be okay. Let us get filthy rich and let someone else worry about the problem. We can just give money to everyone. No people just don't want. Many people want a purpose in life. They want to be contributing to society. They want to be doing good. They wanted to be be earning their keep. They don't want free money next, you know, 10, 15 years. I worry about him even as soon as five years, I worry about millions of people, 10 tens and millions of big people becoming unemployed, becoming depressed, and I'm really rebelling that, you know, go back to the luddite movement. So try to stop the progress of technology because their livelihoods are being taken away. I worry about his dog scenario. I worry about them wanting to burn down the, uh, the tech companies and to stop progress at all costs because their jobs are being taken away.

Speaker 2:          28:12          Strikes just like you've had strikes in Paris, you taxi drivers trying to burn down. Uber's, I'm exaggerating a little bit, but it turned to stop Uber's. You may have that in New York City. You may have a people whose lives have been displaced. You met people who have lost their livelihood, is now getting angrier and protesting. Look what's happening in DC. We have a government that's pandering to the extremist groups to the anger, right? I mean, it was unimaginable even two years ago that we will be accusing the White House of being Nazi sympathizers mean. This is craziness. I mean the allegations are not founded, but the fact that we can even make those allegations shows that something is wrong over here, that, um, the, the, the, the gap between the haves and the have nots has grown not only in money which is always talk about before, but also in knowledge, in culture, in values.

Speaker 2:          29:08          We're technical people who are watching this or technology literate that you get your information online, you watch videos such as this and you stay up to date with this. The people in Middle America, the truck drivers, the taxi drivers, many of them don't watch this and they're not up to date. We're doing nothing to mitigate the gap. There are policymakers are talking about taking things away, taking healthcare away from people, taking benefits away from people. They're not talking about how do we now uplift all of mankind. They, they think we have limited resources and we have to ration them, but they don't seem to realize that we heard it edited to an era of abundance in which we can now distribute the perspective of grading and uplift all of mankind.

Speaker 2:          29:56          In my book, the driver and the driver of scar. I tried to look at technology through three lenses and the purpose of this was to figure out how we can create the amazing future star trek versus the darkness of Mad Max. The three lenses are, number one, does the technology have the potential to benefit everyone equally? Can we make sure that everyone gets good healthcare from it? Can we make sure that everyone gets clean energy from it? Can we make sure that everyone benefits from the technology so that we don't have people being left out and we don't have anger brewing and then go back to movies such as war of the worlds. Go back to a lot of these science fiction horror movies in these movies. The rich had access to better technology that they had health, they had all sorts of good things that pull had nothing.

Speaker 2:          30:43          They were working in the mines. The outcome was always the same in all of these movies that the war ended up killing the rich madmax that the anger started brewing and rebellion started and the focus was to destroy the technology to do, do, to kill the rich. Basically, this is what happens in all of these dark movies. If we don't know, start educating and uplifting everyone within had mad max. The second lens is, do the rewards outweigh the risks? Is this technology going to benefit us or is it going to hurt us? We have to look at every technology to make sure that the rewards outweigh the risks. For example, gene editing Crispr, we now have the ability to alter life itself. In about a decade from now, we will have the ability to select the, the, uh, um, the feature that our children have. This sounds crazy, but we may be able to take pills that alter the genome of an embryo and give them new characteristics due to remove disease and to give them maybe extra Iq.

Speaker 2:          31:44          This is all becoming possible. Another question that if you do that, do not create the um, uh, the world of Gatica, that movie Gattica in which you had, you know, people who have enhanced and then you had people who want enhanced and the people that were unanswered. It's basically based on society and guess what, the people who want enhanced rebelled or we now creating super human beings. Are we not creating killer viruses? I will now creating massive joblessness and we're now creating all of these new nightmares with technologies. Do the rewards truly outweigh the risks? And then the question is, does the technology great autonomy or dependence? I mean, I'm a big fan of self driving cars. I drive a tesla model s and I can't wait to get into auto drive when I get on the highway because I want the car to drive itself.

Speaker 2:          32:29          Now eventually when I say eventually, probably 10, 15 years from now, we're going to be deciding that we don't want these dangerous human beings on the road is human beings get distracted. They text while they're driving, they get angry, they get road rage. The Russian, the traffic at the same time, they crash into each other. They're dangerous. We don't want these dangerous animals on our roads. Instead, we want to have smart ai and robots doing the driving, so we made it through the human beings off the road, which means that we've lost autonomy, right? We get angry. Gone are the tilt of driving, so on the one hand, self driving cars give us autonomy. Why autonomy? Because everyone now can get familiar anyway. They wanted to be where they want to be safely. Mothers can send their children to school knowing that they will safely arrived there, the that blind to people who are handicapped.

Speaker 2:          33:21          The old don't have to worry about having to drive anymore. We have autonomy like we've never had before because it's not driving cars, but then we lose another autonomy. That autonomy is the right of being able to drive on highways. So you have a trade off over here. The question is, does it lead to. Does technology to independence or autonomy? In the case of self driving cars, it's both dependents and autonomy at the same time, but we've got to figure this out. We've got to figure out what the tradeoffs are. So what I posit in driver in the driverless car is that we have to look at each technology technology through this. These three lenses, and what I believe, but I sincerely believe is that if we get these right, that if we now benefit everyone and we do things in a sensible way, we can create the amazing future of Star Trek that we really can get to this world in which we're now sharing prosperity. We're seeking enlightenment and others were working to uplift humanity. And we can do this 300 years old schedule.
