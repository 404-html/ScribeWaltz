Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          well I would say a smoking would be one, uh, eating to caloric excess would be another,

Speaker 3:          00:21          um,

Speaker 2:          00:22          being sedentary, uh, not moving around, not exercising would be a third. We didn't talk about exercise, but there's ample evidence that exercise is beneficial.

Speaker 3:          00:36          Um,

Speaker 2:          00:38          I think the other thing is what we were just talking about, your attitude and mindset. I think, you know, uh, being focused on negativity would be a fourth and I think the last one, uh, which again is what would be a more or less in this lifestyle area would be stress level. This level of stress that you maintain on a day to day basis. So I believe in it. Others a believe in something called Hormesis hormesis means is that a lot of stress is a bad thing, but no stress is also a bad thing and the optimum is something in the middle so that you're engaged on a daily basis. It revved up your functioning. Okay. But you feel as though you're in control. And I think finding that balance that me says, uh, is, is probably very important in maintaining a mental health and physical health. So that would be my, my big five.
