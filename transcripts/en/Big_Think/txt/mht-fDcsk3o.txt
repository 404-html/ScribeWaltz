Speaker 1:          00:09          Can I look back over time and you say, oh, things are basically improved for the greater lot of mankind. There's always been a lot of problems right now they're acute and we're more interconnected and problems can infect other parts of the world much more easily. But to date, the lot of mankind, I believe has generally gotten better. There's been big setbacks. Look at World War II, look at Chairman Mao's great leap forward, the dark ages, but in general, like the stock market, you might have a bull market in the bear market. I do think in the end, uh, you know, problems can be dealt with and that mankind will continue to improve on a whole.
