Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          California should do to fix its economy. I think first you've got to recognize California has enormous potential. It has a, it's a great environment. It's very open to new ideas. Silicon Valley, it's got great universities, great. Um, uh, both the University of California in the private universities. So the potential is tremendous. What we really need to do in California is to deal with a serious budget problem, which means spending, grows too much and then taxes rise and that tends to drive out businesses and ultimately as harmful to the state. So I would say number one in terms of the question is, is put some limit on the growth of spending population growth. Plus inflation is one way to do it, uh, that would prevent the ups and downs in the, in the deficit spending usually rises rapidly when tax revenues arrive and then tax revenues fall off and you've got this huge deficit.

Speaker 2:          01:09          So control the growth of spending number one. Number two, it put in some, uh, tax reforms to prevent the ups and downs and revenues to be so great. And here we've got a huge cyclical, a performance in tax revenues. So I would adopt some of the proposals of the recent California Tax Commission that a governor Schwarzenegger, I introduced, and Third Education, k 12 it slipping in California. I think it's not a matter of spending a lot of spent in California. It's really demanding more accountability. I'd like to see a program where there's more for teachers and less for administration on. I think that would do a lot of them.
