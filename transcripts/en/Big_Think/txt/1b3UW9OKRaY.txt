Speaker 1:          00:09          Moving into a completely new era of history, and I describe it in two ways, it's the end of the era of western domination of world history, but I hasten to add it's not the end of the West. The West will remain single strongest civilization for long, long time to come, but it can no longer dominate the world and the way it has for the last 200 years and the second aspect of this new era. Of course it's the return of Asia and while the return of Asia seems rather abnormal. Now actually if you look at not the last 200 years, but look at the last 2000 years, the two largest economies of the world have consistently been China and India. So if China and India become, once again the Rogers economies, as everyone predicts in the 21st century, it will clearly be returned to know and so we shouldn't be surprised. It's going to happen.
