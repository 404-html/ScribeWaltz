Speaker 1:          00:08          I think one of the most memorable moments was when I first saw her, cause uh, you know, I had seen many pictures, many videos of earth from space and being able to see that with my own eyes had a completely different effect and sort of almost sensing life emanating from our planet in the dark background of the space. It was a really memorable experience. I wasn't frightened. I've been living this in my head for many, many years. So, um, I've sort of had played all these scenarios, have flying to spacing earth and I think I was very prepared for it. So it was almost a completely a joyful, very happy, very exciting experience. And I didn't have time or you know, any desire to think about what things could go wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:10          Well, I'm the first designer, uh, which is a design that won the Ansari x prize that was designed by, well Javier and space has been commercialized by Virgin Galactic. Uh, right now I think their plans are for the first commercial flights to take place in 2012. So it's not that far away. And I think from there we will see a lot more competition. And I know many other companies are building, uh, you know, designing a new spacecraft for orbital and snowboard resolve flights. So as soon as we see competition and we'll see the prices come down and really an industry being created, I think space travel is a dream for many men and women. Um, I think it, you know, my trip will be perceived differently by different genders because uh, for women, uh, a lot of time not only, you know, space travel, it's not accessible to everyone, but this even less accessible to women, they're a lot more barriers for them, especially if they live in countries where things like space travel engineering, uh, any science and technology related fields would be considered a more male dominated male appropriate field. So I want to show them that there is nothing preventing women or making them less qualified to be involved in any of these fields. But the equally, I think men also get very interested because as I said, the space is not accessible today. Too many people. And one of my goals as my involvement through and sorry, x prize was to create the opportunity for everyone equally, men and women.

Speaker 1:          02:58          I say that a woman's right is definitely a key issue because you also see a woman actually in a way being very, very active in this movement. Um, it has been an issue, um, you know, over the past, uh, you know, years and, uh, the situation sort of fluctuates. Sometimes it's um, gets a little bit easier and it gets harder again. And uh, overall I think, uh, women in Iran are very resilient and I'm very proud of all the Iranian woman that are sending up for the rights and speaking out. And, uh, I hope that they will succeed and I'm glad that the international community is paying attention and supporting them as well.

Speaker 1:          03:44          At Protea. Uh, what do you want it to do is build a platform to be able to deliver Internet based application to the users, um, in sort of a mass market environment regardless of their skill sets or where they live. And you want it to do that so they can consume the information or the experience or the application to any media, that medium that they are used to using, whether it's a mobile or the TV or their pc or any other devices that could be created in a ubiquitous manner and making information and services, uh, ubiquitously and simply available to everyone will actually close the digital gap that exists today between generations sometimes and create new opportunities actually for current application service providers to address a bit much larger market place and be able to design applications that are more suited for this larger audience.
