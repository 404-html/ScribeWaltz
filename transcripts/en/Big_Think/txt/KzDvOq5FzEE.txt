Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, I understand that the New York fed is at the vortex of all the regulation that is supposed to occur with respect to banks. The New York Fed is the least node, but most important regulatory body out there. It oversees all the financial institutions, controls, access to borrowing for these institutions and actually has, has individuals from the New York fed present at each of the bags so it can see and hear and feel what's going on in the marketplace and yet it failed abject late to see what was going on in terms of leverage, in terms of risk exposure, et cetera. Now this is all while Tim Geithner was president of the New York fed and Tim Geithner said when he was being confirmed for treasury secretary, he had never been a regulator, which should have been not just a flare, it should have been an exploding missile saying this guy didn't understand his job and I think he has failed as treasury secretary is a consequence.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Put that aside for a moment. The Aig Tobacco and the bailout of Aig, where $180 billion of tax money was funneled through Aig. Much of it then being passed through aig to the counter parties. Everybody from Goldman Sachs on down or given 100 cents on the dollar on credit default swaps they had bought from Aig for no apparent reason. Goldman was given a check for 12 point $9 billion, which is parenthetically just about precisely the profit they booked last year. Calendar Year Oh nine so the entirety of Goldman's profit you can think of as a tax payer and fusion. Why did we give that to them now? Geitner and blankfein would say because we were owed oded, why? No, there's what possible reason was there for taxpayers to give Goldman Sachs that money. I want to see what their conversation was back and forth. Would Goldman have failed absent that in fusion? Did we negotiate with Goldman in return and get stock, get warrants? Did we negotiate the amount of the payment? Why a hundred cents on the dollar? All sorts of other people have been taken huge financial hits. Why did Goldman get paid off? There are many, many areas of inquiry that would be exposed and would be explained if we could break through and see aig is emails radiating out into the regulatory and financial sector.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Let me make it clear. I don't think Tim Geitner is a bad person by any stretch of the imagination as he's, he's not corrupt. He's not taking bags of cash. He's, he's not morally in any way suspect. He's just wrong. And as I say, there's no crime in being wrong. We are all wrong, uh, at one point or another in varying degrees. And I'm certainly in that category as well, is as everybody knows. And so he was wrong. And so when I say he failed his treasury secretary, it has failed as treasury secretary and is president of the New York Fed. It's because he did not bring the right set of principles and an understanding of what his regulatory role was supposed to be. He embraced the Alan Greenspan worldview of let them do what they want because the marketplace, somehow we'll provide a magic answer. And that I think is the intellectual error that, that he has committed along with Larry Summers and again, extraordinarily smart, brilliant individual but just wrong. And you know, there's no crime in being wrong, but I think that they've taken us to a point in terms of economic policy that is not good and we have all paid a price in terms of the cataclysm of the past two years.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Understand that when the meltdown occurred. And so let's begin at the point of the meltdown prior to the meltdown, to give you a quick answer on that, leverage was completely out of control there. There should have been dramatic limitations in a, in back of leverage. There should have been a redefinition of what banks that had access to the federal window, Federal Reserve Window in terms of tax gain, gaining access to federal guarantees in actual cash could do with that money. And that's prospectively as well. So retrospectively they failed to control that, the leverage and the risk that was coursing through the system. And that's why we refer to it as systemic risk prospectively. The fundamental reform we need and put, thankfully the president has now begun to listen to Paul Volcker much more than to Tim Geithner and Larry Summers on this. We're beginning to say to banks, we will know no longer permit you to ask taxpayers to cover the downside while you keep the upside.

Speaker 1:          04:32          It knows the asymmetry between risk and reward is what led to the massive overleveraging and overexposure of the system. It's what we would have called it somebody else's line, not mine. We've socialized risk and privatized gain and anytime I can play with a huge pile of money and if I lose, it's your problem. But if I win, I keep the upside. Of course I'm going to get involved in much riskier investments than I should and so we need to correct that balance. Scale back the leverage. Tell the banks do what banks are supposed to do. If you want access to federal dollars to d guaranteed deposits, lend that money to people who will create jobs, who will be businesses borrowing to expand rather than using it for either hedge funds, private equity investments, proprietary trading, the sorts of endeavors that create great risk through the system. So that is one structural issue, which the president has now begun to focus on, whether it's post Massachusetts and post political, uh, you know, melt down or not, doesn't really matter to me. He's now getting that right. And I'm hoping that Geitner and summers or having their wings clipped too, because they're the ones who were not articulating for the president. The obligation to put that sort of reform in place.
