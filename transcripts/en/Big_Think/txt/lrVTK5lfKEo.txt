Speaker 1:          00:08          Probably the, uh, most important way of resolving issues. Is it face to face confrontation is a personal,

Speaker 2:          00:38          uh,

Speaker 1:          00:40          interaction. And far too often things are left to other sort of

Speaker 1:          00:56          others to try to solve what the principles should be solving these issues by direct, uh, interaction. Uh, surely it, we're doing lots of things, right? Uh, you know, one of the problems is, uh, you know, we, we dwell on the things that aren't right, because those are the things we want to change. Those are the things we want to correct. Uh, but it's an awful lot that's being done right. And I think in the last seven years, uh, in New York City, uh, as a whole different attitude about living in the city, about working in the city, about how you interact with people that you don't know. Uh, and that has to do with just a change of how things are done. Uh, both the, uh, from the public perspective as well as from a private perspective. Uh, as an architect, I can't say there's been a great deal of good architecture, uh, that's, uh, a resident in this city. But there's a different attitude about architecture in this city than ever existed before. It has to do with a feeling this is our place, that you'd be great. And I think there's that never existed before. So how do we cope now? We're beyond that.
