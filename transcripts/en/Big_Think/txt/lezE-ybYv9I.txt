Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          I think one dilemma you always have is a profession really depends on our being able to publish our work in peer review journals. So what gets published, it's really been gone over with a fine tooth comb and so we review each other's papers and you have to decide when you have a conflict of interest or not. And if someone's work is too close to yours, if they're a competitor, I think you have to stay away from it because there's an obvious conflict of interest, a little bit less obvious if you have people, uh, who's the people whose papers who wrote the papers from your lab there, former postdocs or students. I think that's also like a conflict of interest. And I think it's a, it's uh, there are gray areas work that's sort of close to your work, but I mean where, where do you draw the line of when it's okay to review someone else's work? We at a paper or a grant, uh, and when is it not? And when it's self interest, a creeping in. And, um, you know, I think it's very important that the peer review process, is this the best thing we have a that it be a, as pure as possible. It's never going to be perfect, but I think it's worth thinking about. And, uh, and it poses, poses dilemmas on a regular basis.
