Speaker 1:          00:07          What it is,

Speaker 2:          00:16          well, let's step back, what is it? Bio dynamic wine. There is a guy named Rudolf Steiner who, a founder, the founder, the bite, oh, dynamic one movement and he had very quirky ideas about making one, but um, many of these practices have proved to um, improve the sort of the vineyards, the health of the vineyards and that's what really we're talking about having healthy vines and healthy healthy grapes. He was interested in harvesting in the moonlight. He was interested in um, cow horns filled with dung, planted in the vineyard. So there's some quirky things that go along with biodynamic wine. Um, but, but basically we're talking about the health of the vineyard and if you have a healthy vineyard, you should have a really great one with organic. It's actually a tricky proposition because in terms of winemaking, you, what you're looking at usually is organic grapes, but there's an entire organic wine making process that sometimes wine makers will not carry through.

Speaker 2:          01:30          So is it. The labeling is a little dicey. So I think what we'll see is wines made from organic grips, probably not the entire process. The ones that are, um, that are green and that, um, are not always reliable are the ones that are made without sulfites. And so I'm in France, there's an enormous movement and there's wine bars that just have these, you know, great ones, green ones. I mean, without sulphites, those ones aren't very stable. Um, because the sulfites helped to stabilize the wine. So, um, that I think is where you can get an amazing, amazing wine

Speaker 1:          02:13          without sulfites. But boy, you have to be complete.
