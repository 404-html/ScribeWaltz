Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, like most people that don't live on the south side of Chicago or in Illinois, they're really. The first time that I ever heard of him was when he was running for Senate and we were looking at the New Yorker for interesting Senate, Congressional and State House races to write about in addition to the presidential race, and somebody mentioned this guy, Barack Obama, that he was interesting and he was quite possibly going to win and it was a state world kinds of bizarre things were happening in that Senate race. Remember the first real great event was his big democratic opponent. Blair hall disappeared from the race because his divorce records were opened up and that wasn't an edifying spectacle at all. And then of course there's this big speech. So Obama comes on the scene in 2004, unless you're a real Illinois political nuts and you know, he gave that speech. I went to the Boston convention in the summer of 2004 and he was pretty damn good. He was even better on television. He had really learned that, that fine art of giving a speech to a big crowd and yet not over projecting so that it would come off as shouting on television. So he was really developing these talents. Um, 2004, but I gotta tell Ya, there's no way in the world I thought he would be a presidential candidate in 2008, much less a successful one.

Speaker 1:          01:38          Well, we wanted to put out an issue of the New Yorker just after the election was pretty clear that Obama was going to win and they were going to be four or five big pieces. David Grann, Ryan Lizza, um, were among the riders in that issue. I want it to write about race. And I'd written a fair amount about race in my time as a journalist. And Ryan was interested in other things. Grand was going to write about Mccain and I'd written a biography of Muhammad Ali. I knew my way around, a little bit on the south side of Chicago because that was part of the Ali geography and politics. And I sort of took that on and I was intrigued by the speech that Obama gave in March 2007 just after he announced for the presidency at in Selma, Alabama at the commemoration of the great, you know, bloody Sunday events in the march from Selma to Montgomery.

Speaker 1:          02:29          And he declared, first of all, he gave his great thanks to what he called the Moses Generation, the Moses generation being the civil rights generation, the generation that gave so much opportunity to people that were coming down the line that succeeded on the civil rights act, on voting rights, on breaking open access to institutions like institutions of higher learning that Obama benefited from after all, he went to nothing but elite institutions, Pentaho's school, Occidental, Columbia, Harvard law school. This would not have been possible without the Moses generation. And even that went, which went for it. And then he declares himself the head of the Joshua Generation, his generation, people in their thirties, forties, fifties, who benefited from these elders. And he does this incredibly a ballsy thing. He says, I'm the leader of the Joshua Generation. And he goes right after the African American vote, because if you remember Hillary Clinton, the Clintons thought that they had a pretty good purchase on the African American vote because of their, um, long associations and Obama was challenging that.

Speaker 1:          03:44          Well, first of all, in order to get the Democratic nomination for the presidency, the African American vote is a very big deal. You have to pursue that vote and you pursue it hard, not Iowa of course, where there aren't very many, but elsewhere down the line, Obama could not assume that vote was his. Remember who knew who Barack Obama was at that point. Very few people, really insiders, people who had watched one speech from some time ago, he had to really pursue it. The Clintons didn't assume that they would win it, but they had a real historical purchase on it. They had associations with certainly with lots and lots of black leaders from around the country. After all, he had been president for eight years. They had done a lot of time in black churches and black groups and there was a real relationship there. There were a lot of loyalties and a lot of members of the civil rights generation, uh, and people of that generation in media and in show business and in business, people who are going to be donating money had long associations with the Clintons.

Speaker 1:          04:46          Um, somebody like Vernon Jordan, people who ran bet, so obama couldn't just jump in and by dint of is being African American assumed he was going to get that vote. He had to go out and win it. He goes to Iowa, which is a white state, and he won the Iowa caucuses running on the kind of appeal that you had seen in previous years. Like Gary Hart. In other words, he was appealing to kind of well educated, liberal leaning whites, party regulars, and they came out in droves from him because of the level of associate of organization in the state. He wins the Iowa primary and that starts to give people around the country ideas. Suddenly he's on a much more equal footing with Hillary Clinton. And so black folks in places like South Carolina, which is a crucial primary state, said, ah, I see. And that, you know, there was a chain reaction occurs now that's not to say that black people voted for Barack Obama and South Carolina because they had some kind of permission from white people, but black folks didn't want to be voting for a symbolic candidate that had happened before. They'd been many symbolic candidates. And there are even been Jesse Jackson in 84 and 88. There is no Barack Obama, by the way, without Jesse Jackson. Jesse Jackson role is false. Did an enormous historical good by breaking down the barriers toward the political imagination of having a successful African American presidential candidate.

Speaker 1:          06:20          Well, it's, it's worthwhile to kind of fact check the strangeness of Barack Obama's Beginnings in, in, in racial, ethnic, and identity terms. He grows up with the exception of a sojourn in Indonesia, in Hawaii. And if you've ever been to Hawaii, first of all, this, this feeling of great, almost isolation in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. And it's a place that prides itself on, um, on variation on, on a multiculturalism. People using that word long before it was fashionable on the, uh, on the mainland. And yet it's a multiculturalism lacking one very striking thing in American terms, black folks and most of the black population in Hawaii, the little that there is, is on military basis and Obama goes to one of the fanciest schools in the country of this, this private school called [inaudible] Ho in Honolulu, which looks like Exeter or andover, if you imagined it right near the beach.

Speaker 1:          07:19          Lockers outside, people walking around in this shoe. I mean, it's just fantastically. It looks like it looks like a highschool created by, you know, a Netflix of cello or something, you know, a beach fantasy of what high school could be. And he goes there and it's diverse in some sense. There's lots of Asian kids of all kinds. Um, all the various stripes that you see in Hawaii, but just a couple of black kids. And when he goes home at night, it's two white grandparents. So how does he learn how to be what he sees in the mirror. He pursues it by watching things on television, listening to certain records, reading certain books. He goes out and assertively goes after it and he does it then geographically by going to Los Angeles, but he's kind of in Pasadena and that's not good enough for him. He goes to Columbia, which is of course close to Harlem and finally ones up on the south side of Chicago and there he's finally able to find community community, a sense of purpose, a sense of idealism, a church black church specifically, and he really begins to solve these identity questions there.

Speaker 1:          08:28          By the time he gets to Harvard law school, these things are resolved for him, but when you go into public life, it's a question of how people see you. So he's got to struggle with these questions all over again. When he does things like run for Congress or for state senate.
