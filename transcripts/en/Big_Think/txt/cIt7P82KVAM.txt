Speaker 1:          00:07          Uh, I will leave it to their choice. I'm gonna say, what is your objective in world, uh, in life? What do you want to do? Eh, you want to make money, enjoy yourself, have all the things that, uh, uh, needed for your enjoyment, house, cars, a yacht or whatever. Um, this is one way. This is your success or you want to contribute. You want to have a meaningful interaction with the rest of the world that, uh, they feel that a, you are being useful to the planet and are useful to your fellow human being. So if you want to make a mark on this planet, if you want to be admired, if you want to be respected for what you have done, what your cap capability or creativity or intelligence has brought to this world reduces some of the problems or even remove some of the problems, uh, then social business will be one way that you can adjust that. Uh, all you want to be a big rich person who want to be on the top list of richest man in the world or richest woman in the world. That's your choice. But these are the two choices you have to make a whatever way you want to go about it. These are the options you have. You can mix both of them. If you're successful, you can make money the same time, uh, contribute to the world by using that money in social justice.
