Speaker 1:          00:00          The reason I put so much time and effort into creating teslow was, uh, because, um, it, it, it, it, it has always seemed to me that the, the, that, that transportation, we'll, we'll go electric and should go electric, but we have an unpriced externality in the negative effects of, of, of gasoline and, uh, on the environment and also in the, you know, the wars that we fight and, um, national security and that kind of thing. Whenever you have an unpriced externality, you can't quite, you can't quite rely on the market to, to do the right thing. So in order to have electric vehicles come sooner than they otherwise would it electric vehicles, we're, we're, we're always going to be the long term transportation mechanism. Um, but to make that day come sooner, uh, you have to bridge the gap with innovation. Petrus, the goal with Tesla is to try to serve as a catalyst to accelerate the day, um, uh, the day of electric vehicles.

Speaker 1:          01:04          And, and I, I think, um, when, when all said and done, I'm hopeful that, uh, historians will look back on Tesla and saint a tesla advanced that by, um, at least 10 years, which at that that would be a huge victory in my, in my mind. And solar city of course is on the assault, is on the energy production side of things. Um, uh, because it doesn't help if we have sustainable consumption of energy, but, but then that energy isn't produced in a sustainable way. And I, I feel quite strongly that solar power will be the single largest source of electricity generation, uh, by the midpoint of the century. Um, in fact, it just a simple extrapolation of the growth of solar power would, would, would show that that's obviously going to be the case. And also when you consider that the earth is almost entirely solar powered today, and that the, um, the fact that we're not a frozen ice ball at say four degrees Calvin and, uh, it is just due to the son and the whole ecosystem is powered by the sun. There's just an anybody amount of energy that we need to do complicated human things. This is a tiny amount of energy really compared to what the son puts on the earth every day, and we just need to capture a little bit of that and turn it into electricity. Um, so we have to try to accelerate that with innovation. And that's what soldiers things about.
