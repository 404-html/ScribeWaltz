Speaker 1:          00:07          They're begging. Doc is called after the, uh, Manassian bagans Israeli prime minister order to strike the Iraqi reactor. Tommaso ciroc back in 1981. Basically, the begging doc doctrine says that Israel would never accept the fact that a hostile country that calls for it's destructions, destructions holds the means to deliver this, this sort of operation, meaning Israel would never tolerate the existent of nuclear power in the hands of, of a hostile country like Syria or Iran. And you can draw your conclusions from that. That if worst comes to worst as a very last resort, if Israel is convinced that the International Boyko doesn't work, that Russia and China do not align with the rest of the world, that economic sanctions do not pressure Iran enough that the United States is not going to take action and Iran is getting too close to close to enable them. Israel with strike Iran. And I can tell you that long, not long ago, a few weeks ago in, uh, in, uh, classify discussion dealing with the Iranian issue, there's a special form of the Israeli decision and intelligence, uh, operatives dealing with Iran. One of them said that if worse comes to worse, we must bear in mind what the Israeli first Prime Minister David been going and said repeatedly that we did not bring the survivors of the Holocaust to Israel to suffer another, another holocaust, and we would do everything but everything to prevent them.
