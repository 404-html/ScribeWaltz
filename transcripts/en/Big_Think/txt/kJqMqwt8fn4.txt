Speaker 1:          00:07          The one that jumps out at me as frown, frown, checking Valerie Piper, Germany in the 70s. He play in the NASL for the cosmos. I think he played for the cosmos. You know, I don't know. I should know my history better than that, but, uh, he's just an amazing player. He's very graceful. Uh, his decision making was always, you know, very clever and, um, you know, and the way he led was, I, you know, I can't say say behind the scenes, but just in terms of on the field, he's always projected a cool and calmness and this composure that I thought permeated through the rest of the team. And I think that's, uh, something that I try to emulate in some regard. Uh, you know, when things are getting tough and things are hard, I may try to just try to find that balance of trying to bring it back the other way. And, and if guys I don't think are doing enough, then you know, I can be that guy too. And I think that's been the hardest thing for me because that goes against my grain is being this other guy. Uh, I have in me, but I never really bring out that much because I just, that's not really the guy I choose to be.
