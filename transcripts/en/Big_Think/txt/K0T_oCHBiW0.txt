Speaker 1:          00:10          Basically, there are a lot of people who say, Oh, we need new inventions, new breakthrough technologies for plugin vehicles to be practical. And our position from the start has been w they are way better than good enough to get started right now. The, the batteries we have and the motors and the electronics we have are able to make great vehicles. Uh, as you know, it'd be great to have better batteries someday as they come in. That's icing on the cake right now. There's a good economics case for a battery technology. And then on the other side, every alternative fuel needs a new infrastructure or new scientific breakthroughs except this one. Uh, you need new fueling infrastructure for a alternative fuels, for biofuels. You need to create more for natural guests. The same thing, but one of our big, uh, one of our big gimmicks we had when we started Kalkaska as we walked around with this and we said every alternative fuel vehicle needs a new in new infrastructure except this, the plugin card, this is connects you to today's infrastructure. A one 20 volt plug can power most cars. And when you get to a truck or a big vehicle, you're not, it's going to take too long on one 20. So you're going to need the dryer plug in your garage, a two 40 and you can do that. But the point is we have the infrastructure now, the fueling infrastructure for cars.

Speaker 1:          01:44          When cal cars was founded and we did our first conversions, uh, we put it all into the public domain and we enabled individuals to do their own conversions. At that point it was a strategic goal to get enough plugin hybrids around the country to show what was possible. Since then, a small ecosystem of companies has grown up to do conversions of hybrids of Prius's and that's a mock at around a million vehicles perhaps. So those companies are moving ahead. Some of them have gotten all the federal approvals and crash testing and so forth and they, uh, they have a business opportunity. We think there's a much larger business opportunity for companies to convert some of the 250 million vehicles that are not hybrids, the big gas guzzlers and some of the that was in the u s and 900 million in the world. And a lot of companies will do that where the federal government comes in and where local governments come in is in helping us get there quicker.

Speaker 1:          02:43          So right now, for instance, if you buy a new plug in vehicle in the next year or two, you'll get a $7,500 tax credit from the federal government, which will help a lot to bring down the price. Uh, there are other places in the world which have even higher incentives in that, and there are places that are using tax policy and so forth because the reason why we have that credit is not simply the practical reason of helping these companies get started and so forth. It's because the buyer doesn't get a lot of the social benefits that are driving a, I guess, zipper or a plugin hybrid brings. It brings some benefits to the whole society and reducing energy insecurity and and emissions and so forth. So you incentivize the buyer for higher first costs for those vehicles. Now, at this point, within a few years, it's very possible that the, uh, uh, it'll be cheaper to actually buy a plugin car than a regular car, and it'll be a no brainer at that point when we get to that point, the incentives will be less necessary.
