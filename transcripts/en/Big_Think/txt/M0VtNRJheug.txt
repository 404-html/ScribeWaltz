Speaker 1:          00:05          Legislators.

Speaker 2:          00:08          Yes, Percy. We appreciate that. We understand that. We know they publish that after you die, but we, we got the memo

Speaker 1:          00:20          by poets. He wasn't talking about versify or do you? He wasn't talking about folk who write words on a page. He was talking about all human beings who mustard imagination and empathy to conceive of an alternative reality given the nightmares, catastrophic driven realities. Most of us have to come to terms with which means to live a life of a certain kind is to be a poet, an artist of life and artists of living. One Who through ones deeds and actions and witness exemplifies and imagination and an empathy that is subversive in terms of relating to the past which just has four to two and courageous in the present to pass on to the next generation. Some wind at their back. If you're wanting to know what hope he is. Just zoom in and August of 1955 within materials. Mother, when she's asked to speak before, not just public but the whole world because the cameras were there from all the various nations and there's her baby in the coffin with the coffin open. They tried to make sure they kept a coffin closed. She said, no, they're going to keep it open. We just fetched his body from the Tallahatchie River in Jim Crow, gut bucket, Mississippi Keel by cowardly hateful American terrorists,

Speaker 2:          01:39          white supremacists.

Speaker 1:          01:40          We going to keep it open. This is my only baby. What you got to say Mamie till to the world. I'm not speaking on behalf of myself. She says, I'm not speaking on behalf of black people are America. I'm speaking on behalf of the bests of the humans

Speaker 2:          01:54          bcs, which is what I don't have a minute to hate. I will pursue justice for the rest of my life. That's been a hope. It's an echo, that magnificent moment and Ryan home neighbors, 1932 classic more men in the moral society where Ryan Hall says any justice. There's only justice soon degenerate into something less than justice. Justice must be rescued by something grander and deeper than justice. Mainly love, love, justice, not identical, but in the visible. When Martin says, justice is what love looks like in public, he's talking about it in the legacy of Jerusalem, not the legacy of Athens for Plato. Justice as a norm to giving and having ones do, but an Amos justice is a force, is a major force. It's an answer to the question of Walter Hawkins and his song, what is this? How do I count for this fire I have inside of me that want to give me any piece?

Speaker 2:          03:17          I've got to somehow get it out and if I don't do something to rock, so going to cry out, that's as substantial. I wouldn't even call it spiritual because we know religious folk have no monopoly on it. Given the history of religious institutions, accommodating themselves to the most vicious phones have beastiality and atrocity be against our Jewish brothers and sisters in the history of Christianity. It could be against Muslims, it can be against everything because women, I'm gazing levels of black folk or whatever. Thank God for the history of the heretics and the blast famous. That's my crowd. Look at the history of communism. My God, every self conscious Marxists finds him or herself usually having to leave the communist party in order to be true to the best of Karl Marx. Why? Because of the ossification and a pet to vacation of institutions in that way.

Speaker 2:          04:19          Hope is that substantial. Keep coming back to that point. And the issue of integrity that the boys raised is quintessential. And of course we live in an age of what? Cupidity love of money. I didn't say stupidity. That's too easy. Even though that's part of the problem, but it's cupidity cause it wouldn't be a Donald Trump if it wasn't for Wall Street corporate. He leads the Republican Party that was so complicitness and willing to adjust themselves to it or even a democratic part of this too. Milk, toast and acts like they want to be part of the resistance but usually have to be brought in kicking and screaming because the Deimos wake up and just hit the streets. The way the system is did the day after the inauguration night, it hit hit the airports the way our precious brothers and sisters in solidarity with and following, so call undocumented brothers and sisters. It's all those little ones we've been in the vanguard, those are the poets, the artists, the van guard of the species. Integrity over against cupidity and venality and the saddest feature of our present moment and that's why you all were so visionary because you all came up with this day and age of Obama. I see for a lot of people, they didn't need to talk about hope. I know Obama because Obama has already provided in the hope. Of course. I didn't get that memo.

Speaker 1:          05:53          That's another lecture. We're not going to get into that tonight. No, no. Well, I'm suspicious of anybody tagged the wall of speak military industrial complex assassinating American citizens without accountability. I'm critical of antibody antibody, the top 1% getting 95% of the income growth and 94% of the job that you brag about a short term contemporary, temporary, precarious jobs that somehow you're going to talk about the low unemployment rate. Why don't you just take a look at these brushes folk in these communities dealing with these two or three jobs, trying to put it all together. Start with the university with adjunct professors. Go Brag to me about how wonderful the status quo is and therefore death. Do you hope, but that's another lecture. My point is this.

Speaker 3:          06:48          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          06:49          My point is this, that everybody's for sale.

Speaker 3:          06:56          Okay.

Speaker 2:          06:56          Everything is for sale. Your glucose was right.

Speaker 2:          07:03          Pervasive, ubiquitous commodification tied to militarization in our relations with one another and the relations with police and local citizens, relation of CIA, State Department and Pentagon to Yemen and Pakistan and Afghanistan and in relation to undermine democratic regimes in Honduras in relation to Libya in relation to the West Bank under Israeli occupation in relation to poor doers, folk inside of Israel, given the increasing wealth inequality within Israel itself, commodification, militarization. And then of course nigger residx. What is Nigga realization? The attempt to make sure the dose slash don't call everyday. People are so scared and intimidated and afraid and feeling so hopeless and helpless that they'll never straighten their backs up. Walking around feeling is there. They can't make a difference. The voices don't matter. You can hear by the Martin Luther King, same from the grave it time ordinary people's straighten their backs up to going somewhere cause fuck k ride your back unless it bent. And that's an echo of the and Walden when he talks about the sleep walkers and it has the sleep, the focal walking on their backs and the when they wake up and stay woke. And that just they walked away. Our presses, young folk talk about it.

Speaker 1:          08:44          Black lives matter, but stay four to five as you awoke.

Speaker 3:          08:49          Okay.

Speaker 2:          08:50          Then the folk who are walking on your back find sales in situations that's called revolution

Speaker 4:          08:59          revolution. Mine Revolution and values revolution and priority is a transformation of self and community and society, and there is no transformation

Speaker 2:          09:14          without positive transformation, without this dialect to go into play of love as a form of death from which hope emerges in the form of action.

Speaker 3:          09:31          Hmm.

Speaker 5:          09:36          [inaudible].
