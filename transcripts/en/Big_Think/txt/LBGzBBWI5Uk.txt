Speaker 1:          00:06          Well,

Speaker 2:          00:07          first of all, I mean, mostly what I do is analysis and if we think about analysis, whether it's a book or an opinion column, when it works, it helps you read the newspaper better, right? I mean, it's, it, it's, it's not just giving people information, it's giving people analysis and connecting the dots between a few different pieces of information that creates that sort of Aha click of clarity. Um, and when you read strong analysis, clear analysis and it makes you feel better equipped, right? It's sort of ammo and um, so as an opinion writer, as a columnist, I know that that's my goal is helping people get more of those cliques of understanding because I think that we feel bombarded with information. We are bombarded with information, but we are extremely disoriented and the, what I'm doing now, what I'm trying to do now with this book is I feel like we're still in somewhat of a state of shock from September 11th.

Speaker 2:          01:16          Uh, and that a state of shock is about a gap that opens up between an event and, and, and, and our analysis of that event. And that's what shocked means something happens that so big that we lose our collective story. And I think the Bush administration has been really adept at heightening that state of disorientation by telling people everything you thought you knew before September 11th is wrong. We're rebooting history, we're starting over. Right? And if you think about what, what, what most people wanted to do after September 11th is they actually wanted to do the work to integrate that event into their story, right? This, this was an event that seemed to come out of nowhere, but nothing comes out of nowhere. So people wanted to know history and the, they were hungry for that knowledge that could bridge the gap between event and collective and enter collective story.

Speaker 2:          02:11          Um, so I guess that's what I see myself doing is helping that bridging process because when we're in a state of shock, we're very vulnerable to political manipulation. We're frightened, we regress. We think Rudy Giuliani's are long lost daddy, you know, I mean, this is dangerous. And I think, you know, good politicians were effective politicians, not good politicians, but effective politicians understand that they are very powerful in those moments when people are disoriented. So analysis a, it connects the dots, gives us a new story and orients us. Uh, and that's when we're better citizens. That's when we can engage in debates. That's when were harder to manipulate. That's when we're smarter, a calmer, more focused. Um, so, you know, that's what, that's what all analysis.
