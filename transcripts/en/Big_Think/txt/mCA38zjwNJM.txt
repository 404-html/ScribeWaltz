Speaker 1:          00:07          So Connor and I were in India.

Speaker 2:          00:11          We had flown there, we were meeting with their judicial, with the judges, have their supreme court. We arrived on that very day on that very day. Of course, people that were horrified and there was a tremendous outpouring of support and people couldn't have been nicer. And, but it was a time for a thought. And really it seemed to me the, the, the, and I mentioned it because, uh, what was in our minds after a week there, we spent a week there, uh, that the world is really divided into the f. What I think of is the forces of reason and the forces of non reason and the forces of reason. Well, law is part of that law as part of it. Judges are part of it. Lawyers are part of it. And so is everybody else on, you know, other professions, the forces of non reason, that's the risk.

Speaker 2:          01:06          That's the danger. So I rather see that as a, as a something that's unifying people across the world. Because people across the world do believe in democratic systems. They do believe in protecting basic human rights. Uh, they, they do believe in drawing to create economies that will be, make their people prosperous and uh, uh, they believe to a considerable degree in international settlement of disputes, things like that too, but therefore says that they have to fight against, which are obvious. So that's in my mind, maybe that's how I was brought up to, you know, it was after World War II and efforts at cooperation. I as you look out today, but also I'd say my experience tells me that in a way it's like this sort of somebody weaving allume. I mean, I'm not a political figure. I'm not in politics and I don't, uh, and, and people who do are, are in politics and in very high levels in government may see these international institutions and global politics going on at a very high level.

Speaker 2:          02:09          But I say to the lawyers and judges were technical people were professionals and at our level, whatever happens at the other, there is a kind of knitting going off. It's like workers at allume. It's happening in Europe, it's happening in Africa, it's happening in Asia. People are learning from each other, particularly in law. How does it happen? It happens at conferences. People talk to each other, judges talk to each other, lawyers talk to each other. It happens as different groups. Try to create laws. For example in Europe they are trying to uh, create commercial laws and bankruptcy laws and tax laws and laws that will govern several what were independent, they are independent nations but they're trying to get together and this is happening, say the World Trade Organization happening across the world. It's popularly called globalization, but what it involves or people in business, people in law learning what each other are doing and they adjust their laws accordingly.

Speaker 2:          03:12          It doesn't always have to be formal. We used to have a group called the uniform law commissioners and they go from state to state and they'd say, California does this. And I go to Iowa and they say, Iowa, you know, California does this, maybe you should try it. And that kind of thing goes on every minute as we speak. And then there, there, there are different organizations developing, well, like the World Trade Organization or, or there, there are dozens of them there. They're free trade areas are there, there, there are a health organizations, there are communications organizations, there's the internet, there are all these things we know about. They are all forces working to bring us together. So what I see as happening, and it's not a political matter, what I see is happening is people who are lawyers and judges in America today have to be aware and they have to have a system for being aware of what's going on elsewhere because of the cases in front of them will more and more depend on what's happened.

Speaker 3:          04:20          Yeah.
