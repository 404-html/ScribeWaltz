Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:05          The so called liberal argument, which is probably more liberal today than it has been in many, many decades. Um, you know, they argue that we should have equal equality. Everybody should be equal. We should all make the same amount of money. We should all have the same assets and well, I don't believe that. I think that's fundamentally inimical to free market capitalism. I think that's a kind of Soviet, uh, East Europe, you know, old communist socialist model that has never worked you, you can't make anybody everybody equal. They tried to redistrict it, redistribute income and wealth rather than increase it. Um, my credo here is instead of making the economic pie smaller and handling smaller pieces to everyone, let's make the pie bigger and get everybody a larger piece. And I think history has proven really since the fall of Soviet communism that that model of income leveling is a bad model.

Speaker 2:          01:08          It's a mild does work. It took seven years for the Soviets to felt fall, but they fell. And China, for example, the other big communist country, I won't say that they've fallen, but they've changed their economy. It's now much more of a market oriented economy in my judgment. Markets distribute goods, market set prices, and if there are free opportunities inside markets, that's how people who work hard will do well. And I think the ethos in America is to work hard. That's always been where we are. In other words, we all start at the same beginning. The starting line is the same. By law and tradition, we should be prejudice, free, color free, gender free, whatever. We all have the same legal starting line, but that doesn't mean we all finish at the finish line at the same. And I think that's human nature. So we talk about this in the book and in particular as you asked about, uh, tax policy, taxing rich people at high confiscatory rates has never worked in this country.

Speaker 2:          02:15          It's outside of our tradition. It's been tried a couple of times. Um, FDR tried it 1930s and it didn't work and the economy was no better in the late thirties than it was when he took over in 1932. Um, the war spending did help, but the great new deal experiment failed the great times of prosperity in this country. It's so when we lower tax rates and we shrank government, we put government in a lesser position. I'm a believer in the private sector. The government does not run the economy. We run the economy. So you go back and look at some unbelievable prosperity periods like the post civil war period. Unbelievable. The 1920s, unbelievable prosperity, the 1960s, unbelievable. The 1980s and nineties, fantastic economic growth. Those all have some common characteristics and usually they include low marginal tax rates. So you keep more of what you earn. That's a reward for your work and investment and entrepreneurship.

Speaker 2:          03:27          Uh, less government, fewer regulations. That doesn't mean no government. It doesn't mean no regulations. I'm for a safety net, but it means at some point you go too far and you're strangling businesses. You're strangling small businesses. And that's who I'm really worried about. So that's my basic argument. John F. Kennedy, to get right to the chase in this book, John F Kennedy's tax cut legacy has been lost. It's a very strange story and that's one of the reasons why Brian Dimitra rich and I wrote this book. Kennedy was the first post World War II supply side tax cutting president. He was the first Eisenhower wouldn't do it. And the 1950s, despite certain urban legends, the 1950s where allows the economy three recessions, and in eight or nine years, Kennedy knew having one by a cat's whisker against Nixon. Kennedy knew that he had to grow the American economy at 5% a year.

Speaker 2:          04:26          That was his target. Nixon didn't go there and Kennedy never really told us in the 1960 election how he was going to grow at five, but he said, this is what we're going to do. And then he went back and forth with his advisors in 1961 and 1962 the first step he made was one I disagree with. He had a lot of government spending lots and lots of government spending, safety net spending, infrastructure spending, you name it, which is liberal academic advisors. Um, uh, suggested to him that was their idea, spend, spend and leave tax rates high. You know, at the top tax rate was 91%. It's inconceivable. So you earn an extra dollar, you get 9 cents, but government gets the rest. That's a big number. That's a big number. So anyway, make a long story short or at least this part of the story.

Speaker 2:          05:25          Short, Kennedy had several Republicans in his cabinet. This is an interesting side note, but very important for today. One of them was a guy named Douglas Dillon who came from a famous banking family. Uh, just like get Kennedy. He has as much money as JFK, his father and his banking guy and owned the vineyard in south of France. He was Eisenhower's under secretary of state. Anyway, Kennedy puts him in the top tier Treasury Department and Dylan makes the argument that the liberals were wrong and instead we should give men and women more opportunities, more rewards, more incentives to grow the economy. If you get paid more, you're likely to work more. Or if the tax rate is lower on investment for a new business, if you are rewarded with higher pay after tax, you're going to be rejuvenated. You're going to get out there and go for the gold.

Speaker 2:          06:31          And that hasn't been happening since World War II hadn't happened in the 1950s. Uh, it was just throughout one number for it. It's in that book at 91% tax rate. So as I said, you make a, you make an extra dollar, you get 9 cents, right? The government gets a 91 cents. Now, Ronald Reagan as a movie actor quit acting because he decided 9 cents on the dollar was not enough for him to motivate him. True Story. Um, Kennedy cut the top tax rate from 91 to 70. So instead of taking home 9 cents on the dollar, you took home 30 cents on the dollar. That's an over 200% increase. And after tax income, and Kennedy argued he was the pioneer and I Reagan Kennedy, that this will create opportunities and incentives. They'll get government out of the way. It'll get people work at harder. It'll get them to take risks to start new companies.

Speaker 2:          07:35          Um, a lot of new companies, a lot of technology and silicon valley stuff was started in the 60s, uh, after the Kennedy tax cuts. That was his argument. And then 20 years later, the top rate was at 70, and Reagan cut it the 28 and two steps, 1981, 1986, 28. So now instead of getting 30 cents on the dollar, you got 72 cents on the dollar. It's about 145% increased. That's what I call reward. That's a basic economic principle. We don't work to finance the government, we don't work. Uh, unless we are compensated for the hard work, we might go on welfare, but that's not going to necessarily help the country. It helps the poor. But we want less poverty. We want more opportunity. So give us more after tax income. That's what Kennedy did. It's called an incentive. That's what Reagan did and it's called and a Saturday and both times it worked.

Speaker 2:          08:32          That's the thing. Kennedy, the Democrat, a lot of people said he was a liberal democrat. Actually. He was not. He was very conservative. But Kenny, the Democrats using a Republican treasury secretary, Doug Dawn Reagan, 20 something years later, the Republican, okay, who wound Democrats in Congress to get his tax cuts through. They presided over the best economic decades postwar. And it is not a coincidence that they both were tax cutters and we can talk about this later, but they also wanted a steady and strong reliable dollar as our currency. But incentives matter. The government does not run our, our economy. We run our economy as long as we are properly rewarded for our efforts and our entrepreneurship and Soviet Union. The Soviets, randy economy, it was horrible, horrible, rampid poverty. China is horrible. East Europe, horrible Latin America, horrible. And then came the free market revolution and things picked up quite a bit because people had more economic freedom.

Speaker 2:          09:38          And that's why I argue this, uh, I'm not even, I'm not talking politics here. I'm just talking straight out economics. 1970s Republicans and Democrats destroyed the currency, created double digit inflation and raised taxes. And the 70s were a horrible period of economic growth. We had 12 15% inflation twice. The economy barely grew. And then Reagan came in and change that. And by the way, just to make sure, this is bipartisan. Bill Clinton, Democrat, he did raise the income tax in his first year, but then he came back a few years later and cut the capital gains tax, which is a very important task for investors and risk takers, and he acknowledged that he raised income taxes too much. Clinton was also a free trader. I wouldn't say Clinton was Reagan's third term, but he's pretty close to Reagan's third term. Unfortunately, today, the Democratic Party's hope, hopefully, hopefully lost. They won't go through this. They want to tax wealthy people. They want to punish success. It's not the way America does it. It's not the way success is created.
