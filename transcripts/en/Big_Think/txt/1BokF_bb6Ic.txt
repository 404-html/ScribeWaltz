Speaker 1:          00:09          There's two different sorts of frauds as I understand it, to a fraud or corruption of just a lump them together. But you've got, you've got theft corruption in it. Just to give you, you know, could have a, um, an example. And again, I'm not, I'm, I'm not looking to be insulting to, to the various developing world governments and to say that they're all fraudulent and everybody there was fraudulent. They're clearly not in some very honest and a lot of very, very good people over there. But some of the challenges become that, you know, when the minister of finance transfers the money to the Ministry of Education, you know, there are occasions where some of the money and it goes the administer of education convinced that check into cash, that cash now's got to get distributed to the districts. And then the districts, I've got to then distribute the cash to the local parishes, then the parishes.

Speaker 1:          00:57          I've got to distribute it to the school masters and to the principals in the school. So you can imagine how there could be situations where some people along that chain of the cash take their time. Um, you know, along the way and when the, so by the time the people that the who are supposed to receive the, the, their salary that, you know, the hundred percent of the cash that was a given upfront to the ministry, there's only 80% left by the time it gets to the teacher at the bottom end. Now, these are the sorts of situations that have been described to me as being very typical. It's not, it doesn't, it doesn't always happen in every single place, but clearly these are problems. Um, and then when the young woman wants to collect her, collect her $80 leftover from the hundred that was originally supposed to get, then the, the person who was supposed to give it to her very often will abuse the woman until he actually gives her the money, cause he's got the power over the money.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Um, but in addition to that, there are also many, many ghost employees in the system because there are no very good checks and balances. So that's one element of the corruption and the fraud, which maps system we'll be able to provide a solution for. So, uh, the governments are very keen to underst because they'll save a lot of money because of the, uh, the people get paid, you know, kind of directly so that people will be happy. They'll get paid the amount that they're supposed to get paid. So they'll suddenly start finding that they're saving a lot of money. Um, from there, the time they send out their $1 million or whatever the number is from the top, that they'll find that that million dollars when they actually sent it directly to the people, a, the people will get the money they're supposed to get for, there'll be a lot of employees that didn't really exist.

Speaker 1:          02:36          So that's one level of corruption. There's another level of corruption, which is that you have to pay people to make things happen. And I haven't thought it through well enough to see kind of Kemet solution, uh, come and help out in that situation. I don't know if we can solve every situation, but in terms of the corruption and the fraud and the lack of transparency and the abuse of payments of, you know, government type payments to people. And the pensions, you know that not everybody gets all the pension that they're supposed to get because of the cash distribution. Those are the sorts of situations that map solution can provide a, a a great benefit to develop. We will government when people aren't identified, they just don't exist. And there's a lot of discussion before you ask me the next question. What about the privacy rights?

Speaker 1:          03:29          You know, kind of of the, of the people, if there's, if, if the governments are going to have so much information about the people because they have their biometrics, they'll know that I have the health information and then they'll have some, they'll have potentially access to some financial information. Currently these people don't exist, so the government has ultimate power over these people. The more you enable individuals to become part of a formal society, the more freedom they have, the more economic success they have. And everybody recognizes that economic success creates an environment of stability and peace. So it's very, very much in the best interests of the countries themselves that you know that, that they can have stability and peace. It's in the interest of the developing world to be able to create an environment where people are happy. People you know, kind of ended up that the people exist.

Speaker 1:          04:23          And from a, from a larger perspective, today we're dealing in an environment where there's very limited money available for an Oda in overseas development assistance. So the challenge for the governments is to find ways to maximize the efficiency of the money that is being used. And I believe that by, for the donor countries, whether it's partnering through the World Bank or a USA ID or deferred or all these agencies, their ability to identify private sector companies that will have their own skin in the game. And then I've got their own agenda to ensure some longterm sustainability of the projects, that there's the ability for these companies to leverage the donor money and convert equity to growth and create an environment where there'll be, um, long term success is the way that governments need to be looking at. Um, they're developing.
