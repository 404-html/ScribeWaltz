Speaker 1:          00:08          Religion plays a very significant role because what is most important to me about religion is I think it is the only secure basis for ethical and moral behavior and I think that as religion decay is ethics and morality, the k dramatically, and I think that often happens in history with material prosperity in, with lack of danger of generally speaking. And I think that's happening again. So I look to not too doctrinaire religion. I'm not, I'm not religious in a doctrinaire fashion. Uh, and the protestantism in the Christian church gave us that. So I read the Bible and the religious classics and I think of what they mean to me and what I think they should mean to other people. And it plays a huge role in my life in that regard.
