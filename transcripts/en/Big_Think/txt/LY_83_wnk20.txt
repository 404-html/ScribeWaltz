Speaker 1:          00:04          So when you're considering known ordinary or altered states, one of the first questions is what do they feel like what's actually going on in those places and spaces, and one of the challenges in coming up with a good and consistent answer, not just for a specific state like meditation or a flow state or a psychedelic state, is how do they all, what qualities do they all share? Because each of those communities of practice over central decades, centuries and even millennia, have accumulated their own storytelling or content about what the state and they access are or what they mean and where you're supposed to go through them. So for instance, if you were a Buddhist meditator, you will be instructed in all sorts of stages and levels and progressions of non ordinary states of consciousness ranging from waking state all the way to white light, voice to Buddha consciousness, etc.

Speaker 1:          00:56          If I am a peasant farmer in India and I have a non ordinary state experience, I might experience ganash right? That the elephant god in a rice patty. If I'm a peasant in Mexico, I might experience the virgin of guadalupe hidalgo, right? If I'm a coder in silicon valley, I might experience the matrix and code mode. This is ones and zeros streaming all night is I bang away on my keyboard and the reality is is that underneath those experiences are far more alike than the wrapping paper. The narratIve wrapping paper of what people see based on culture accustom biography and what we. What we attempted to do was create a functIonal framework that lets us talk about these things as apples to apples and really see the similarities and what we realized is that because of the neurobiology, there are four qualities that tend to arise pretty consistently regardless of which door you go through to get into these northern states and they a selflessness, timelessness, effortlessness, and richness or stir for short and selflessness tends to happen because the areas of our brain, specifically the prefrontal cortex, but including additional networks that connect often turn off or completely light up.

Speaker 1:          02:15          Either way, they knock out our everyday waking sense of self consciousness and self awareness. So we ended up momentarily lost our inner voice, lost our inner critic last, our jimminy cricket, and we are in a state of not thinking about our thinking. Timelessness happens for a similar reason as as basically different parts of our brain light up and turn off. Our ability to calculate time gets knocked out because it is a is a comprehensive measurement. It's not. It doesn't just occur in one single location in our brain. So when we start knocking out parts of the networks, we lose our chronometer and all of the neurochemistry, right? Focusing attention, learning drives our attention. We dropped out of daydreaming about the past or the future and we get absolutely sucked into the immediate present moment. So a feeling of timelessness comes with it. The effortlessness is just, it's no longer about what I'm trying to do.

Speaker 1:          03:14          It's not about exerting grit or will power, which has been, you know, a lot of people have been talking about and writing about these days and it's literally in the sort of almost in the biblical sense, sort of not my wIll, but thy will. I feel myself swept along. And it can be I'm just self propelled and it feels awesome or it's terrifying, but I don't have a choice, but either way it's not me plotting one foot in front of the other to get to a goal. I've decided so that's the effortlessness and then the final bit is rich is the richness and that's arguably the whole shooting match. Because when I knock out my self consciousness, I don't have a voice inside my head, second guessing, filtering when I'm not in the past or the future. I'm just in the deep present. When I am effortlessly being propelled.

Speaker 1:          03:58          The next thing that consistently seems to happen is we have access to far more information than we do in our regular waking state and that is when we go from conscious processinG, which is very limited and narrow to unconscious processing, which is faster and vaster. And Dr. David eagleman, who's at stanford, who's a friend and a colleague and a and a board member of ours at the flow genome project, will constantly makes that case that that really it's as if our conscious mind is sort of like the headlines of tomorrow's newspaper reporting on the reality of today and when we get into non ordinary states, because of the all of the shifts and brain function and, and hormones and neuro electricity, we have access to more of that information in real time. And, and the results often feels supernatural. People in the past historically have assigned this to the gods, to the muses, to fate, to possession, to angels. You name it, right? And we've preTty much exhausted the gamut of all the ways we could say, this is just too much. This is too cool, let's do inspired. It's too, it's too informed to possibly be me. So we've assigned it supernatural origins, but in reality we now know it might just be super hyphen natural. It's just us in an automated state. It's, it's, it's biG data for our minds.
