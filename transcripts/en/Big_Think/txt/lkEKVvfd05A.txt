Speaker 1:          00:00          Hmm.

Speaker 2:          00:05          That's an Obama administration has brought about change. I don't think that can be debated. There is everything from the symbolic to the substantive, you know, levels of what it would mean to have an African American president. And, uh, I think at the same time, there have been changes that were unanticipated, that came as a consequence of his presidency. And so when we talk about the initial moment of his launch, uh, into as a national political figure, which was in that 2004 speech convention speech in Boston, uh, he began that by saying, you know, there's not a black America or white America or a Latino America, but there's the United States of America. And you know, that was entirely untrue. You know, they were vastly different realities that very often corresponded to race, or at least were significantly correlated with race and ethnicity. And so, uh, what we've seen over the course of his two terms has been a means by which our period in which it's been increasingly visible.

Speaker 2:          01:24          You know, the distinctions that we see, um, as citizens based upon these elements of identity, who we are. And, uh, where we're from and what kind of communities we live in. And you know, what are racial ethnic background is, those things would come to the foreground. And I don't think that you could possibly have anticipated the extent to which they have done so. And so when we look at, you know, black lives matter and how it emerged, uh, one, it seemed kind of paradoxical that for, you know, half a century African Americans had been struggling, uh, specifically around the voting rights act to get increased political electoral representation. And at the point at which, uh, were represented at the pinnacle of American political power, it reverberates and this kind of a boomerang effect. And we wound up with a revitalized grassroots movement of people who don't necessarily trust political power, people who are outside the establishment, uh, and people who were attempting to kind of move the levers of political power to the advantage of a disempowered communities.

Speaker 2:          02:30          And one would have thought, I guess in a kind of naive perspective on Barack Obama's presidency, you would have thought that those things would not have been necessarily, would not have been necessary. Certainly some of his critics, uh, bought that he was going to govern in such a radical way that, uh, it was going to be, you know, reparations handed out in the first week for African Americans. Uh, and he's been very moderate and centrist and, and often reluctant to directly engage issues of race. I think that's what some of frustration who come from the younger generation of activists, uh, and they took his moderation as being, uh, in some instances inadequate to the task at hand. I think that there's a lot that's missing from the public conversation about race. When we talk about race, we most often confronted as an emotional reality, uh, or this kind of subject of, um, social anxiety or something in which we go, oh, you know, we're really all the same and you know, it's a ridiculous idea that we separate ourselves in this way.

Speaker 2:          03:41          Uh, which is true, but it's also very facile way of approaching that question because on a more fundamental level, race is a mythology. But there's also a very useful myth. And that's the only way it's been able to endure for as long as it has, particularly in the United States. Uh, and so, uh, what I mean by that is we look at things now when we talk about race, pretend to say that no, there's this level of mistrust or their stereotypes or misunderstandings. And you know, we have these problems and we should all just look at each other as humans. But the fact of the matter is that things like slavery and segregation and economic discrimination, these things happened willfully. They weren't the result of a kind of haphazard, mistaken approaches to people who happen to be different from you. And so it means that we don't simply have to dispel mythology.

Speaker 2:          04:47          It means we have to actually grapple with people having concrete interests that may be different than the interests of other communities. And so it's not simply implicit bias in policing that has resulted in disproportionate numbers as we saw in Ferguson. It wasn't simply a matter of implicit bias or stereotypes, or, um, good intentioned, well intentioned individuals who happened to have arrested or pulled over more African Americans and whites. We saw that there was an institutional structural approach to particular communities that were being fleeced by a police department. And so we can find those kinds of dynamics again and again and again. And so when we talk about race, it's going to be much more intractable than simply ridding ourselves of, uh, maybe some, uh, mistaken ideas that have rattled around in our heads. So sometime.
