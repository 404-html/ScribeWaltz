Speaker 1:          00:07          Well in the sense that I think we certainly understand that uh, we cannot, uh, we cannot continue to rely on petroleum is a major source of energy. Now there, there are two dimensions to our addiction to petroleum. By the way, let's start by saying that petroleum is our largest single source of energy. About 40% of our energy comes from petroleum. This is higher than almost any other major economic power. Most of the countries rely on other sources of energy or a, a bigger spread, a greater spectrum of energy. We are very petroleum dependent and, and this is partly because we were once a major petroleum producer. It was once abundant and cheap. So, uh, it was natural to rely on oil. But the, but that ended in 1970 when we became a net wet. Well, when our energy, domestic energy production peaked and we started relying on imports.

Speaker 1:          01:16          So we have a problem that we're very dependent on petroleum. Now there are two problems with, with our dependence on petroleum. One of one is that we have to get it from, from foreign countries. And that ties our foreign policy very much to uh, to, to obtaining more and more oil from other countries, many of which are unfriendly or dangerous or hostile. And that has led to the militarization of our foreign energy policy. I have spoken a little bit about that, uh, on one hand and there's a high cost involved in that. Also, there's a very big economic cost in the sense that we are exporting more and more dollars to pay for imported oil. And those dollars that we spend our, the maybe the, the largest single factor in our balance of payments deficit and that's contributing to the weakening of the US style or with respect to other currencies, which is contributing to the economic slowdown we're seeing in this country.

Speaker 1:          02:27          So our dependence on foreign oil is a problem, you know, and the other side of the coin or the other dimension of this is that oil, like other fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide. And insofar as we continue to rely on petroleum, we're going to continue to emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and we're going to have a problem reducing our greenhouse gas emissions. So we have a double problem. Now we want to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions and we want to cut back on our reliance on imported petroleum. And the only way to do that is to cut back on our use of petroleum period. And at this stage in the game, we really have no plan in place to do that. And that's why I say, uh, all these efforts, uh, for energy independence that rely on domestic sources of petroleum or a dangerous delusion, you know, leading us to think there's a petroleum solution. There is no petroleum solution. There's only non-petroleum sooner. Ooh,

Speaker 2:          03:33          Shit.
