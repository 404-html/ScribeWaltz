Speaker 1:          00:04          Some way. My book is an optimistic book because I argue about all of our, uh, our limitations and how empathy leads us astray. But in order to make that argument, we also have to have an appreciation that we're smart enough to realize that empathy could lead us astray and that we're smart enough to ask those to override. It's pernicious effects. So it's empathy that causes me to favor, uh, somebody who looks like me over somebody who does a tour or a somebody from my country or ethnicity over a stranger. But it's rationality that leads me to say, hey, that's not reasonable. There is no reason to do it. It's not fair. It's not impartial. And so we should try to override empathy. And my outlook is very optimistic. I'm a huge fan of reason and rationality that we can work together and deliberate and talk and argue and through this come with some great accomplishments.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So what I argue is that we have the capacity for rationality and reason. This is actually fairly controversial in my field. Uh, my fellow psychologists, philosophers and neuroscientists often argue that we're a prisoners of the emotions that were fundamentally and profoundly irrational. And that reason plays very little role in our everyday lives, which is to say, well, determinism of a sword, it's true. Um, what we, what we do, how we act, how we think is a product of events that have started a very long time ago plus physical law. We are just kind of pr. We are physical creatures. We are not, we can't escape from causality. So we'll just continue doing what we're doing. One of the main goals of my work is to argue against that. I think that notion is a more responsibility can we reconcile with determinism? But I think determinism is correct, but none of that challenges rationality.

Speaker 1:          01:57          And as an illustration, you could imagine a computer that's entirely determined, but there's also entirely rational. You could imagine on another computer is entirely determined but as capricious and arbitrary and random. And so even in a deterministic universe to question remains, what sort of computer are we? Are we are emotional creatures, are we rational creatures? But there is nothing, not the slightest bit of inconsistency between the claim that we live in a determine universe and that we're rational reasoning creatures. I think it's worked with science. Science is the paradigmatic case where the exercise of reason by ESD is imperfect. People has come up with extraordinary discoveries about the origin of the universe to origin of life, the atomic structure of material objects, amazing things. And I think we could do the same thing with mortality. I think people can argue and deliberate about morality. Now, whenever I say this and whenever I talk about about empathy, I always get a cynical response.

Speaker 1:          03:00          And the cynical response is I think reasonable enough, which is to say, well, that's not how it works in the real world. I was reminded recently that we're supposed to live in a post fact world right now. Um, the real, in the real world, people are persuaded by whoever yells the loudest, whoever appeals to their self interests, whoever tweaks their emotions, including empathy. And I honestly don't doubt that that's right. In a short term. I think that in any case, if I want it to persuade somebody to go to war against Syria, to give money to this cause, to expel that group from my country, I would appeal to their emotions and anybody who appeals to their emotions would be much more successful in those who attempt to make a rational deliberate of argument. But I think in a long run over time, reason and rationality tends to win out. I look at the world we're in now and for all of its many flaws and problems, I see signs of those moral accomplishments all over the place where I think we care more for people. We had forgotten about that. We have a broader moral circle as Peter Singer would say. We are less prone to kill each other as Steve Pinker has demonstrated in his work. And there's a lot of explanation for these changes. But I think one key component has been exercise of reason and I'm optimistic we'll continue to see in the future.
