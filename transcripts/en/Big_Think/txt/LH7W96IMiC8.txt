Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, the president should lead, you know, you can have individual states and individual movements, uh, deciding, uh, issues affecting the country. A president has to set it, Tom, and now when it comes to abortion, I believe that in a woman's right to choose. But as president, I would do everything I can to stop unwanted pregnancies to, to push for a adoption and sex education and family planning. Uh, but at the same time, uh, when it comes to gay rights, I think we should be a country that honors the fact that we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation as a Gobbler, uh, in our red state, as I say, which a conservative state I had fought. I have fought against those that want to discriminate against the gays. And I have got the most gay pro gay lesbian record in the country.

Speaker 1:          00:59          Not because it's politically popular. Actually, it's a very conservative state. But because it's the right thing to do, I would try to lead in those areas as president. Not imposed my will but, but take strong moral stands. Those are value stands. You know, we should be a nation of values and values are not just a religious values. Other values that we should emphasize is the right to have healthcare, the right for a child to be able to go to school, the right for anybody to pursue the American dream. So I would expand the definition of what constitutes value.
