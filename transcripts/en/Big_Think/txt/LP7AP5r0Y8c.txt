Speaker 1:          00:07          Real concern, a few things came together. One is that I spent a lot of time looking at the environmental trends and conditions. This is something that you can do in an academic environment. You have time to reflect, and I've been in this field since 1970 and I thought I'd look back and see how we were doing and what I found was that we're really a, despite his growing strengthen environmental community, the growing sophistication, the growing number of groups here, we find ourselves 40 years later on the verge of losing the planet, uh, have really ruining this place for our children and grandchildren, but the data point in the wrong directions. So that was one thing. The other conclusion that I came to, part of that really is that the way we're going about environmentalism in our country today is not going to suffice. We could double the efforts of the types of things that we do now in mainstream environmental racism. And it would improve things marginally, but it would not carry the day would not win where we need to win.
