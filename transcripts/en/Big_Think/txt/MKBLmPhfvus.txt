And he's in a very remote region, just south of the instrument pass, whether it was a dividing a range, um, between those Taliban held a series of hills that were Taliban held in a series of hills that were held by his villages. And he took us up to the place where his father had been sniped and well made it a big point of pride to stand at the top of the mountain where his father had been shot a couple of weeks ago and sort of almost daring the Taliban who were shooting at us from the, uh, from the opposing hillside. You know, we were sort of ducking and covering.

I'm a photographer, was, uh, unable to ride a horse, so he was on a donkey and, um, and it was terrifying. It was funny because I was watching him on a document.
