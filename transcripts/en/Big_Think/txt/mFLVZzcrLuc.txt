Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 1:          00:05          it's interesting question, what is sort of impossible to define, but sociologists have tried and their definition I think is really useful. Their definition is that coolness is a measured positive rebellion against an illegitimate mainstream and like thinking of that all in one big pile is a little bit complicated, but when you disentangle that it makes a lot of sense. It is a measured small rebellion. A little difference or distinction from mainstream that is considered illegitimate or bad. Coolness is a response to a mainstream. It is in many ways very similar to the sociological definition of a cult. A cult is also a measured rebellion to a mainstream that is considered legitimate. Maybe the best way to think about this definition is to think about it through the lens of dress codes for high schools, right? Lots of high schoolers when they attend a school that has addressed code, they try to break from that code, but only in ways that are measured and positive.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Right? So the dress code says you have to wear a coat with a tie and a button up shirt. Maybe they'll undo the tie a bit or wear a hat or undo their button up shirt. They'll have measured, measured rebellions to that illegitimate mainstream, but it's not cool to go to school naked. It's not cool to go to school dressed in some like, you know, like some sort of weird superhero for Tuesday. That's not a measured rebellion that is outright rebellion and that is not considered cool. So you need a measured rebellion, number one, but number two, the mainstream has to be considered legitimate in the first place in order for the action to be considered. Cool. So in one study, these researchers is something really clever. They told a bunch of students who are, who were departing from the mainstream, a dress code, and in various ways they told them the dress code was a initiated to honor a high school graduate who had died overseas in a war.

Speaker 1:          02:00          Now suddenly that dress code wasn't legitimate. It was a completely legitimate way for people to honor a fallen soldier and fewer students considered departing from that dress code to be cool. So it's very important to think when defining coolness that you need two parts. First you need to mainstream that is considered bad. People need to agree that the mainstream is bad, and two, you need the rebellion to be positive and measured. It can't be crazy. It can't be insane. And when you have those two things together, you have cool the difference between that which we consider cool and that which we consider cultish because they're relatively similar things. They're both departing from a mainstream is essentially degree. That culture all designed around this idea that most human beings are, most people in society don't get you or they don't get this important thing. They're not religious enough, they're not thoughtful enough.

Speaker 1:          02:57          They're not environmental enough has to be sort of the first principle of that cult. But we reserve the word cult for essentially groups that are too far away from the mainstream to be considered a measured rebellion from it. And so I think that's exactly the right way to think about coolness versus cultish Nus, is that we're all part of cults were all part of scent. We all disagree with some aspect of mainstream social or political thought, but the but whether or not other people consider us cool there cultish essentially depends on whether they think that we are departing from that mainstream in a way that is measured and positive.
