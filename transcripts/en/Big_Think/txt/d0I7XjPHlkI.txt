Speaker 1:          00:04          You know that old saying about the Fox guarding the hen house. So I like to tell it for a different version of that story with the backstory, you know, where the hens, regular people trying to live our lives and we had a guard of the hen house. It's the government wasn't perfect but it, but it did a reasonable job of protecting us from each other of guarding equality. Make sure, making sure none of the hens were pecking the other hands too much. And then came along last 30, 40 years, uh, uh, Fox and the Fox is big business and wealthy people and the Fox didn't like know the guard because the fox kind of one of the hens to itself, it was what the Fox do it bit by bit that garden, like it argued the government was bad, government was the enemy had defunded government at fought for lower taxes so government could do less stuff.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Then the guard starts stumbling away and bleeding out off the scene. Hens are unguarded and the Fox presents itself to the hands and says what a shame. Government is just not, not what it used to be. Not, not solving and not protecting you, not fighting for it. So efficient. It's so, gosh, that's so sad. Well, let me step in and, and, and I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm rich and I'm here to help. Well, rich people and wealthy corporations spent a generation waging a war on government, defunding government, allowing social problems to fester and allowing their own profits to soar. And then with government weekend social problems multiplying and their own pockets full, they reinvent themselves as the new replacement of government, which is, you know, instead of trickle down economics, we now have trickled down, change, let them make their fortune and you know, and then they'll just throw some social change down from the mountain.

Speaker 1:          02:02          Well, we have to decide in America, that's the kind of change we want. Uh, but what I do know is if you project that kind of change backwards throughout time, we wouldn't have created most of the change that we all take for granted today. I mean, if, if, uh, you know, there, there would frankly have been no new deal. There'd be no modern American economy if we had depended on the powerful to throw down scraps. Many of the most important things in American life had to be taken from the powerful and given to the mini. And it's, it's time that we reclaim that heritage. Again, I think it's hard to understand why populism is rising throughout the world without reckoning with the role of a class of global one percenters who are remote from their communities, more connected to each other then to the communities they live in, um, and seemingly devoted to profit and returns above all else.

Speaker 1:          02:58          The fascinating and complicated thing about this global populace moment is that it takes very different forms. I mean, here there's a very strong racial dynamic to it that is at the heart of it. Um, there are other places where that's less of a factor. In some places it's about, you know, internal racial things and other places about immigration and some places it's about all of the above. But I think what is undeniable in this country is that for 30 or 40 years, many people on the left and right have felt that things were not going right, that the country wasn't working for them, that it felt rig to them, that it felt impossible to secure the life that they were promised by this country. Um, and to give their children something better than they had. And that all that, while there was a lot of rich explaining to those people by the American elite that no, no, no, no, things are great trades, good trades going to not non trade trade's great cause we perfect.

Speaker 1:          03:58          So we'll lift everybody up. Globalization. Perfect. It's great. Look there's a couple of bumps but no worries. And the in the aggregate all will be well. I mean as though anybody lives in the aggregate, um, tech don't, ah, don't worry. Don't worry about that fact that, you know, everything got automated in your jobs. All went to Taiwan. Don't worry about it. We'll be better off on the whole. And there was just a lot of this kind of rich planning. I grew up and I remember studying these, this stuff in college, when I took economics classes, like I went to the University of Michigan, I was sitting in Michigan and Econ, econ 101 and I remember getting this lecture on how all this stuff was for the good. As we'd better off and right around us all around us in Michigan in 1999, the state was falling apart these long tectonic shifts where basically like work was disappearing and trade was not benefiting most people.

Speaker 1:          04:50          And globalization was not a walk in the park and aggregate effects. We're not really have any comfort to anybody. And how was it possible at the University of Michigan in 1999 with all of that evidence all around us that we could sit in an intellectual cocoon and explained to ourselves that, you know, rising tides lift all boats essentially. Um, there is a way in which American elites, and this is not just a couple of greedy hedge fund billionaires, American, the American intelligentsia also has been complicit in a false story about air, all things working out for people over the last generation. That wasn't true. And I think people felt that and revolted against it. And it's really, really unfortunate that particularly in the trump movement, the someone who actually tapped into that intuition, people have, that elites weren't maybe as sincere and fighting for them as, as they claimed that Donald Trump, instead of seizing on that anger and channeling at the institutions and people who had actually done that instead in this cowardly and sad and lowly and hateful way, deflected that anger onto Muslims and immigrants and women and people of Color and whatever, you know, that's the, the ultimate and tragic nonsequitor of American politics today.

Speaker 1:          06:12          People are correctly, people correctly feel screwed by an economic order that doesn't have as much space for regular people to make a life as it used to. But they have been led by a phony billionaire real estate developer to feel as though those problems were caused not by Goldman Sachs, but by black people. And that is the tragedy of this moment. And that's why it's going to take someone on the democratic side who was actually able to speak to the concerns of regular people about being shut out. By the way, there's more shout out people on the democratic voter base than the Republican voter base. But the Democrats I think have struggled to speak in the language of people who feel left out by the future. Um, socially, many of the most prominent Democrats, it's just they don't know and live among those people. You can, you can have a lot of heart and you can have a good speech writer. Um, but you either live in a world that has more Goldman Sachs people in it, or a world that has more union organizers in it. It's, it's, it's just as your real friends, as your, as your real fellow travelers. And I think people are actually good at sniffing who's who. And I think the Democratic Party needs to get serious about being the party of, of regular people who feel shut out by this age and that that must mean not being the party of Goldman Sachs in any way.

Speaker 2:          07:50          Mm.
