Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, the advice I'd give and if you were my patient I'd be a little different cause we'd have a little more time, but if I can distill it down to the essence of what we do and of course of therapy, the person with panic, I can say this from the inside out, since you're looking at a panic disordered person in recovery, uh, has adopted a posture with regard to the world with the end in which they're on anxiety is their enemy and they think that if they can just get the anxiety to go down, go away, not occur as much or not accrual with such an intensity or at least not occur here or there and that situation, that then things would be better. In fact, all of that is not the solution to the problem. It is the problem holding anxiety is your own enemy and that it has to go down, diminish it, go away and not happen.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Here is a kind of self invalidating, interiorly focused process that would get you even more entangled with these processes. Instead, what we're going to need to learn to do is to allow your history to bring into the present thoughts and feelings and memories and just sort of hold them mindfully and compassionately and then focus on what you do and bring them along for that journey. So you know, uh, feelings or only your history being occasion by the present moment. If that's your enemy, then your history is your enemy. If sensations or enemy, your body's your enemy. If memories your enemy, you better have a way of controlling your mind in such a way that you never are reminded of things that are painful from the past. Well, there is no such thing like that. That's healthy. And most of the things that people do that are called psychopathology are the unhealthy things people do when they try to accomplish that agenda.

Speaker 1:          01:57          If you avoid people, avoid having your buttons pushed, avoid going to places that might occasion anxiety. If you're hammering down drugs and alcohol. These are all methods of trying to amount that unhealthy agenda. So I would say, could we instead take this anxiety to be something that may be of importance? May even be meaningful. And it says something about your history and could we learned to sort of hold it in a way that's more compassionate, to sort of bring the frightened part of view close and treat it with some dignity and keep focused instead of making that go go away focused instead on what kind of life you want to live connected to, what kind of meaning and purpose that's going to be quicker, more self compassionate and more certain journey forward than this kind of out with anxiety in with the relaxation, you know, out with the self doubt in the confidence kind of, uh, let's just snap out of it. Kind of a harsh and, and, uh, uh, lack of, uh, non-compassionate that place that we stand with ourselves inside. Things like panic disorder.

Speaker 2:          03:19          Yeah.
