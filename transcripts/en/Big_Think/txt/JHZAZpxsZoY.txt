Speaker 1:          00:08          You know, the book is not played out, the idea of what a book can be is not played out in its form as it is with paper and covers and um, and there are things that can be, that digital will never touch and that's one of the things I wanted to do with this and comparing it to a cassette tape, the old fashioned way of making a mix tape, which, you know, I love burning cds too, but there is something far more passionate and hands on and hard work about making a mix tape on a cassette. A, it's too easy to revise with a CD and today's technology makes it too easy to, to, to change immediately. Uh, you can cover your mistakes quicker. I, th, I think, uh, I think it allows you to have the sheen of perfection around yourself. Uh, and with a old fashioned book or an old fashioned cassette tape, you can actually see all the flaws and imperfections and the bad choices.

Speaker 1:          01:08          Uh, and I think there's something we lose with technology when you talk about bad choices like costs $300, number one, I don't think anything that costs $300 can be called egalitarian. You know, how much of the world can afford a $300 reading device, a one percent of one percent of one percent that automatically qualifies for economically elite status. But what we're, what's really going on here, the reading public doesn't really know about all they're concerned about and all their defending is they're reading convenience, which I completely understand whether it's because of physical disability or because of personal preference or just the newness of it, why they love a digital book, but they don't understand the economic corporate pressures going on in the publishing world and what's going to happen. And this is going to happen on the Internet to, uh, we liked to pretend that the internet is free.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Uh, you know, we like to pretend it's an opensource culture. But as culture changes, as corporate, old corporate models of distributing information are changing, you know, I don't know why people assume that corporations aren't going to take over this medium as well because they can. And, and, uh, uh, so what's happening in the book world digital books is that these ebook companies, you know, Amazon, Barnes and noble, others that are rising a, they just don't seek to publish books. They're going to end up seeking the books to be chosen to be published. So, uh, this economic model, the way it's set up now is going to favor a certain kind of book a and publishers and being economically motivated companies are only going to be publishing those kinds of books and the divide between pop culture, pop writing and literary writing. Is this going to increase and increase and increase?

Speaker 1:          03:01          And it's going to make it harder and harder and harder for first time writers to get published in any form whatsoever where they'll get attention, who can find you, uh, who, who's going to find anybody. Uh, nobody's really arisen out of the Internet to become a major voice. Uh, they always end up getting a book published and then the book makes them a major voice, but nobody has. I mean, uh, I'm trying to think, uh, you know, I'm not Internet averse at all. I'm doing this, uh, I mean I love the Internet, but the fact is, is that it's a giant, giant, unfiltered library, which, which has the strength and beauty, but it's impossible to find people. And you what we ended up doing anyways, I go to about five sites, uh, you know, and I think most people probably do the same thing. You create this little small town inside the Internet and we end up in all of these little tiny separate communities.

Speaker 1:          04:01          Uh, Joan Jett and interview with Joan Jett, she said about the music industry. She said the thing that's missing now is anticipation. They see said that nobody gets in a big line outside of tower records anymore, waiting for that new stones album to drop. And nobody stands in line outside or a record store waiting to buy the tickets for the WHO concert. Uh, there's a real lack of community on the, uh, you know, in the Internet experience when it comes to art and you can't tell me and it's not true that communicating strictly through the Internet forums community and the way that being together does a, you're missing all but one sense. You don't smell people, you don't really hear him, you don't see him. Uh, and we're animals. We're creatures of senses and the Internet deprives you of many of those. And, and, uh, so, uh, I, I know there's new art coming based on this technology and some of it's happening and it's exciting and interesting, but there's nothing wrong with the old art. And I always worry and you see it with certain Internet folks, the way in which they're completely willing to jettison their past and the pursuit of something new. And that's what I'm worried about.
