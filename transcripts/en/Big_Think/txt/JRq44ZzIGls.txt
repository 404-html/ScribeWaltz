Speaker 1:          00:09          I think relationship with

Speaker 2:          00:14          he hit a low in 2003. The whole cast of characters apart from Bush himself has now changed or different leaders in Britain, France and Germany, the Italian moments come back again. Um, and I think, you know, the, the, the will in Europe is to make the transatlantic relationship work. And also I think the Putin now Medvedev factor is making your opinions here, remember why it's always quite useful to have the merit to be with the Americans and not feel scared or frightened were in the cold. What is preparing all these issues, a reason to deal with it. The Atlantic countries are working together. I, it's the case. This isn't a partisan point that Europeans have been absolutely riveted by, by the election campaign. Um, and it's free for all sorts of reasons. Uh, probably rooting for Obama just because he represented something so different from, from Bush that they can see the pr advantages at home and we just not say there will be unhappy with Hillary.

Speaker 2:          01:33          I think they would be fine with hillary to shoot because they got on okay with built towards the end. I think people forget just how bad transatlantic relations were in the first term of, of Clinton over Bosnia, which was actually very difficult time of need to. By the end he was fine. A Boma represent a different sort of America. Um, and so I think he would have an unusual opportunity. Mccain would also, we'll also have an opportunity to, because he's recognized to be a different emotion, uh, and uh, but I think it'd be a concern that he was carrying on the sort of a blustery sort of foreign policy. Whereas I think Europeans would like more diplomacy, heavy American foreign policy rather than one that just relies on sort of threats, actual use of force. So a transplant integrations aren't really that bad, I don't think. But people are waiting as indeed Americans are. And I think 2009 will will be potentially quite a quite an interesting year in terms of whether you can see new directions in western foreign policy in general.
