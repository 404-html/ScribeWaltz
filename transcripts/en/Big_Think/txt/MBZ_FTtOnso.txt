Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, I think with the onslaught of celebrity and our fascination with celebrity at such a high pitched level that fashion, which is kind of its younger sister or second cousin, um, that idea of celebrity designers are very glamorous. They dress store let's the red carpet, um, the handbag business has gone crazy. So the general population has really understood fashion way that it never has in generations before. And it's reached, I think a kind of celebrity, semi celebrity level where the designers, the models, uh, and even, you know, Anna Winter and the devil wears Prada have become large celebrities in their own rights that has elevated the fashion show to a semi, you know, Papa Razzi event where, uh, people can be photographed. Famous people go to the shows, famous models are seen in the collections and designers that are world renowned and famous are seen. I'm going in and out of, out of these shows and these tests.

Speaker 1:          01:11          The seeding is I'm slightly medieval process. Um, but yes, everybody likes to get the best seat that they can. And a lot of editors are very unhappy if they're in the second row or the third row, which is basically considered Siberia. So, uh, if you are an editor of good standing, you usually have a front row seat at the major collection. That's the major shows in New York for sure. Oh, the ORC leads that often, I must say. I think that's probably an appropriate place for it to be. Um, New York is a solid place for fashion. It's a consistently good place for fashion. However, it's not the innovator, it's not the real creative juice that we all seek and that the retailers seek to really get ourselves, makes us excited about the stories we're going to put your magazines and the clothes that are going to be bought and purchased in and ultimately bought in the stores.

Speaker 1:          02:03          I'm particularly this season, I don't think it was one of New York's best seasons. I think it was a very beige season. And with that comes a certain sort of banality. Um, there's nothing that glamorous and dramatic about the color of beige. Um, so I think that's kind of a metaphor for a little bit with the seasons. However, we do have a store and he's a major story. He continues to shock and rock and, and push us forward. And that's Marc Jacobs and indeed his, both his collections this time we're, we're very, very powerful. His Marc Jacobs collection, which I just looked at in person and uptight up close to feel the fabrics and to see the accessories. Um, and to really see what he'd done was an pastiche of ideas and styles and fabrics and color. And it was kind of Laura Engels and little house on the prairie on crack.

Speaker 1:          02:49          I mean it was a crazy apron dress, ruffled skirt, but done in lyrics and Lemay. So again, mark pushes the boundaries. He pushes the, he dares to mixed fabrics and colors and silhouettes and probably because he just doesn't care that he's free to do what he wants and he never repeats himself. Um, he's got favorite things that he does. There's always a somewhere, a seller all influenced, I would say, but clearly done a mark. Um, he likes to push people, he likes to shake it all up, you know, he was a famous famous for his grunge collection in the early nineties and he continues to really rock our world, but it's great and this show was vibrant, colorful, collectic, a real mix, kept everybody on their toes yet again, and is Marc by Marc Jacobs collection, which is his younger line was just as delightful and enchanting and if I was, you know, 18 to 25 and that was sort of my demographic and, and my age group, I would be around running, running, running to those two stores, into those boutiques to get those clothes.

Speaker 1:          03:53          So he really gets you excited and really makes you want to buy clothes. He makes you want the handbags. Fantastic. Everyone said the it bag is over, nobody needs groovy bags anymore. That's all passe. Forget it. Mark has just made us all realize that there is another bag and he had about five that were expect macular, um, in his bark collection. So I think New York is glad to have mark. I'm certainly personally, professionally happy to have him. He makes it exciting, he's on a level with the best designers in Europe, particularly Paris as well as Miuccia Prada in Milan, and really keeping fashion exciting and interesting and pushing it forward.

Speaker 1:          04:34          You know, I admire Anna winter so much because, um, because of her unbelievable power and, and because she does a fantastic job at vogue, but particularly in this question because she really tries to promote and spent a large portion of her time and vogue's time and effort to promote the next generation. It's just really hard business to be that competitive in, you know, these guys are coming up with four to six collections a year. That creative process is unbelievably challenging. I mean, think about an artist that has to come up with a whole of four to six times a year. I mean, they just don't, you know, they, they do the same thing. They moved, they evolve over time, over a decade, over five years. These guys are asked to kind of reinvent the wheel as well as learning their trade and trying to have viable businesses.

Speaker 1:          05:25          So it's really hard, I think, for the young generation to come forward to push forward some of the kinds of new up and comers that have been around several seasons. I'm disappointed to say that they faltered a little bit. They're not able to keep going with the kind of expectation that we all put on them. Um, but, but Anna and the vogue fun and the CFTA, the council of fashion designers of America really are trying to support fashion at that starting level to really give these young designers the support and the financial cash that they need to continue and also to sort of offer kind of mentoring program. But, um, no, as far as New York is concerned, that's why it's not been a kind of season of newness, but London, um, which is happening as we speak right now is and continues to be a real interesting place where all those free ideas and kind of crazy eccentric things that the English are known for are able to come out and have created unbelievable talent. So, um, I think London is really the place where you watch it the next best generation of designers.
