Speaker 1:          00:09          The first part of your question, live streaming is we defined it in first implemented it back in the mid 19 nineties, um, was a time based versus space are surface based organization of information. The idea was that every electronic assets you had, every piece of information, whether it was an email or an instant message, whether it was a file or a spreadsheet, whether it was a photo or an MP3, would appear in a single time ordered stream that mirrored the evolution of your life. So in principle, the first thing on the stream would be my birth certificate and an electronic version of that. My parents would put my records, school records, health records, whatever went on that child onto the stream. And the Stream is um, uh, continues to flow forward through time. I can deal with the future is available to me as well as the past.

Speaker 1:          01:05          So I can search in the past, find what I want. Everything is fully indexed. Um, if, if, when I schedule things, when I know things are coming up, I put them in the future when I have something that I need to return to that I don't have time for now, I put it in the future. So, uh, and together with that we had an interface, we thought it was important not to make use only of the surface of the screen, but to uh, present displays in depth that made use of the other virtual depth of the screen. So I wasn't looking at surface, I was more looking through a window into an arbitrarily large information landscape. So instead of the mouse just moving a cursor over the surface, it would be a robot vehicle moving through three space or some arbitrary space. Um, but the basic idea was symbol, just a chronological timeline, heterogeneous with absolutely everything on it.

Speaker 1:          01:58          We have seen it a commercialized in two different ways. One way, the one that I'm allowed to talk about that I no longer own. These patents, the patents have changed hands and the patents are now subject of enormous lawsuit against Apple, which is not mine because I don't own the patent I'm told is the largest lawsuit in patent history. Apple took these ideas. I'm not in a position to say they stole them, I don't know if they did or not legally, but these ideas are the basis of apples, a cover flow of the way they display, uh, originally. Um, uh, songs on itunes cover flow is now become a standard way of displaying files on virtually all apple platforms. Spotlight, which allows you to find files not by name or folder, but by content and time machine, which is a series of, of archive things without commenting on the legal aspects which are not capable of doing.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Those are, those are live streams. And there are other companies that have done similar things that makes me angry personally, obviously the money, but because of the deliberate failure to acknowledge work that, that we would have made freely available as academics. And that, uh, companies nowadays will not acknowledge because there's so much money involved. The same time on the network, there are thousands of groups that are, that are building live streams or live streaming it for themselves in their own way. We love to see this activity. There's a lifestyle blog talking about all the different life. So, so that's, that's great. And for that matter we're delighted to see apple do it too. Um, but when there are large companies that work on it, which is also the case with, with friend feed, um, with the, with the event stream on facebook, uh, which, uh, which is true with the aol aol Bebo Stream, which they actually call a live stream or live streaming. It's not, it's not as if we want to stop that activity, shut it down, but we'd like to see credit where credit is due, not just to me or even me mainly to me, but to the graduate student actually built the software, worked tremendously hard, published the papers, put them in, you know, made them available. And uh, we'd like to see credit.
