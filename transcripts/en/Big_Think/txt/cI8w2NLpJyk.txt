The Indian army stopped the killing in east Pakistan, which became Bangladesh. The Tanzanian army shutdown the murderous regime of Idi Amin in Uganda. Um, there was a UN force of 5,000 soldiers in Rwanda when the killing began and the commander of that force told the secretary general, I can stop this with 5,000 soldiers who did not have all of the high tech stuff that American, the American army deploys.

Um, other regional associations, other, other countries can, can do this work. And we should sometimes provide political support. We should sometimes provide logistical or financial support.

So it would have to be somebody else who went into.
