Speaker 1:          00:11          I think the big difference between Iraq and Vietnam, I said after we lost and withdrew from Vietnam, they didn't want to follow us home. I think it's very clear. If you read bin Ladin Sarkar ways are we're hearing these other people, they want to follow us home. They view Iraq as a stepping stone to America, so the dimensions of the conflict have changed dramatically. It's eerie in a way. Some of the comparisons to the early stages of the Vietnam War and the strategy that was used and the Rumsfeld strategy, there were both failed strategies and they were very similar and so the on the ground that's a little bit eerie. It was called search and destroy and Vietnam. They went out and killed bad guys and came back to base. That was what Rumsfeld was strategy was doing before then we got General Abrams says the head of the military in Vietnam and they went out and they went out and they secured areas and they stayed and they allowed the normal life to begin.

Speaker 1:          01:13          That's the same thing that ha that we know strategy in Vietnam under general, in Iraq under General Patraeus. We'd go out and we secure an area and we patrol all the time with Iraqi military and we don't leave. It caused an upsurge in casualties. They are now coming way back down because the strategy is succeeding. That happened with General Abrams to in the Vietnam War that people ran out of patience and demanded that we do nothing else, even though our troops had already withdrawn from the in this war. The question is, will it get Baghdad clock and the Washington Clark be the same and that's not clear to me. Although we have beat back the Democrats effort to set a date for withdrawal is shorter time ago. It was last week. I think the other part though that is most heartening to me use America is very divided about this war, but none of us are divided in our support of the men and women who are serving in uniform and unfortunately in the Vietnam war, it wasn't like that. So I'm proud not only of these young men and women who are serving because of the best of America, but I'm proud of America in that we are supporting these young men and women. No matter how we feel about the war and whether it's right or wrong. I think it's. It's something that's very, very important and one that I can't tell you how much

Speaker 2:          02:37          appreciate it.
