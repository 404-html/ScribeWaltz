Speaker 1:          00:11          Don't use that example and I think clearly it's a challenge to complete the whole a bicycle wheel around that happen

Speaker 1:          00:25          in the upper west side. Then the, I mean, especially to the north, you necessarily to work a lot to complete the uh, pedestrian and bicycle walk. We buy the water side. There are many, many streets were protected bicycle way needed because I'm, some even seems to be, I mean some were painted initially and now they seem to be getting rid of them like intense three days, you know, it's like getting a race. The ones that was painted so clearly. Clearly there is a space in New York, which is the real issue is the parking space for cars in the streets. I mean the United States constitution has as many rights people in the United States have a right to live without fear, without crime. They have a right to free education. They have a right to, to work, to have many rights, but they. Parking is not a constitutional right, eh?

Speaker 1:          01:32          I think it should be questioned more seriously, whether it's how to use this space, which has now been taken by cars, parking by the curb side is that small minority of people who are taking up these extremely valuable space in the streets of New York to park and I think in many streets do you call the red guard rail parking and make some much bigger side. We'll just make some fantastic protected bicycle ways in all directions. Some regulations I think also have to be enacted so that people can walk in with bicycles into, into the elevators and into the hallways. I saw that. I mean, if people can go with dogs or we shows into a, into a hallway or in a little later, why not go with a bicycle, but this New York, I think Manhattan in particular is the perfect city to, for everybody to move by bicycle and even in the, in the winter is possible in most of the winter with, uh, some, uh, some, uh, coats to go by bicycle level

Speaker 2:          02:39          everywhere.
