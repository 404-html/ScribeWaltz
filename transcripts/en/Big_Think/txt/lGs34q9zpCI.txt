Speaker 1:          00:05          The Reagan coalition was based on an alliance between, on the one hand, small government, you know, pro big business conservatives on the one hand and the kind of cultural resentments, especially among white working class Americans on the other, they held those together. It was a very reliable way for the Republican Party to retain national power. I think that's common glued. It's come unglued for a variety of reasons. 2008 being one of them and the Republicans had not much to offer their working class, you know, followers except what more tax cuts, you know, cut social security. I mean Donald Trump understood that. That was one of the reasons that he was able to come in and take the part tech, the nomination for himself. He understood the class aspects of all of this in a way that the republican establishment just did not, and they were coming forward with the all the old bromides.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Right. And he came along and said, no, no, no. Yeah, the tax issues, but we can even compromise the tax stuff. Minimum wage. Maybe not such a bad idea, but free trade, free trade, free trade. I'm going to be the man who can make the deals now that is not the typical republican establishment or even the typical republican line. Um, so he was able to look, he was able to move to the left, if you will. So he's on the left of the Republican Party. He's more like Bernie Sanders in many ways on some issues than he is like the Republican Party. At the same time, he's doing all the, you know, the xenophobia, the racism, all of that. So where is the, the center to all of that? I don't know, which is really what makes him, I think, and this is where the Clinton people have to be very concerned.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It makes them a very unpredictable candidate. It makes it very difficult to gauge. You kind of knew what you were getting with. Certainly if Jeb Bush had gotten the nomination or if Ted Cruz had gotten the nomination to very different people, you kind of knew what, what, what was there with trump who cheat, who changed position that he held at nine o'clock in the morning with great, you know, I'm great fervor. You can change it all by four o'clock in the afternoon. I mean, this makes it, we're not dealing in a fact based universe here. We're dealing in reality television. It's something that we, that no political consultant I think is quite figured out. If he becomes president, will he be able to do everything that he says he's going to do? No, we do have still have a constitution. If you suspends the Constitution, um, as you might imagine and some, some, some fantasy, right?

Speaker 1:          02:19          We were under great attack or something and he suspends the Constitution. Well then we have a crisis that we've never faced as a country before except possibly in the case of obsession in 1860, 61, um, where, you know, that was a, that was a constitutional crisis that ended up with 750,000 military dead. Um, um, I don't want to go through that again. Can trump do whatever he wants as president? Can he become a dictator only by suspending the constitution of the United States under the constitution mean that I'd say there are plenty of subject, plenty of checks and balances on him. Not as much as you might like that within the military. You know, he is commander in chief. So, uh, it, it would be a crisis presidency. Yeah. Every time you one of these movements and they've been, again, they've occurred before in American history. There's always an argument that somehow somebody has taken America away from Americans and we're going to try to bring it back, take it back from them and restore what was, um, that happened with the federalists in 1800 of that, the natural unnatural as immigrants.

Speaker 1:          03:20          It happened in the 1850s with Irish immigrants and you know, Catholic immigrants and German Catholic and Irish and German Catholic immigrants. And it's happening now. Um, something terrible has been taken away and they're trying to bring it back. It's appealing to people's fears. They're appealing, appealing to people's sense of, um, uh, appealing to people's sense that they are no longer, they no longer count, um, these appealing to people's sense of their, their, their resentments and grievances. But we've seen that before as well. I mean, this isn't, there's nothing new about any of this. Interestingly, it's usually a sign or it's been a sign of a political party that's about the cracked up. Um, and that certainly happened in 1800. It happened in the 1850s, in 1920s and thirties. The, uh, the old guard and the Republican Party that brought back the economics that led to the Great Depression, they too, are being bought up by a resurgence of nativism, which led to a law in 1924 that grossly destroy restricted immigration from abroad. In all three cases, the parties either collect entirely or they were marginalized. The Republicans didn't elect a president from Franklin Delano Roosevelt coming in in 1932 until 30 years later. And the, the, the, um, the president, they elected in 1952, Dwight Eisenhower basically ratified a new deal consensus. So, so this, this great, I'm making America great again. Usually means that a party's about to get, get under, you know, fall under great pressure. Um, it's going to, if not collapsing target, at least it's going to disintegrate or be pushed to the margins.
