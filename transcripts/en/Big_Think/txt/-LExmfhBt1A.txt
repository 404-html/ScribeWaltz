Speaker 1:          00:10          Well, I'm a philosopher, so I was thinking of soldiers in terms of there's the meaning and philosophical meaning of their stories, the emotions and the deep emotions. And I interviewed a lot of soldiers, probably about 30 to 40 soldiers, so the current wars and including some from Bosnia and Vietnam and my dad who's a World War II veteran and I really wanted to go beyond just stories about trauma of which many soldiers don't suffer though, of course we know many do, but I wanted to talk about the feelings everyone seems to come home with, of trying to make moral sense of what they've seen and done. Um, even when they do everything right by wars, best standards. So it was talking about the, the moral weight of war, memorial burdens of war.

Speaker 1:          01:00          Well, my dad actually just died, um, December 15th that the days I was putting the final touches on the book and I always knew he was a world war two veteran and a medic. He never fired a rifle a gun during the war, but always had this sense that war was hell. And he didn't want to talk about it like many of his generation, a member of a laconic generation. And um, when he died I was cleaning up as affects and found in his pockets, his dog tags and um, he never told me and I never asked. And so it was 65 years of carrying his dog tags. Um, they were an identity to be sure, but they're also a moral identity or moral burden. And I thought he really carried it silently. He thought it wasn't polite conversation to talk about the war. When I probed, you know, he would say, well aboard the Qe one, the Queen Elizabeth, the first and the Queen Mary, it was a slaughter house.

Speaker 1:          02:00          It was a butcher shop, was amputated legs and men that were really, really suffering, um, this one will have a leg in that one, Walt. And so it was painful. Tears would come down and I realized he never wanted to watch footage of the war and he wasn't traumatized, I don't think is very healthy, resilient guy. But if his war was difficult, it was so, for many. And I don't think war should be a private burden, um, whether it's a draft war or a volunteer force or your guard national guard or, or you know, a member. Well, contractors are, no history is complicated story, but go, going out. I'm going out to war part of the reserves. So he was, I think the, the, the, the, the unconscious reason you might say. I also have an uncle who fought in world war two as a marine bayonet, Oka Allah, really ugly.

Speaker 1:          02:57          And he did suffer ptsd, posttraumatic stress disorder. But the book isn't really about, about psychological injuries that we know about that are very acute. It's about the everyday ordinary mix of feeling exultant about the battle and exuberant and that it's your, the time of your life to, to shine for some and that that's the only way that you could go in and be a sniper who's defending himself and his buddies and to, you know, for, for victory or survival. And then also feeling the shame of, of doing what you do when you do it. All right.
