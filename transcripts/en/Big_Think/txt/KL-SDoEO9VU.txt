Speaker 1:          00:00          Have a very optimistic view of, of market work, which sometime is associated to, to Adam Smith is the view that you have self regulation of the market and the natural forces, natural market forces can take care of everything and in particular can ensure that inequality will never increase to such an extent that it becomes socially and economically and politically useless or even dangerous for that matter. Now I think in fact, if you, if you reread the Adam's meets or if you try to look at the economic developments route eastery you see that, you know, you cannot expect everything from the market. You cannot just rely on natural forces to solve all problems. And I think one of the conclusion from the history of political economy and the history of economic growth and inequality is that, uh, you need a strong public institutions in order to put these poor, full market forces, uh, in, in the, in the right direction where market forces can produce a lot of innovation, a lot of incentives for [inaudible] entrepreneurship.

Speaker 1:          01:16          And this is very positive, but it would be a mistake to, to, to rely on and count on these natural forces to sort of self regulate a themself. And, and if you look, uh, in in particular the period going to the financial crises of 2007, 2008, you have a very large concentration of economic gains in poor, relatively small group of the population. And I think everybody agrees today's as this has contributed not only to the stagnation of median household income, but also to the rise of ouch all debt, which in turn put pressure on the financial system and probably did contribute to fragilize the financial system with consequences that we know in terms of financial crises, recession and unemployment, which we are now starting to get out of this. But there has been many years of lost growth and the lost a lot of, uh, social suffering because of this.

Speaker 1:          02:19          So we need a strong public institutions in order to regulate this, uh, this market forces and the sometime, uh, there's really accessive face in these forces. There are cycles over history. You know, probably after the Great Depression after World War Two, people realize that market forces need to be a strongly regulated and then starting in the 70s and the 80s with the radio and, and touch our revolution. And even more so after the fall of the Soviet Union, we entered in the 1990s and 2000 in a new cycle of sometime unlimited face into self regulation of markets. And to a large extent we are still in this phase and a, and I sing the reaction to policy reaction to the financial crisis of 2007 2008 has been too limited so far. And this could happen again. You know, we've asked a lot to our central banks in the US, in Europe and of course it's easy to print a billions of dollars or billions of euros to avoid complete bankruptcy of the financial system, which is what happened in the 1930s and which and dinner peanut complete catastrophe. So it's, you know, it's better to avoid that. But at the same time, printing money is not enough to solve the structural problem that we need to sell. So, you know, the good news is that we avoided the complete bankruptcy and complete depression. But the bad news is that we did not really serve the structural problems, which might in the future create a new new crisis.

Speaker 2:          04:03          Okay.
