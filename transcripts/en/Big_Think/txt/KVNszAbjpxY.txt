Speaker 1:          00:06          I consider myself a New Yorker. I was born in the Great State of New Jersey at Perth Amboy, general hospital, but got out of Highland Park, New Jersey to go to boarding school at age 12. I knew there was a bigger and better way. A lot of us from New Jersey, you have a complex about being from New Jersey, but I have written myself of that complex because they all have to come from somewhere and sometimes our somewheres maybe seemed like nowhere, but that nowhere gets us to somewhere and it makes us be better. So I'm proud to be a jersey boy,

Speaker 2:          00:41          but you're making an assumption that Jersey

Speaker 1:          00:44          symbolizes something and I don't know what that assumption is. Let's just say that I wanted to make things and be something and try to create things. And where I came from had nothing to do with stopping or starting the. I just wanted to do something was driven home by my parents.
