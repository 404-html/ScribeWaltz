Speaker 1:          00:09          Yes, we have a foundation and the website, yes, dot org. It's a foundation. I started a few years ago and we started it because we wanted to bring self esteem back to Haiti and currently 7,000 kids have scholarships. We started something which is called hip hop, hip hop for health mobile clinics going throughout Haiti. I'm giving people HIV tests, giving them condoms, but through music there's also a children's prison program where we've went into these prisons, whether it's kids introduce chest took over the prisons, but more beds, basketball courts and these kids were reading. And um, every time I go down there and tears come to my eyes because I knew I wasn't the beginning. A lot of these kids was in gangs. Um, most terrible violence you could think about a yearly is actually the movement is really working and it's, it's the greatest thing is when I look at a kid and I noticed that I can rise his self esteem because someone rose myself esteem. That's why I'm here as yelling.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Well, the first thing is we have a documentary coming out which is called CRI. Haiti. And this is my work on the ground for the past three years. Um, I didn't leave the ground until I felt that the people on the ground understood what we was doing and was training. So I kept going back and forth, back and forth. And now I feel like we have great a great team on the ground. We have a great ngos, but to get it, it took three years of me going back and forth to Haiti. A lot of times when you starting foundations for it to really work, you have to be hands on for the first couple of years. And I'm in in right now. It's a natural will. It's.
