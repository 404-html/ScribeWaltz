Speaker 1:          00:10          Clearly, a religion has both positive and negative. The wars of religion clearly negative, uh, uh, the idea that you have to have something to believe, some things to think about, a important, obviously technological advances. Uh, I read a recent statistic which just blew my mind away that, um, today the average American has 10 times as much material resources as the American at the Americans had it, the civil war, um, which is just a phenomenal thing when you consider, and it's all because of technological, scientific and Tuck, the logical advances and the ability to harness energy, the ability to transform energy, just phenomenal driver in society. And again, both positive and, you know, we have better killing machines to, uh, and uh, so, uh, both of those things are, uh, I think phenomenally important. And you know, we didn't have much progress, uh, in terms of improvement in living standards for a millennia until really the development, uh, in the 16th, 17th century of science and the ability to transform science into technology.

Speaker 1:          01:24          And, uh, sometimes I think we don't appreciate the flush toilet enough. It's just indoor plumbing, indoor heating. I, uh, in the late 19 seventies and early eighties lived in Oxford in rooms that had no central heating. You had a heating coil and, uh, I think you get to appreciate central heating and the fact that you can actually live at 70 degrees all year round a lot more when you are freezing and you can't actually get to sleep because you're shivering so much. Um, and I think that's just a phenomenal thing we take for granted in our society. And it's been a very short time since that's been.
