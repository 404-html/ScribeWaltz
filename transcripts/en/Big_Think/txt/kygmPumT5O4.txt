Speaker 1:          00:08          It's really tough to answer that because it's very hard to trust your impressions in real time. I'm in the conservative world. Paper was starting to say already see, uh, it's all going to work in Iraq and everybody's gonna thank Bush for this. I'm skeptical of that. I think the war in Iraq will look like a mistake by Bush. Um, and that, uh, his, um, generally his, his approach and foreign policy to, you know, as shoe diplomacy and go with unilateral force will, will be seen as having been counterproductive and having decreased rather than increased American influence in the world. So I would predict he would be seen as rather unsuccessful president in the realm of foreign policy. I'm in the realm of domestic policy, but in my opinion, by far the most important thing he's done is, is uh, the no child left behind law, which has been wildly under covered by the press.

Speaker 1:          01:23          And that'll take years to sift out. But basically what he has done is it's a little bit like Nixon to China because you know, that are Republican president did. This is, say for the first time we're going to make the federal government a really forceful dispositive presence in the American public school system. And, and, and really this will be seen as the moment when we western Europeanized ourselves and went from being a place that, that where public education is seen as completely local function to, uh, making it a much more of a national function. And, and that'll play out in all sorts of interesting ways, whether good or bad. I don't know.
