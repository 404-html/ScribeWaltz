Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          no, we, we, we really see our role as, as a starting point for people when they're looking for news. Um, our goal is really to try and help people find the information they're looking for yet in that way it's, it's, it's no different from what we're trying to do with web search and it will show headlines or snippets or sometimes just the source named itself. And then when people want to read that story, we send them directly after the publisher's site. So, I mean, in a given month, just from Google news alone, not even talking about Google, the broader search index, um, we send about a billion clicks every single month. The publishers worldwide, because I mean, that's, that's really consistent with what we're trying to do. We don't have content, we don't have any editors and journalists creating stories. Uh, we're just trying to surface that great content that people are, are, are creating every single day, whether it's traditional sources that have been around for hundreds of years or are new startups that are, uh, that are just fresh to the market.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Um, and we have no intention of, of, you know, pain simply for indexing a information, but, um, I think sometimes there is a perception that a, it's an either or proposition that I can put my content on the web and make it freely available, but if I decide to put up a paywall it can't be, I can't make it discoverable and that's not the case. And actually publishers who decided to put up a paywall, um, can still be discovered within Google at Wall Street Journal is actually a, is a perfect example of that. Um, they've, they've, uh, since they'd been on the web, they've always had at least some set of their content behind a paywall and they've charged subscribers for that and uh, and that content has been available within google news and also within Google search as well. So there are opportunities for publishers if they decide that they feel that they can charge for that content, users are willing to pay for that, they can do that and still decide that they want to be discovered within google. So it's not a, I don't think there, there, there are a number of different options of how they can do so. So it's not a, I don't think it has to be an either or proposition. I think it would be a worse thing for, for the end user if there are certain searches, return certain information and other ones didn't. Um, but a publisher can decide how much access they want to give for different search engines and, and do that fairly easily with just a simple bit of code on their pages. Right now.
