Speaker 1:          00:07          No, I don't, I don't think so. I think there are too many clashes within each of the civilizations to talk about, um, um, a clash of it essentially as each of the civilizations to describe them. Um, uh, but, um, it is true that, um, that when, when I'm fundamentalists or zealots or Orthodox Ultra Orthodox people take over, um, um, a, uh, country, uh, then they're there. They will repress the moderates and the liberals in their own camp and then we confront them and that does, that does look like a kind of us against them. Um, but we always have to remember in those situations, the people who've been repressed, all of the liberal and secular Afghans, for example, who, who, who survive the Taliban regime, but we didn't hear from them while the Taliban were in power, but they're there and those should be our, um, our allies. And since we all, since we always have allies in the other civilizations, um, I think it's a big mistake to try to, to try to describe it as a kind of war of, of, of unified culture.
