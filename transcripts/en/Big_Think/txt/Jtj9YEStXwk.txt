Speaker 1:          00:08          I grew up primarily in suburban New Jersey, not far from New York City. My parents worked. And I think I'm very much a product of the middle class to upper middle class suburban environment that I grew up in a, in an environment in which a achievement in school and achievement in, uh, the professional world beyond school were, you know, very, very high values. Uh, and uh, I think that, you know, shaped me a tremendous list.

Speaker 1:          00:47          I usually say that I got into journalism because the family business, uh, my parents met when they were the success of editors of the undergraduate newspaper at Nyu where they were both a commuter students. Um, my father went on to spend his entire career in journalism primary with the late great, uh, New York Herald Tribune and then for 35 years at Time magazine. So I grew up carrying a little reporters pad and pencil in my pocket, just imitating my father and as a child. For me, a big adventure was to come into the city from New Jersey to visit him at the time and life building and send messages through the old pneumatic tubes. And Play Ping Pong in the hallway with the other journalists, people who I thought were these exotic cookie off the wall people. And I thought it was just the coolest thing in the world that my father worked with these people. Uh, so as a kid, I just assumed I was going to become a journalist because that's what people did when they got older.
