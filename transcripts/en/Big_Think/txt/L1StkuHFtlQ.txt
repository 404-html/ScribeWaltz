Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          the methods of developing drugs is sort of set up so that you know, you, you try to control for a similar group of people and you give them a similar pill, you know, but the deal is, um, we don't know anything about their genetics, you know, so maybe they have these certain enzymes in their body that like, really, you know, turn this drug over and turned it into the active metabolite, for example, that helps you. Or maybe you're a bad metabolizer and it builds up in your liver and causes problems. I'm the deal is the pharmaceutical companies would rather have, um, have their market not limited by 66 percent. They would just like to sort of create a drug for everybody, throw it out to the mass, the masses. And I'm, if it improves symptoms by five percent, well it's a drug and it's done its job. Um, but it actuality, whenever you look at it across the population, there's a significant amount of people that are harmed by that drug. The FDA tries to eliminate that as much as possible. Um, but you know, it doesn't always work.

Speaker 2:          01:23          I think that there are certain drugs that are, uh, that we should not be taking. Absolutely. Uh, in 2009, the FDA approved only 26 drugs, uh, 70 percent of those were me too. Drugs, drugs that were going off patent and needed to be remarketed as you know, the next purple pill, for example, in order to create, you know, a $400 a month blockbuster drug, a in exchange for a $4 a month generic. Um, I think that that is a very, very, very shady practice and it's harming our health, uh, in exchange for, um, creating a whole industry of profitability off selling snake oil and marketing gimmicks.
