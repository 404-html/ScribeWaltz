Speaker 1:          00:09          Cool experience of African Americans and the United States. Uh, you have to start with the experience of slavery and the vestiges of slavery in terms of the trump, the trauma associated with it. And I think that, um, you know, blacks continue to experience a trauma in, in, in certain ways, and certainly with respect to, uh, those who live in urban communities that are, uh, sort of a infested with drugs or that are particularly violent, those are traumatic situations that they experience on a daily basis. Certainly as we've seen and in recent events, interactions with the police can be, again, particularly traumatic. So when you talk about mental illness and the black community, I think you have to began with the experience of trauma and how trauma continues to abound and, um, and their experiences and their in their daily lives. I think that what happens for a lot of individuals is that they suffer in silence, um, with respect to having a mental illness.

Speaker 1:          01:26          And so what I mean by that, in the greater society, there are certainly a lot of stigma associated with mental illness. Um, it's sort of antithetical to the American ethic, which is to, you know, be strong and courageous to pull yourself up by the bootstrap to weather the storm, etc. I think the second part of that, you know, point is what's happening at the community level or the society level. And I think what happens is that within the black community, um, I think that again, you know, that ethic about what it means to be strong and courageous, um, is particularly pronounced because, um, of trying to, you know, combat those forces like discrimination or racism. Um, and you know, it just adds to the burden of, you know, sort of what it means to survive. And so then the person who is struggling with the mental illnesses perhaps not embraced or you know, warmly accepted because of their struggles.

Speaker 1:          02:32          You know, I remember, uh, as a, as a, as a, as a young person growing up, I used to hear about the person who was quote unquote sitting down south. I used to wonder what that meant. And it wasn't until I got older that I became more knowledgeable of the fact that a purse, that person was struggling with a mental illness or perhaps substance abuse. From a historical perspective, there's been a lot of emphasis and the black community, particularly in back families, uh, on keeping your problems close to the vest and the home, you don't share what's going on with outsiders. No one can treat you as best as your family can. You bring all your burdens and your problems to your family. And if you do take it any to any entity outside of your family, it's the black church.

Speaker 1:          03:28          The church is really important in the black community and make no mistake about it. It's a, a source of, uh, you know, sort of salvation and uh, and the healing and there's a whole collective support, uh, from, you know, you get from your fellow church goers and that sort of thing. But I think also what has historically happened is died. Um, the church has been defined as the place to sort of relieve your symptoms or to address your burdens. And so it stops there. And what I think needs to happen is that, first of all, I think pastors and lay ministers can be more trained, uh, and the signs and presentations of a mental illness. But I think that the church could be sort of a triage unit, if you will, such that it identifies those who have needs and it's that sort of first step and the sort of entree into care.

Speaker 1:          04:27          But it shouldn't stop there. I believe that culturally competent care is critical to everything. If patients perceive that providers are inauthentic and do not care about their unique circumstances, then they're likely to be turned off at our baseline. Providers should understand there the history of their neighborhoods, for example, or the history of the experience of, uh, of African Americans and Latinos, um, such that they can put the clinical presentation into context and understand what unique factors, um, are in play with respect to the clinical presentation and how that person is seeking to, you know, survive and live in the world as an African American or Latino. And so I think that it's the onus is on the provider to understand that context and to understand what it means, uh, for that person to live in that context.
