Speaker 1:          00:10          Has changed, now it's different, but it's difficult for me to compare it with Pushkin's time. My brother compared to with 60 s of last century, a 20th century because in that time point in Russia wasn't, I would say itself, maybe those have, uh, your readers, I don't know, part of the audience who read in Russian, they remember, uh, that this fabulous line by you have to shrink a, a point in Russia is more than a point or the point and either buy it or I see bullshit. Uh, and I remember that generations were fascinated with these more with this expression, but in a sense it's quite silly because a carrot than Russia more than a character or an Dunno our bread and Russia more than Brad and star in Russia more than the star. He's so, uh, today poetry is not more than poetry should be probably first period during whole Russian history when poetry occupies its own place. White models. I Degas, uh, like in a different culture. It is. So from an point of view, it's normal because point a, when it appoints, stands on the stadium and the crowds shouting, shout like, I don't know. They see, they look at the gladiator. It's a strange situation because probably not

Speaker 1:          02:19          was because poetry today shouldn't bears a not it's own load. It shouldn't, as I said, it shouldn't substitute free newspapers, uh, as it could be free in general. It shouldn't. How to it entertained people. It shouldn't,

Speaker 2:          02:52          it shouldn't

Speaker 1:          02:54          talk about, I don't know. Uh, something's not illegal, but something for beaten. No, it has to do its own job. Then lane aim go. I Dunno, out of poetry is to figure out what poetry, ece in practical way it is searching of the language always each, each poetry or in progress. I mean, which pull each bullet point is working on it is part of this general and quite ambitious a search of the language which give may be in, in case of success. Uh, and this could give, do they put him herself and to the old audience possibility to be closer to the uh, understanding or suggestion what the point. Describe the situation like these because

Speaker 2:          04:28          okay,

Speaker 1:          04:29          today in today's Russia, the points are in so dangerous for those who keep powering their hands. So it is with one hand with the other hand, those who have follower in their hands, they understand that the raw much more, many of much more effective ways of moderation of their relationships with people and people of art as well. And it's not so necessary to the directress refresh represents to redress people. So unfortunately I cannot answer directly to your question as you asked me. So I don't think that, uh, the poetry will in 10 or 15 years, the poetry will be the only possibility to see the truth to people know the difference. Different institutions and a, not only poetry

Speaker 2:          05:58          develops everything because.
