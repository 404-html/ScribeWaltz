Speaker 1:          00:06          Well, New York is a lot less dangerous now, or I perceive it as less dangerous than it used to be. And I think it's

Speaker 2:          00:16          gotten a lot harder for people to move here and start here. And, uh, I don't know, you know, people are always talking about the demise of New York, whether it was rotting in the 70s when I was growing up, or now that it's filled with hedge fund people and artists can't afford it. So I think that New York being in the process of failing in some way is a big part of the city's narrative. And it's good to know that it's still going on just in a completely different format.
