Speaker 1:          00:07          I think there is clearly a room at this point for a third party because the Democrats, since they've taken control of Congress, have done very little to build public confidence. The public approval ratings of Congress are as low now as they were before the 2006 election. The Republicans are carrying the burden of the Bush administration. I think it's wide open for an independent or third party candidates. See.
