Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, I wouldn't call it open. I close friends, you know, we, uh, she's been really helpful to me and uh, I have so much respect for her. Uh, I've had the opportunity to spend time with her a few times and I think she's one of the most amazing individuals in the world. Truly. Um, she's done so much good for the world and she's been so successful and she represents herself and, and frankly she represents black people really well, you know, she, uh, she's someone that we are really proud of and I'm proud to be associated with our. I'm proud that she loved my music enough to recommend it to my, to her fans and uh, it means something. And I think she's a great example of someone who has been very careful with our brand and has a name that actually means something that when she associates herself with something, it carries weight. And how many people can say that it's really impressive. And, uh, I'm proud that she's a decided that my music is something that she really loves her and that she finds worth recommending.

Speaker 1:          01:25          He has influence on global culture. I go to South Africa and Oprah there, I go to Europe and people have seen me on oprah. There. I go to my good friend. His mother is from Pakistan. A CC's me on TV. They're uh, you know, through Oprah and uh, she's influential everywhere, but clearly she has influence here in the states. Uh, I mean, I don't need to state the obvious, but her book club obviously makes a huge difference. A specific artists when they go on and perform their, they, their record sales go up, mine go up when I go on their show, uh, it means something to be one of her favorite things or something that she wants to promote to the people. It really does make a difference. And that comes from her being known for good taste, known for integrity and known for being cautious about how you would think actually because of so many, uh, different forms of media.

Speaker 1:          02:32          So many, uh, uh, disparate ways that people get information nowadays that the influence of one person would actually be kind of diffused in a certain way. But for some reason a oprah has maintained that power. Even as people are watching less TV and uh, you know, paying attention to the Internet more, even as people are getting their entertainment and all kinds of ways, they still listen to what says and a part of it may have to do with her audience and maybe they're, her audience is still kind of a majority women that stay home during the day. And so for them, uh, you know, the TV's on and Oprah's on, she's gonna have some influence on them and why not? I think she uses her influence for good.
