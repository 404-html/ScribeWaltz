Speaker 1:          00:07          Oh, I think so. Yeah. I don't think it's any time soon. I think we have to first be treated equally within society. Uh, and once we are treated equally within society, we then have an opportunity for [inaudible] to participate more fully. You think of it this way, there's over 500,000 elected official positions in the United States of America, 500,000 from local city council to water district and president of the United States. There's less than 300 who are openly gay or lesbian, bisexual, or transgender. So that's a long way to go in terms of represent elected representation of a community that is certainly much larger than its elected representation is within that community. Um, so we have a ways to go in that respect, but I, I, I think that day will come.
