Speaker 1:          00:07          I resist the notion that somehow China is special or different from every other country, except in the obvious sense that every country has some unique characteristics in terms of Chinese history. I know, I think perhaps a lot of people in the West don't realize that you only have to go back to about 1800 to find that China was the largest economy in the world and its per capita income was not significantly different from western Europe. You know, so China was a major economic power. China was a developed country. If you go back further to about 1400, you know, China had a major navy. It was exploring as far as Africa. Uh, so you know, China was a global power throughout much of history. And then starting sometime around 1800, we can argue about the exact date. You know, China went into a period of decline largely I think because it cut itself off from the rest of the world.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So it stopped having those benefits of exchange with other countries, which are, which are important for, for technological, advanced and prosperity. So I think Chinese people have a lot of in a pride, you know, about their past and they're in some sense embarrassed at the country, you know, really declined and became extremely poor in the 20th century. You know, you had the Japanese invasion, you had different European powers taking little pieces of China's. So I think, uh, you know, I think the Chinese people have a very strong drive to return to what they see is their rightful place in the world, which is a, a major economic and cultural political center.

Speaker 1:          01:45          You know, I think Mao was fairly effective political leader during a period where China was trying to unify the country, uh, you know, fight the Japanese and expelled them, expelled the European colonial powers. There's a lot of controversy about, you know, who played what role exactly. And I'm not the best expert to, to, uh, to be interviewed on the details of the history of the 1920s in 1930s. I think the important point is most people in mainland China think that Mao played a very important role in reunifying the country and putting China. That kind of first step in bringing China back as a world power. On the other hand, I think most people in mainland China, uh, think that he was a very poor day to day manager and after the country was unified in 1949, there was a series of quite disastrous decisions, mostly on the economic front.

Speaker 1:          02:42          You know, the great leap forward generated a huge famine in which tends of millions of people died. A cultural revolution was a disaster for most Chinese people. So I think, uh, you know, I think it's fair to say that by the early 1970s there was, China certainly was extremely, we know it was poor than Subsaharan Africa and I think there was a lot of resentment on the part of ordinary people about the condition and to which the country had fallen. So there was a lot of popular support for some kind of change of direction and Dung Sao paying I think was very effective in channeling that, that energy, you know, and quite quickly bringing about almost 180 degree change in economic policy. So, you know, China's really interesting laboratory in a sense that, you know, the same people in the same culture, uh, went down a disastrous road in the sixties and seventies, and just got poorer and poorer and people starve to death.

Speaker 1:          03:38          And then with a few key changes in economic policy, the same people, same geography, all of a sudden they start growing at close to 10% per year. So it's a very powerful example of what you can do with economic policy. Uh, but again, remembering that the underlying institutions are quite important. And I think China had a long history of effective government. It had pretty substantial history of private property rights. If you go back far enough, it had a long history as a trading power. So I think those things reside in people's memories. And once in a country like China, once you shift policy, uh, toward strengthening property rights and opening up the economy, you get really impressive results very quickly.
