Speaker 1:          00:05          We lost about seven years by the Bush administration dropping the partnership for new generation of vehicles that was coming along at the end of the Clinton administration much. I it under Vice President Gore's leadership actually, um, and moving to a hydrogen passenger vehicles, hydrogen, um, um, has its uses as chemical and chemical plants and the like, it might even someday be a reasonable fuel for, uh, for putting in fuel cells and vehicles for something that is centrally fueled, like say a fleet of school buses, but to have a hydrogen distribution system at neighborhood filling stations all over the country, uh, with reforming hydrogen, putting natural gas in each filling station. Reformers, uh, storing explosive hydrogen on a pumping, on and on. I had approximately said that I thought that was going to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. And I was talking with a former secretary of energy who's a big fan of hydrogen, um, not long ago.

Speaker 1:          01:26          And he said, no, Jim, not hundreds of billions, easily, way over a trillion, trillion, trillion there before you know it, it adds up. Um, whereas the only infrastructure change you need to drive a plugin hybrid is an extension cord, whether it's new solar companies, then film solar, Nano solar, solar coming off the collectors coming off the production line at a square meter, a second. Um, new types of wind turbines. It can be used on individual buildings and houses, not necessarily propeller like spinning turbans, but other designs, vertical designs, uh, uh, battery improvements, making quite plausible. A 40 mile driving on, uh, as a, as a plugin on overnight electricity before you need any gasoline. If you can do that in general motors, since that's what they're going to be producing in 2010. All right? That's in model year. That's just two years and a bit from now. If you can do that, you, uh, we'll see.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Well over half the cars in the country that are plugins driving effectively on no gasoline, no liquid fuel, because the average car goes just a little over 30 miles a day. And if you have a 40 mile battery Ballpark, you're going to be getting a hundred to 120 miles per gallon of gasoline. Now if you replaced that gasoline with 85% ethanol, and let's say it's cellulosic ethanol, so we're not going to add more and more to the corn crunch and so forth, uh, then you're getting somewhere up in the range of 500 miles per gallon of gasoline. And you don't have to preach at people about not driving suv is if they have an issue. Vinny, that's a plugin hybrid. And when it uses liquid fuel is running on e 85, maybe they're only getting 150 to 200 miles a gallon of gasoline. But for a chevy suburban, how bad is that?

Speaker 1:          03:36          Uh, you know, sometimes people need big cars. They gotta be able to have them if they need them. Uh, what the problem is not the cars, it's the fuel and people both from the national security perspective and from the global warming perspective or zeroing in more and more on oil as a big part of the problem. I think, uh, um, it's, uh, I think it's promising. Uh, I it, it's not something you can say is, is here within the next five years, but, but you will within five years see plugin hybrids on production lines. You'll see increases in production of alternative liquid fuels. You'll see most cars coming off the production lines being flexible fuel vehicles so they can use ethanol, ethanol, renewable, uh, butanol, et cetera. I think there's some simple things that government mandates are good for. Flexible fuel vehicles is one, the change you need is simply a little bit of different type of material in the fuel line and some valves and a slight software reprogramming.

Speaker 1:          04:46          It costs less than a hundred dollars a car on the production line. It's much less of a big deal than seat belts. Uh, Brazil, a few years ago, I think around 2002 or three, just ordered new vehicles shipped to them or produced domestically to be flexible fuel vehicles that could use either ethanol or gasoline in any mixture. Uh, in two years they went from 5% to 75% of the new cars being flexible fuel vehicles. So something that simple, I don't see any reason not to mandate. What is a really bad idea is for the government to mandate a solution to the fuel issue. It's tried it twice in the last 30 years and it's massively botched it both times. One is, it tried to come up, uh, with, uh, in the Carter administration, they tried to come up with a synthetic fuel operation. The syn fuels corporation. It was hugely expensive. It wouldn't have been affordable and less oil and stayed way up close to, well 70 to $100 a barrel.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Anyway. So in 1985, the Sovi the Saudis drop the bottom out of the, the oil market, I think probably in part to cause trouble for the Soviets, which was good because it was the beginning of the end of the Soviet he economy. But one of the other problems, uh, they, uh, created was they bankrupted the synfuels corporation, uh, which was understandable. And then we'd been through all this, this nonsense about the hydrogen family car, uh, for, uh, much of the last seven years. And the Bush administration, the government does not have a good record of picking solutions that ought to stay out of the business of picking solutions. What it ought to do is enable competition. Flexible fuel vehicles enable competition between other types of liquid fuel. Um, battery improvements enable competition between electricity and liquid fuels. As you can tell, I genuinely think plugins are going to have a huge impact once people realize that they can not only go into a showroom and buy a reasonably priced car that they can plug into their garage socket drive for much of the day on effectively penny a mile electricity because off peak overnight power is bound a nickel, a kilowatt hour and much of the country, five kilowatt hour charge.

Speaker 1:          07:14          So say it's something between one and 2 cents a mile. Nonetheless, gasoline now is 10, 12, 14 cents a mile. So you're driving, it's something close to one 10th the cost that you're usually driving that, that makes a big difference in some people's, uh, uh, budgets. And the other thing is that there's a concept called V two g or vehicle to grid, which after you charged your plugin hybrid, let's say you get a charge by midnight and I have a timer on it, you can make it available to the utility from midnight to 6:00 AM when, let's say you leave for work, for stabilization of the grid and for what's called spinning reserves. That is a power outages. Those two together are only about 5% of what utilities need to buy about. Been about $12 billion a year worth of fossil fuels, mainly natural gas because natural gas tends to be what is turned on and off quickly since it's amenable to that.

Speaker 1:          08:17          Well, you know, that amount of money if it's divided up fairly between the utilities and the, uh, and the, the consumers, uh, there's a, uh, a professor at the University of, uh, uh, Delaware Kimpton who is writing articles about this and saying, you know, you realize that could be something up in the range of $2,000 a year for the owner of a plugin hybrid. Now let's think about this a minute. Not only am I driving it a 10th the cost, but somebody is paying me close to $200 a month. Heck, that's a major share of my car payment just to leave my car plugged in overnight. Hey, where's that dealer's showroom? You know, so, um, I think once and different than utilities or, or interested in this and to different degrees, but in California, if you'd talked to pg and e for example, they are really enthusiastic about this, uh, concept.

Speaker 1:          09:18          So there could be a substantial interest in a lot of people, uh, in, uh, in moving toward plugin hybrids when sir available. There is no doubt Toyota has led the way with the Prius, but General Motors did a very important thing back in early January when they announced to the production of the volt, their plugin hybrid. And then a few weeks ago on National Public Radio, I'm Bob Lutz, a very senior, he's vice chairman of the board and I'm a man, very much identified with large cars and fast cars. Uh, he announced they're going to be in production on plugin hybrids in 2010. And, uh, you know, you'd have thought to from what he was saying about oil that he was president of the Sierra Club. Uh, it was just from my point of view. Great. Um, what's interesting is that Toyota got it early and I think gm has gotten it now, which is that for Americans they don't, and they shouldn't have any particular problem with the cars.

Speaker 1:          10:27          I mean, look, I had three little boys at a stage in my life where I was driving eight, nine kids around to soccer practice and boy scouts and so forth. I needed my chevy suburban people ought to be able to have the cars they want. The problem's not the cars, it's the fuel. And so as long as what you're doing is trying to persuade Detroit to increase the cafe standards a mile or two or three or four or five or whatever per gallon, what they're tying to do is ring more mileage by redesigning the car sometimes and relatively cheap, sometimes in a little bit more expensive ways to wring that out. But if you say, uh, and, and they lobby against it, and they probably could have been ordered to do it much faster than they've done it, but from their point of view, consumers wanted big, fast cars. So all the, we've had a huge amount of improvement in, in technology and vehicles in the last 20 years. Virtually all of it has gone in to speed and horsepower, not into, into fuel efficiency.
