Speaker 1:          00:03          I'm the Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law School where I've been teaching for

Speaker 2:          00:09          43 years. Uh, Larry Summers and I had a contest for who got tenure, youngest. I had been the youngest professor to get tenure at Harvard. And then he beat me by three right

Speaker 1:          00:18          maths when he got, I grew up in a frightened, I was born

Speaker 2:          00:26          on the eve of the Holocaust, 1938. Um, my mother, when my brother was born, my mother kept saying she didn't know whether she would have him in some bunker in the basement somewhere. We were all terrified of war and we were all terrified of what was happening to the Jewish community. It was a powerless community at the time. Hard to imagine today, but no influence in Congress, no influence, um, really in any aspect of politics. Um, it was a community that really felt that they were the guests in somebody else's country. They were second class citizens. They were tolerated at best and they had better behave. Uh, and it was a community of people who are very patriotic, quite conservative in their outlook toward, uh, many things. Um, people sometimes stereotype the Jewish communities being very radical, a community. And there are many secular Jews who were radical during that period of time. Some communists and socialists, but in the Orthodox community, I grew up in quite conservative, quite patriotic. Uh, and um, uh, frightened is the word I think I would use more than any other. Uh, the message I constantly got from my parents and grandparents was shushed. Still be quiet, be quiet, don't rock the boat, don't do anything. Don't make your hosts the real Americans mad at you. Uh, whatever you do do quietly. Obviously it didn't take with me and um, I reacted.

Speaker 1:          01:58          Yeah, I think too that it's always nice to say your parents had the greatest influence.

Speaker 2:          02:05          I would say. In my case, my father had very little influence on my growing up. He was very busy. He had a small store which was not particularly successful. He was away all the time, six days a week at work. And the seventh day was the sabbath, a day of rest where his job was to get me up and drag me to the synagogue and sit next to him. While he went pray, pray. So the interaction wasn't particularly, uh, intimate or close. My mother was somewhat ambitious for me and she did defend me when I got into trouble and kind of showed me a little bit how you can stand up for rights. But I think my greatest impact came from teachers and peers. Um, particularly after I got out of the yeshiva system. I don't think the Jewish parochial school system had much of an impact on me.

Speaker 2:          02:52          I rebelled against it in that respect. It did have an impact. But when I got to Brooklyn College and Yale Law School, I was looking role models. Uh, I quickly learned there are no such thing and that every hero has clay feet and that everybody I respected, Oh, it was a flawed human being, but I was able to learn quite a bit, both intellectually and morally from some of my mentors, particularly the two, uh, judges I clerked for after I finished law school or Justice Arthur Goldberg of the United States Supreme Court and Judge David Basil on, they were both activists, left liberal, moderate left wing Jews, labor union activists, progressive's. And they showed me how I could live a Jewish life life in which I was not embarrassed about my heritage, where I could make the best of it and use the best from it and still contribute, uh, to America the world and not live in the Shtetl in the ghetto from which, uh, I grew up

Speaker 1:          03:54          and grew out would probably be

Speaker 2:          04:01          one summer in camp. I was, um, between my junior and senior year in high school, I was a terrible high school student. Uh, I got cs and b minuses. In fact, my yearbook originally said I was a good speaker. Some of your books had Dershowitz, he has a mouth of webster and ahead of clay. It was cute. And um, my, my rabbi said to me, look, Dershowitz, you know, you've got a good mouth on. You're not a very good brain. You've got to figure out a profession that you can use your mouth a lot and not your head. Uh, you should either be a lawyer or he said a conservative rabbi. He was, of course an Orthodox rabbi and that was the biggest put down you could, you could have. So I was put down a lot in high school and there was this one guy in camp who was four or five years older than me who was a counselor.

Speaker 2:          04:44          And he picked me to play the leading role in a play Cyrano de Bergerac by Edmund Rustin. Remember it as if it was today. It was not only my long knows that qualified me for the job, but I was not a bad, bad actor. And uh, and he was the first person, he sat me down one day and said, you know, you're smart, you have a very interesting mind, you see things differently, you're going to be a great student in college. I said, come on, I can't even get decent grades in a third rate, crummy high school. How am I going to do well in college? And he said, the better the school you go to, the better you'll do. And he was absolutely right. I went to Brooklyn College, I did very, very well. And then I went to Yale law school and I was first in my class. Yale law school was one of the elite institutions. He was so right that the more challenging the institution, the better I was going to do. And that was an insight that I just

Speaker 1:          05:35          didn't have. Day. I started this, there was never any other path.

Speaker 2:          05:43          Me, I was always a lawyer from the time I was five or six years old. My father, although an uneducated didn't finish high school, um, and it didn't read very much. Uh, uh, worker. Um, he liked to stand up for the underdog and he did convey that to me. And my family had a tradition of standing up for the underdog. My father's family helped rescue people from the Holocaust and social action and social commitment was part of my heritage in some respects. But I always thought I was going to be a lawyer and the only kind of a lawyer I ever thought of was a criminal or who. What else is there? I'm not working for the government. I wouldn't work for big government or big corporations. I had to be the lawyer for the underdog. So I don't think I ever made a decision to be a lawyer or a criminal lawyer. It was just something that I always thought I would do. Others thought I would do what was expected of me. It was a role I played since the time I was a child.
