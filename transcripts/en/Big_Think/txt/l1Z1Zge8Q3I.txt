Speaker 1:          00:07          Yes, we definitely will. I think they wouldn't be new collecting categories that we don't even exist yet at this moment or that haven't come to total fruition that are going to become more and more important. For instance, a old portable telephones or old computers, uh, all these objects that we take for granted that we use in our daily lives and that we changed nearly every four to six months. Uh, those will become collecting categories in their own right, or I, I mentioned earlier, Japanese toys and robots. They will become more and more valuable. There will be a limited editions by those artists who are great artists in their own right. And so these are markets that are going to develop and go. And so

Speaker 2:          00:54          it's this constantly evolving.
