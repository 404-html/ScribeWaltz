Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:08          I think that's true. Uh, I think, um, the supreme court has a lot of independent authority would just take this term, you know, it may be that the city council of Chicago, of New York of La wants to ban handguns in their city. Well, as of this year, too bad supreme court says you can't do it. You know that that is real power. In one, one of my favorite quotes about the supreme court comes from Robert Jackson who said, we are not justice Robert Jackson who said we are not final because we are infallible. We are infallible because we are final. Somebody has to have the last word and in our country it's the supreme court.

Speaker 1:          00:56          I don't think I have a judicial philosophy to speak of. I, I think I, I, I guess in my book, in my analysis, I am somewhat cynical, realistic, whatever you want to call it, about the political nature of judging when it comes to the constitution. When you are addressing questions like, does the constitution protect a woman's right to choose abortion? Does the constitution allow a, a university to consider race in admissions? I don't think those questions have right or wrong answers when it comes to interpreting the constitution. I think there are reasonable views on both sides as a legal matter. What I think is that there are political, the, that, that, it depends what you think in terms of your political philosophy. I think political philosophy means more than legal competence or expertise in deciding to big constitutional issues.

Speaker 2:          02:02          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:04          mine.

Speaker 2:          02:09          Well,

Speaker 1:          02:11          I mean, I, I think there are. I think there are terrific thinkers about the court. I like reading Cass Sunstein. I like reading Larry tribe. I like reading a Richard Posner. I liked reading a Ronald Dworkin. Um, but you know, this is not a moment where there are a lot of judges out there who are legal philosophers in the way that there have been in the past. There are people with distinctive philosophies that they apply in interesting and important ways, but I don't think there are a lot of geniuses in the way that there were. There were when there was homes and learn at hand.
