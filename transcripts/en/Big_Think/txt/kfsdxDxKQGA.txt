Speaker 1:          00:07          I'm not sure how much, uh, what I wish men knew about women that they don't,

Speaker 2:          00:13          I think it's, I think men can do a better job of really listening to women. I think a lot of times, you know, there's an old Chinese saying called Tang, um, I think I'm getting this right. And it means to listen with your heart, your ear and your mind. And I think sometimes when people listen, they, they don't listen with their full selves. You know, this is what emotional intelligence is all about. I think women give a lot of, you know, set something like 70% of communication is nonverbal. And that can be completely irrational to some people. Like, tell me exactly what you want to say. So I think if men would listen with their heads, heart, and mind altogether, I think they'd have better relationships with, you know, their, their partners, their mother's, whoever it is. But I also think that the world would be a much better place.
