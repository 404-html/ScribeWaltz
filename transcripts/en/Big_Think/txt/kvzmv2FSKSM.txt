Speaker 1:          00:10          Today it's, I'm trying to overcome American dominance in the world, are trying to overcome the American military, um, bullying that's taking place here and there in the world in Iraq and Afghanistan and, you know, military bases in 100 countries. And I think people are trying to work their way towards a more democratic society wherever possible and to do it without war. And, and I think this movement towards a more democratic society, society is more concerned with human rights. Oh, we've already seen it begin to happen in Latin America with movements from autocratic and elitist states to more populous states. And it may be that the European Union represents this in some way. And, uh, uh, it's a longterm process. But I think, you know, what is going on is an attempt to create a world which is different than the world of the past hundred years, which was a world of an incessant war and domination of the world by superpowers. First two superpowers. And now one superpower.
