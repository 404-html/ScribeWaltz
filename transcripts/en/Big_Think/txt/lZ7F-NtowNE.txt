Speaker 1:          00:06          I was closeted for most of my life, my adult life. I wanted to be an actor, which alone just that alone was, um, some people thought a crazy aspiration to have because I am Asian and Asians, uh, first of all, our adult have many opportunities to get cast. Plus the fact that, um, uh, there were stereotypes that we were saddled with either the cold, heartless, a killer, uh, the, uh, inscrutable a person that's got something always going on in the back of his mind leading to suspicion that a where we could be spies or the survival, the quiet obsequious or the buffoon, all very unattractive stereotypes. So why I would go into acting, but something that, well, I'm the black sheep of the family. My parents thought it was absolutely crazy, but they knew how passionate I was. And to get cast with first, uh, this uh, uh, ethnic, uh, barrier, a hurdle for me to cross A. I didn't want to add another one of being gay gay people.

Speaker 1:          01:32          We're not a cast or if they were exposed as gay, their career is faded. I remember when I was a teenager, there was a very good looking, handsome actor named Tab Hunter who was a contract active with warner brothers and almost every other movie coming from Warner Brothers start tab hunter. He was the heartthrob of America until confidential, exposed him as being gay and eventually he disappeared. That was an object lesson for me and so I was closeted and my career was making progress and so I did everything to protect my career, which meant having my guard up all the time. Being careful about the pronouns I used, a denying some, a good portion of who I was. It was a very uncomfortable, a way to live, except when you're doing it, it becomes a part of your normal existence. I lived that uncomfortable existence as what I thought was going to be my life.

Speaker 1:          02:52          You know, I used to go to gay bars in Los Angeles back then and, uh, it was a wonderful place. That guard can come down. I could make friends as who I am, and to really relax and enjoy friendship, camaraderie, and a, a wonderful evening or an afternoon. But one of the older people told me that periodically the police would raid gay bars and they would march the clients out, put them on a patty wagon, drive them to the police station, fingerprint them, photograph them, and their names were, would be put on a list. It was terrifying. Their lives can be destroyed. They could lose their jobs, perhaps their families. It was a horrible thing. And what were they doing? A criminal activity according to the law at that time being gay was criminalized. We were marched out, put into paddy wagons and registered. And I thought, that's no different.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Different than what happened to me when I was child because of this face, because we look like the people that bombed Pearl Harbor. We were put into prison camps, guarded over by, uh, soldiers with machine guns pointed down that is from century towers. It was the same thing. And I thought that was horrible, was wrong, unjust. And yet that was the way we had to live those few isolated moments when we could be ourselves. And then stonewall happened. When the people they're resistant, they decided they had enough. They're not going to take it anymore, and that was the galvanizing event and society began to change, and by the 21st century, uh, things were really starting to change. Massachusetts, the State Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled that marriage equality was constitutional. So that was the first state. Two years later on the other coast in California, the People's representatives this time, through the legislative route, both houses of the California legislature, the assembly and the Senate, passed the marriage equality bill. All that, that bill needed was a signature of the governor to become the law of the state. It would have been two states book ending America with marriage equality. The governor at that time happened to be a movie star, Arnold Schwartzenegger. When he campaigned for that office, he told the public, I'm from Hollywood. I've worked with gays and lesbians. Some of my best friends are gays and lesbians, and persuaded by that, a couple of my gay friends did vote for him.

Speaker 1:          06:12          Yet when that bill landed on his desk, he acted as the representative of this base, the right wing of the Republican Party. And he vetoed it. I was raging, but I had trained my body muscular, holding that rage and that night brad and I were watching the late night news and I saw all these young people pouring out on the Santa Monica Boulevard, venting their rage on our no Schwartzenegger and we felt the same way and it got us to thinking and talking and Brad and I discussed it. I was 68 years old by that time and I thought, well, I want my life to have some meeting. I want the time that I have left to do something about that aspect of who we are. And so I spoke to the press for the first time as a gay man and I blasted Arnold Schwarzenegger's veto and what I thought of my career, I thought it was going to go on the downhill side. The opposite happened. It just lost and I've been working more since coming out then I had been when I was closeted.
