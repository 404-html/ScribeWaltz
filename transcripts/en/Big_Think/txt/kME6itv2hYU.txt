Speaker 1:          00:11          That is a contradiction between economic growth and the public space. First of all, I think the most crucial competitive factor in our time is he's not like the car, the cruiser competitive factor in our time. It's not like he was in the past land or even capital, but people how to attract and retain the best qualified people. So I would say the most crucial competitive issue in our time is quality of life. A public space is crucial for quality of life. Public pedestrian space,

Speaker 2:          00:55          Eh,

Speaker 1:          00:58          gives us quality. It needs to retain great people at. But also it's very important for the people who live there themselves for the poor. I believe that there is no contradiction whatsoever in trying to have investments in great public pedestrian space, but gratefully space, however different from most things governments do is not just a means. Most things governments do are a means to economic development. Governments invents the roads in tunnels, in irrigation districts, in ports, in airports,

Speaker 2:          01:37          uh,

Speaker 1:          01:38          because it's necessarily for the country to, to produce material,

Speaker 2:          01:44          eh,

Speaker 1:          01:46          goods and services, but, but, but they are a means to an end. The end. What is the end? The end is happiness in the case of politic. Pedestrian space is a very peculiar good because it's an end in itself. I mean it just to have great public space makes people happier and creates more social integration. Again, I believe it also creates economic development because actually, for example, if I asked some people to go live in some, some cities in the third world have serious problems like Lego's in Nigeria. If people want to get

Speaker 2:          02:31          eh,

Speaker 1:          02:34          some, a person to go live in lake or some, uh, some expert engineer in something, they will have to pay him very, very much to compensate for the hardships of being in Legos if they had. Instead, when people go to Paris, it happens. The opposite. People are willing to take a reduction in their material will be in, they go to a, they may go without a car, they go with a much smaller apartment because the city gave them so much back. So actually to invest in a good city is good business is not robots and making investment decisions.

Speaker 2:          03:16          And, uh,

Speaker 1:          03:18          we need to make us eat that is attractive to the people we most want to have an sat at adults who could actually go anywhere in the world they want because they are such good technicians or an artist or a professionals or whatever they do that they could choose to go wherever they want. And if we don't have a great city,

Speaker 3:          03:45          they will.
