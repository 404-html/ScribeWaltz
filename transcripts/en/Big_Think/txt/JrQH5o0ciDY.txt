Speaker 1:          00:07          We ran into a tragedy, however, when I was four, my one year old sister died suddenly from croup form of pneumonia, I guess, and she was my mother's attempt to be born again, you might say through her daughter because he's great. Wives, lived very tough lives giving how their husbands were working and when she lost her beloved daughter, she went into very deep mourning. And I, uh, as a child who normally thinks we, I think we think of ourselves as the center of the solar system. Everything revolves around us. We're responsible for everything. I guess I wondered why as my mother withdrew and to the deepest, deepest depression psychologically what I did to cause her to abandon me, added to my complexities, I guess you'd say I formed a, a, a pattern of having to achieve and having to be perfect so I could somehow regained her, uh, her affection and her attention and that's had some good points and had some bad points because trying to achieve perfection can be a productive. It can also be a very destructive process after awhile. So she had quite an impact on me.
