Speaker 1:          00:04          I grew up in the fringes of the oil business in Tulsa, Tulsa called itself the oil capital of the world in the 19 fifties and it wasn't real far off. It was very central to a lot of oil companies, oil equipment, and the rest and most people in business, a very large share of them were in the oil business in one way or another. Well, so anybody who's familiar with the oil business knows that up until the early 20th century you could only get gasoline from a tiny share of petroleum, but first with thermal cracking and then in the thirties catalytic cracking, you could use much larger share, 70, 80 percent maybe of oil to produce gasoline. And it was that expansion of the feedstock that made possible the Transportation Revolution of the early 20th century. As a reason, gasoline was twenty five cents a gallon when I was growing up in Tulsa.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Detroit doesn't produce the oil and the United States produces some oil certainly, and we're going to need oil for a long time, but if we can get to a lot less oil than we have now, we can do something very important. I'll give you one example. Any corn of the Igs, a think tank in in Washington that promotes working on energy for national security purposes says that um, up until the late 19th, early 20th century salt was a strategic commodity. There was no other way to preserve meat. Preserving meat was hugely important for the human diet, huge share of the human food chain. So people who had salt mines and countries that had salt mines were really important. Believe it or not, countries fought wars over salt.

Speaker 1:          01:53          That changed with refrigeration. Now we still use salt. Probably we still use it some to preserve meat, but mainly we use it for flavoring and one thing or another, unless you are intimately familiar with Morton's, you probably don't have any idea where it comes from. You don't care. It's bought and sold on a market. It's a commodity like a lot of other commodities, but nobody is going to order you around because he's got salt and you don't, well, we need to do that oil, we need to destroy, not oil, but we need to destroy it as a strategic commodity so we don't need it for transportation. There are real competitors and the competitors, electricity, alternative fuels together in one. Some combination, um, can get the job done at that point. Oil becomes like lots of other commodities and by the way, it becomes much more operative in a free market because what you have now is not a free market.

Speaker 1:          02:56          OPEC runs at a cartel and they are able run it with Saudi Arabia leading it a because it's a strategic commodity and there was no other way for most people and most structures in the world to propel their vehicles around except with, with the oil, petroleum derived fuels. If we can end that. So there are some competitors that are close to oils cost like cellulosic ethanol and others like, um, electricity. There are much cheaper. People are still gonna want oil. Depends on how cheap it is. Whether they use oil or natural gas in the chemical plant, etc. Fine. Don't want to destroy oil. Want to do to it. What reFrigeration did assault.
