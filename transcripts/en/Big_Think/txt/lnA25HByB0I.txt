Speaker 1:          00:10          This same sky trend. Technologies for linear synchronis motors and the maglev, uh, are being applied to a wind technologies. What we're doing with our partner, one cycle control and power conversion. There's a couple aspects of this. We are number one, we're building a unit here in Irvine to go up in palm springs to replace a 1980s Norwegian, a 58 foot diameter, windmill, 65 kilowatts. This should be going up in a couple of weeks and we'll have to test it for a couple months and then there's going to be several hundred if they liked the data they see. In other words, we do all this math and physics, but now you've got to build stuff and prove it. So that's what we're doing. So this technology, we will eliminate the gearboxes where you have a direct drive system. 40% of the lifetime costs of windmills is the gearboxes they wear out. The same reason on skytrain, you don't want gearboxes and tires, things wear out.

Speaker 1:          01:16          The other aspect is the power conversion. We can take low, low speeds and high high speeds and supply to the utility. Southern California Edison. In this instance, proper frequency electric and was, if all your s frequency is 60 cycle, maybe they can accept between 50 and 70 while if they're great, greatest mean, pulled down to say 59.3 cycles a second, guess what? We're going to deliver 59.3 and this is the one cycle control power technology. What this enables is we can gather energy at very low speeds and higher speeds up to the limitations where you have a good structural safety factor on the props. We sidebuy sea side the geared type system compared to our system. In a year, we should be able to sell about double the energy to southern California Anderson on the same wind profile on the same hill. This is going to be pretty hot. We're getting a lot of interest in financial interest in this technology and it really actually gets better when we started talking three or five megawatt wind mills, the big ones, and there's even 10 megawatt wind mills up, uh, being designed not to.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Yeah.
