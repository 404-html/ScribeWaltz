Speaker 1:          00:13          Every every local car company in China is working on hybrids. I'm in fact going back to a point, you know Toyota makes it Prius, hybrid now in China, 260,000 RMB. Chung on a local car company makes a hybrid, so 160,000 RMB, not as good as that Prius. I guarantee you 100,000 RMB. Cheaper. Every single local car company and local car companies account for 30 percent now the passenger car business agenda, the truck and bus business almost completely local. Okay. There's no foreign company that has a meaningful participation in that commercial vehicle industry, so there are a lot of local passenger car companies, trucking companies and so forth. These lending companies that are all thinking about the environment, everybody's working on programs to improve the fuel efficiency and the environmental impact. I think that the whole thinking about the environment in China's mind switched seven years ago when they announced that Beijing would get the 2008 Olympics.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Think at that point, every official in China realized that in 2008 for the first time, millions of people coming to China and they didn't want the environment to be the big issue, so there's a long way to go and believe me, China's got a huge environmental issue, but the first step begins with thinking differently about your. I think that's already happened and so everybody's conscious about it, they're working on it. A guarantee. I think a lot of the new innovations in, for example, in the auto industry, are going to come out of China. Why? Because there's no single country in the world as a bigger vested interest in getting that done. Then China, China needs to grow to lift up those neither 1 million people to grow. It needs more transportation. If the more transportation, the more pollution. If it can't make available that transportation, if that's a constraint on growth. So for China, it's a matter of economic life and death to find better ways to do it and that's what I think is going to happen over the next 10 years.
