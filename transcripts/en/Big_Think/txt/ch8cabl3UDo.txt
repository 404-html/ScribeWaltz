Speaker 1:          00:11          I think that the people who have been doing political satire or the people I've talked to have really felt like it used to be the, again, the media was the watchdog for um, those, you know, the government and corporate America and when the media sort of felt like it was in bed and they were lazy or in bed with, with their, you know, advertisers. Um, I think comics naturally started filling the role of sort of being the watchdog of the watchdog, you know, pill, political satire and comedy. We just started asking the questions that journalists weren't asking anymore, uh, through humor, through sort of hopefully funny, righteous sanger, um, but also just asking questions that our audience wanted to hear. And so we were doing basically a service we just kept doing, we were doing, but then it just transitioned into like, find out what's going on or if we're just going to be lied to from right left and center to provide a haven where at least people can come together and not feel crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:19          I feel like, Hey, I'm in a group of people who have understand that everybody's spinning us and somebody onstage pointing that out through humor. At least I can breathe a sigh that I'm not insane. When I hear the cacophony of lies, I think comedy can be a tool for social activism. I think that when you point out hypocrisy again, because the media often doesn't, you know, the, the, the followup question should just be put in the Smithsonian as a relic of media because there are no follow ups anymore. People don't have enough historical knowledge to say, wait, you're lying if you don't have enough knowledge on the environment to say, uh, wait. Scientists say there's global warming, it's real. So a lot of information just sort of floats out there like, like a thick muggy day and nobody weeds through it and cuts through the muck and says, here's the truth.

Speaker 1:          02:15          And I think that pointing that out through humor can be a tool to have people say, wow, um, I should be asking questions and I'm laughing. Uh, and I think that's what's fun, is that you can ask questions yourself on stage through humor, and then that means the audience kind of scratches a tent and says, you're right. And as you watch, uh, videos on the web and the daily show, Colbert, Bill Maher, you will see them lay out a case and make it funny through video, through things that are out there. Somebody says one thing one day and something else the next day. And, um, you know, we have this amazing medium with which we can put it out, right?
