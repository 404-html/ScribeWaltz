Speaker 1:          00:06          I have a chapter on reasonable doubt and it's about, of course the phrase reasonable doubt covers up in courts of law where juries are told that they must convict somebody of murder only if there is, it's beyond reasonable doubt that they are guilty. And that sounds all very good. It should be beyond reasonable doubt. But when you think about the fact that I think about courtroom dramas which are so popular on television for example, and I suspect that this accurately portray something like what goes on in real courtrooms. And I've certainly been on three juries myself. There is a note of suspense in the court when the jury comes back, which way will it go? Will it be guilty or not guilty? And then if they say not guilty, um, certain people have a great sign of relief if they say guilty, other people do.

Speaker 1:          00:59          So there is a lot of doubt in the courtroom among people who've sat through the entire trial. The judge, for example, the lawyers, the audience sat through the entire trial as the jewelry has. So if the jury comes in and brings in a verdict that is beyond reasonable doubt, everybody in the code should know that. If it's beyond reasonable doubt, there can be no doubt of which way the jewelry we'll, uh, we'll jump. And yet when the jewelry do give their verdict, because how can that be if it's beyond reasonable doubt? Imagine the following experiment. Suppose that you had two juries listening to the same evidence and the two juries not allowed to talk to each other. They are sent off into separate jury rooms and they come up with their own separate verdicts. Who would bet on the jury's coming back with the same verdict every single time. But actually nobody would in my, if you think about the Oj Simpson trial or for example, any 40, based on another jury coming up with the same verdict, um, and yet, unless you can bet, unless you can say yes, they would come up with the same verdict. You cannot really take the phrase beyond reasonable doubt. Seriously. Now, I'm not suggesting that we should have two juries in every trial. I'm just pointing out that the phrase beyond reasonable doubt, it doesn't actually mean what it says.
