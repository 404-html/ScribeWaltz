Speaker 1:          00:11          I guess the most commendable thing he's done is, uh, not decide the bomb he ran or something. Like, I think I'm things he hasn't done that it's commendable that he hasn't done them, but, uh, he can point to very little, at least by my standards, just commendable. I mean, he's retracted some of the more extreme, uh, Bush positions. So for example, say on Cuba, uh, Bush imposed condition, the normal conditions are totally outlandish and ridiculous, which is why everyone except Israel votes against them at the UN and why the majority of Americans subject to them. But the Bush went way beyond the and post even harsher conditions and uh, uh, Obama with through some of those, uh, on, uh, nuclear issues, he has indicated that the u s should return to the main stream of international affairs, assign. They consider again the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty move towards reducing nuclear weapons. Okay. That's a step forward from bushes position, but it's a step towards the center and towards the international main stream and also towards the American public opinion. Uh, and there's a number of other cases like that where the, the Bush administration, especially its first term was quite extreme, which is why a, the u s standing in the world fell to historic lows.

Speaker 1:          01:50          Nothing much because I never expected anything. Um, I th I was a little surprised by the fact that he re-instituted uh, some of the, uh, uh, the, uh, judicial practices that were kind of unconscionable that Bush, uh, uh, uh, made use of, like, he wants preventative detention permanently. Uh, uh, he's been waffling about torture. He's refusing to grant a normal criminal trials to people that they have no evidence against a, they claim to have none. Uh, things like that have been a little surprising. I don't think he had to be that extreme. And, uh, uh, in his, uh, interpretation of actually deviation from any reasonable legal stuff.
