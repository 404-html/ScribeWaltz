Speaker 1:          00:05          Well, what Star Wars does is it tells us about parents and children and uh, how connected each is to the other. And it is probably the most stirring tale I think of a boy's need for a dad and a dad's need for a boy that we have in modern culture. And it kind of nail some of the intensity of those feelings. It also, and I think this is equally deep, uh, tells us something about redemption. So the idea is that, uh, if you can get your kid to love you, uh, it's probably going to be okay. And also if you do something heroic and good, uh, you can probably be redeemed in some sense of your soul, whether we're talking about religion or nod. You can be redeemed even if you were, uh, really a creep before that, at least if what you do, they redeemed yourself is very major and important as it certainly wasn't star wars.

Speaker 1:          00:59          I think we're going to see themes about parents and kids and redemption in the, uh, in the new episodes as well in terms of empires and, um, republics. Um, what the movie's kind of capture. And I think nail is that authoritarianism, uh, has a bit of an appeal. The idea that, you know, an authoritarian leader can get something done, then maybe take a little bit of the chaos, the freedom creates and uh, get it into some sort of manage management and that can make life a little more orderly and people like that. But it also tells us that in every human heart there is a kind of a need for freedom, meaning there isn't going to be a boot on your face and there's going to be a capacity for governor yourself and the tail of the appeal of authoritarianism, which really kind of captures what happened in Nazi Germany and captured a little bit some of the appeal of authoritarians all over the world, including, uh, currently a Turkey.

Speaker 1:          02:06          And it gets that. And it gets that in a way that is true to the arc of human history and the failures of authoritarianism because of, um, people don't like him food in their face, it kind of lightly, but, um, uh, but memorably captures that as well. So if you're in a, you know, a country that's poor and where people's property rights aren't secure, or are you go on the streets and someone might beat you up. Or if you're in a country that's doing pretty well, like the United States and some European nations, but terrorism is a risk, or if terrorism is unlikely, uh, still, uh, you might get something stolen or somebody might knock out because there's violent crime or even if it doesn't happen to you, if you read it about the newspaper, then you might think, uh, law and order is a pretty good, uh, corrective.

Speaker 1:          03:05          And even if law and order means that civil liberties and civil rights will be reduced, maybe that's a trade you will be willing to take. And we certainly saw that in the United States at times over the past, let's say 40 years. And while in the United States, in my view, nothing really horrific has happened in terms of the rise of authoritarianism. The fact that there have been movements away from civil rights and civil liberties is suggestive of something that's possible when people feel really at risk. So what Star Wars captures, and this makes it transcend the kind of simple dichotomy between the light side and the dark side of the force is it says that, you know, uh, the dark side, it does have a seductive power either because it means that each of us can wield power if we go dark or because it means that, uh, somebody at least is going to be controlled in control of human impulses, uh, that can, um, uh, threatened us. And if the controlling power is reflecting those forces, that's not so good. But, uh, some people would rather live in an orderly society that is not a day to day, let's say, a unraveling than a society that is free because freedom, uh, suggest the possibility at least of a little unraveling.
