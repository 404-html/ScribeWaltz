Speaker 1:          00:08          As part of big think mentor, which is, um, big things, lifelong learning channel on Youtube. I'm Jason Gods and we're very, very happy today to be joined by Maria Konnikova, author of mastermind, how to think like Sherlock Holmes in her workshop on big think mentor. She teaches thinking skills from the masters sleuth including observation deduction and imaginative problem solving among others. And we're here as a followup to that workshop with Sin Burgess who's a member of big think, mentors, learning community. Uh, welcome Maria. We're delighted that you're here.

Speaker 2:          00:43          Thank you so much for having me. I'm excited for this. I've never done a google plus hanging out before,

Speaker 1:          00:49          so, um, and this is our first ever, so bear with us if there's background noise or any other technical interruptions or you know, suddenly the Google plus animation of a mustache or you're on one of us. Um, so I think what we'll do, we'll start with, you know, essentially this is a follow on to Maria's workshop on mentor, which is called how to think like a Sherlock Holmes. You can get there by going to youtube.com/user/big thing mentor. And we're asking followup questions. Um, I have some questions. We've got other questions from members of mentors community and we'll start with, um, sid, uh, and said if you'd like to introduce yourself would say a couple of words about what brought you to mentor or what, you know, what, what you're, what you're up to. Um, and then, uh, and then go ahead and ask Maria your questions. Yeah, I saw just, I think

Speaker 3:          01:45          Sid Burgess, I think I'm just kind of addicted to the notion of trying to, um, hone a personal skills to try to, you know, improve your life and day to day, uh, just I enjoy the topic in general. So I've been a big fan of, uh, of the channel and even before you guys, uh, uh, went to a big thing for mentors. I'm really kind of excited to be a part of this. Um, yeah, I had a question just to kind of kick things off. I really was curious, uh, what, uh, some of the mentors was wanting to get out of this whole experience themselves. Uh, we, we sort of are used to kind of receiving this feedback or receiving this, these good ideas, but part of a, part of the, uh, part of the brilliance of this whole kind of community is, is that everybody's kind of is getting something out of it too as well. So I was just kind of curious from your what, what are you looking to get out of a big thing to mentor?

Speaker 2:          02:35          Well, I'm looking to get out of it. That's a wonderful question. Questions just like the one that you asked. So when you really have, um, people who interact with you and who ask new questions, you've look at things in a different way and it makes you think about topics that you wouldn't think about otherwise, which I think is really important. So when I, whenever I answer questions from readers, whenever I give talks, answer questions from the audience, there's, you know, there are always questions that repeat, but there's always something new. And I say, Huh, that's really interesting. And then I start thinking about it and it lets me develop my ideas. It's kind of like the Holmes Watson relationship actually to, uh, kind of bring it back to that. I think that Watson really improves Holmes's thinking and Holmes becomes much better throughout the stories. The more he interacts with Watson because Watson asks provocative questions, he always forces homes to stop and think why he's doing what he's doing. And that kind of back and forth is incredibly important, um, to keep your thinking sharp, to keep yourself stimulated. I don't think that anyone should ever really work in a bathroom even though writing is often a very solitary profession. But that interaction I think is incredibly important.

Speaker 3:          03:55          Jason, you want me ask my second question? Absolutely. Alright, so the second one, uh, is, uh, it's one of the, I've actually had a kind of mulling around in my mind for a while as this notion of, of being too distracted and multitasking and you brought it up in one of your video. So I really wanted to ask you this specifically. I enjoy going. That's my favorite place in the world. It really doesn't matter which one it is, is the coffee shop. I just enjoy sitting in the coffee shop and just kind of watching the world go by and people watching as we like to say, but almost more than that too. I just enjoy kind of just a, almost in a sense of meditation, just taking in all the sights and sounds of whatever city that I'm in and trying to process them almost simultaneously. So I wanted to just ask you how, how would you, how would you describe maybe in a way that would help help improve that, uh, that mental, uh, exercise and the way that differentiates that from kind of the multitasking or the endorphin driven kind of electronic distraction? Um, uh, that we hear a lot about. Can you kind of, you can maybe differentiate the two a little bit and maybe how we can focus it on, on the better one?

Speaker 2:          05:02          Sure. So what you like to do is definitely not multitasking. Um, that's kind of unitasking at its best because you're doing something very specific. You're kind of watching or letting your senses take everything in. So I think the, the myth about multitasking, you, you can't be looking at multiple things at once and have that not be multitasking. You can't be doing multiple activities at once. So their brain can't be thinking, okay, I want to do this, but also I want to do this. Oh, I'm watching these people. But also I'm focused on what I'm going to order at the coffee shop, when I'm going to have for lunch, what I'm going to do after I leave the coffee shop, what else I have planned for this city. If you were thinking all of these things at the same time and then you'd be multitasking, but if you're kind of in the moment and just soaking everything in using all of your senses, that's really sensory taking in the, in a very mindful fashion.

Speaker 2:          05:59          Um, which is the purpose of, uh, of mindfulness. So I think those are two very, very different experiences. And in order to really, I think do get a lot of out of what you do and get more out of that type of people watching, which by the way, I think is really interesting and fascinating. And helps you develop as a, as a person and develop your thinking and develop your powers of observation is really realize that that's exactly what you're doing and do your best to avoid distracting thoughts. So if you see someone and that puts your mind along the lines of, oh, hey, that person reminds me of my friend x and settling, you're thinking about fed x in your mind is going on a tangent, realize that that's happening. Stop yourself and come back to just observing and taking everything in. I think that's how you can make the most out of that experience.

Speaker 1:          06:53          Okay, great. Um, I have other questions from other mentor members who would have liked to have been with us today but could not for technical reasons. So, um, we've got Matthew J. Clark is asking what are the current theories about why tasks switching causes fatigue? And that's, that's how he worded the question. And unfortunately, folks aren't here to do follow up, but

Speaker 2:          07:21          of course, so we know that attention is an incredibly finite resource. So there's really only so much of it to go around and we can train our intention so that we become better, but we'll never be able to make it incident. And so one of the things that tasks which in does is use that mental energy. So you need resources to switch your focus from one thing to another. And the theory is actually is very simple. The more your mind is doing, the more resources it needs. And so every time you switch your attention who are actually switching circuits, you're switching your focus, you're switching kind of the neural mechanisms behind it and that expense energy, literally you can replenish it by having glucose or other, um, other things that actually boosts your energy levels. So it's a very, very literal thing that happens. Your brain is actually getting tired, you're actually using resources and you're actually becoming less able to do other things because you use those resources for the task switching. Now you no longer have them to pay attention to the tasks that you're doing. There's a lot of really interesting work that shows that people who multitask frequently are less efficient at task switching because they're always the, they don't know how to take those resources and really use them to their full potential, which I think is really fascinating because it ends up that heavy multitaskers become worse at the very thing that they should be very good at.

Speaker 1:          08:52          Right, right. I've, I've read some of that research and it's fascinating because, you know, the, the sort of plugged in millennial folks who you would think would be the best step at this actually the more they multitask, it seems the worst.

Speaker 2:          09:06          Yup. They become a worse that being able to filter out distractions. Um, and that's a good thing if you want to make sure that you're paying attention to everything, but you also get off task very, very frequently in very easily, which is not a good thing. So not being able to filter out distractions can make them worse at task switching to the tasks you actually want to be switching to, if that makes sense. Yeah. Something I'd be like, oh, Hey, there was this distraction. Maybe I'll do that instead.

Speaker 1:          09:37          So in this regard, do you think that sort of, we're all doomed given the, you know, tech, technological, uh, the sort of multitasking world that folks are growing up in now? Or are there things people can do, you know, to, uh, to counteract that? I mean, you know, there's concerns about people being addicted.

Speaker 2:          09:55          Sure. No, I don't think we're all doing that all. Um, I think that technology is wonderful and that we just need to be aware of how much you will call it exerts on us and how difficult that can be to avoid. So what I would say is we need to learn to train our attention. Um, because as with anything, attention is like a muscle. It's an analogy that you hear all over and over until they college is self control. Like a muscle, you know, everything. Basically you can say, hey, it's like a muscle because it's an analogy that works incredibly well. So if you train it, it gets stronger, it gets better. You are able to know why ticking. You have more endurance. And similarly with attention, the more you train yourself to the task and to only pay attention to one thing at a time, the longer and longer and longer you're able to maintain your focus.

Speaker 2:          10:47          So what's happening when people say that they cannot pay attention is that they haven't trained their attention. They've forgotten what it is to have a single minded focus. And because they haven't trained it, their attention actually has gotten worse. So I think that people know when they say they cannot pay attention, they really can't. It doesn't just happen over night. Um, and so what we can do is try to monitor ourselves and really learn to do one thing at a time. For me that's, um, there's been a lot that I've had to do to actually maximize my own potential. When I was writing mastermind, I realized how Internet addicted I was and I actually needed to install, um, freedom, which is an internet blocking software on my computer so that I wouldn't go online. And it was really hard for me. But eventually I was able to stay off mine for four or five hours at a time.

Speaker 2:          11:43          Um, and I turned my phone off because otherwise it'd be too tempted to, uh, check my internet on the iphone because unfortunately, freedom doesn't it get blocked all of your devices and now I don't really need it as often because I, I know I do it and I've already trained myself not to. It's still nice once in a while. I think we all need to give ourselves mental breaks and realize that the Internet is your fault, but sometimes it's good to just focus and not let those email notifications, those twitter notification. Yeah. All of those things that can just sucker attention. No, not, not them interfere.

Speaker 1:          12:23          Gotcha. And speaking of attention for our viewers, the noise that sounds like the ocean is a most likely some, you know, Maria lives in a fairly noisy neighborhood. Nothing we can really do about that. So that's what that is. Um, okay. Let me continue with people's questions because I could, I could do followups here all day. Um, Matthew also asks, how can you habituate an input from one sense so that it does not interfere with the attention you give to another sense. For example, reading body language while having a conversation?

Speaker 2:          13:02          Well, I think that there are actually two different issues here. Um, habituation. Yeah. Is it very specific term when it comes to psychology and you don't do it, it just happens. It's something that's incredibly, incredibly natural. So as soon as it, as there's a stimulus that you're hearing, often you'd be, you do become habituated to it. Um, so for instance, one of my favorite examples comes from my personal experience. Um, my freshman year of college, I had a huge church right outside my windows and the bells would ring and I'm weekends. It bells would ring. And I was a college freshman. I wanted to sleep. Um, and at first they always wake me up and I got to the point where I didn't even hear them. I didn't realize that was for, um, we're ringing. And it's not that I made a conscious effort to habituate your brain learns to lock out the noises that if serious all the time and the same can be true of vision.

Speaker 2:          13:59          So that's why you often, you know, if we tell us, if you asked me, no, what do I pass on my waist work every day, I might not be able to answer think, oh, I know exactly what I pass, but because I do it every day, I don't pay attention to it because I've become habituated to all those sites and I may not, it may not even notice that a store has closed or in the store has opened in its stead unless something draws my attention to it and I'm out of my situated, um, state. So it just happens. And what region do is actually not habituated ourselves and try to is we don't want to, the active part is not habituation but with standing habituation, if that makes sense. Gotcha. Okay.

Speaker 1:          14:45          Okay. Um, so one other question from another mentor member, John. Francoise, Noel, um, asks Watson is really helpful to homes. Do you have tools or ideas for, you know, solutions to create our own imaginary watson or other ways to get a similar benefit without having a watson if you don't have one?

Speaker 2:          15:11          Yeah, that's uh, it's interesting and I'd stopped short of saying have imaginary people conversations in your heads just because that you could take that a little bit too far, but you can learn to kind of argue with yourself and to always, um, that's actually how I get a lot of my thinking done. You know, I say, okay, this is what I think, what, what, what's the counter argument to that? Or why do I think that way? So force yourself almost to be in a debate or mindset always. It doesn't just make you more critical of yourself and make some critical all of the information that you're taking in of everything that you're reading is everything that you are watching of all of the constant news and other inputs that you get every day isn't just don't take it in as candid as you give him and say, oh, that makes sense.

Speaker 2:          16:00          Rather always play devil's advocate. Say, wait, that doesn't make sense because we're not in a, in a large way. That's exactly what Watson does. And the other good thing to do is get yourself a watson and the sense of get yourself someone you know with whom you can discuss things, someone who listens to you. Um, it's really good to talk things through. And I think you often find that when you see gaps in logic, when you say something out loud, that'd be store. Um, you never really voiced. And so one of the ways it can do that is, is you think that you know what you're doing. Actually pretend that we need to explain it to someone else and explain it out loud or you can even write it out. So writing is, it was a good exercise. Do what you can say he did.

Speaker 2:          16:45          I really understand this because writing shows gaps in logic very, very strongly. So if I write something and I'm like, wait, that little bit of sense in my head, but on the page, it's settling. Doesn't make sense. I have to try to figure out why that's the case and anyone to do that. Um, do you don't need anyone else. You don't want to talk to yourself. You don't need to imagine conversations, all you have to do is write out your argument as if you were explaining it to someone else or write out their thinking is a few words to someone else.

Speaker 1:          17:16          That's interesting. Yeah. That's why it can be helpful to keep it a journal. I know that I've experienced that in writing a journal that you, you start writing, you know your thoughts about things and you're surprised to like, uh, your perspective on them is completely different from what you might have thought it was in your head. So, um, so I have a couple of questions of my own. Um, and maybe in the interest of time I'll ask just one of them and then see if it has a follow up. Um, and uh, and we'll, we'll, we'll, we'll close out. I'm looking over here at another computer. That's why I'm not looking at everyone. Um, many of the points you multitasking. Yes, I am.

Speaker 2:          18:00          It's he media multitasking. Um,

Speaker 1:          18:03          very well. Um, many of the points you make in the workshop add up to the fact that we can't trust our own common sense. That, and, and in your book of course mastermind, um, our minds make up stories. They're biased to pay attention to some things and ignore others. Uh, and in order to solve problems more effectively, we need to examine our assumption assumption's rigorously and consider the data in ways that don't necessarily come naturally to us. Um, which is very counterintuitive in some ways to at least, uh, the culture I grew up in American culture of, you know, trust yourself, you know, and trust with sort of your common sense in a sense. Um, not only is this practically hard as we're biased to trust ourselves, it might also be emotionally hard in that many of us construct our identities and sense of self worth, security, et Cetera, around self trust, around trust in our own sort of common sense. What are your thoughts about how to manage, like if somebody is training themselves to be more skeptical and more critical of their own thinking, how to manage that transition emotionally and otherwise?

Speaker 2:          19:13          I think that's a really interesting question and I think that the way, the way that I view it is it's not, don't trust yourself. It's don't trust yourself when you have no reason to do so when you have no experience in something. So experts can trust all of their instincts and their common sense in their areas of expertise. And the problem comes when non-experts have a book common sense opinion that really is just coming out of nowhere. And we do that all the time. There are areas where we're expert, um, but then we do the exact same thing in areas where we're not really experts. So if you think for instance, I see this person and he's acting shifted to me, my common sense as he's doing something wrong, oh you shouldn't distress that. That common sense because you're an expert in looking at people and in reading body language, you've done that your entire life.

Speaker 2:          20:06          So something as simple as that who actually aren't an expert in you should listen to yourself even if you're not really sure why you think something might be picking up on cues, the triggers. Ask Yourself, why do I think this person's acting suspicious? Am I actually reading body language or am I using non expertise? Am I putting someone else in my putting someone else in this situation and this person just reminds me of someone I don't like. So now I think they're shifting. So you have to, it's not about not trusting yourself per se. It's about examining the reasons for your assumptions and always saying, okay, am I actually making this judgment based on some sort of expertise or am I like one of those people who makes a decision about whether or not I'm going to hire someone in the first 30 seconds of an interview just because I liked them or didn't like them? Um, in which case there's no expertise there. You, you don't know anything about the person. Um, so I think it depends on the judgment and it depends on what you're using to get there, if that makes sense. It makes sense.

Speaker 1:          21:16          Okay. So I think, yeah, I'll ask one more question and then we'll, and then we'll turn it over to said, this is about, uh, the value of creativity and imagination. How well two psychologists at this point understand creativity. I imagine it's not something, it's not a subject that gets, you know, heavy research dollars thrown at it. Um, uh, have their insights yet yielded anything that you would think of as a sort of practical, useful approach to teaching or enhancing people's creativity, um, beyond letting your mind do its thing, you know, daydreaming, etc.

Speaker 2:          21:58          Yeah. I think what we're starting to understand creativity, but it's a really, really hard thing to study because there are many different types of creativity. There are many manifestations of creativity. It's not like an overarching entity. You are or you are not creative. You're creative in different ways. And there are different ways of having creative insights. Um, so psychologists are a little bit limited in that they have to study things in a laboratory and so they have to have an artificial paradigm. And so they try to figure out, well, okay, how can I proximate creativity. Um, so that's why you get a lot of these studies that look at the Eureka moment, the Aha moment where you are able to kind of put things together in a new way. That's one way that you can study creativity. But it's a V and we're learning a lot about that.

Speaker 2:          22:47          We're aligning how people can become better at that. But once again, that's a very, very specific type of creative thinking and being good at those kinds of Eureka problems is not the same thing as being more creative. Um, overall what we do know, um, that's something that everyone can do is that for whatever reason, being in nature helps people become better at problem solving. So being surrounded by trees, by water, um, kind of those types of things for whatever reason, make people better able to, um, to have insights into think of imaginative solutions. So it's not just a Eureka moment, it's also, you know, you'll become better eyebrow brainstorming. The quality of your brainstorm ideas becomes deeper. Um, and the more that we actually, the more we learned to pay attention, the more we focus on things. That's the other part of the puzzle. There's is this, this focus part of creativity.

Speaker 2:          23:50          People always say that it's, um, taking the breaks and those breaks are incredibly important, but you have to realize that for homes and for any other creative person, there's also a lot of hard work that comes before and you can't distract yourself while we're doing that. So homes does have these bouts of intense thinking, young concentration where he's really mulling over the problem before he takes his break. He takes his brake, he already has a lot of that work to through. And whenever you hear of, you know, people like [inaudible] or anyone else who is often used as an example of breakthrough creativity and they spent weeks, hours, you know, years sometimes mulling over problems. And so then the insight comes in a second. But there are different parts to that. So I think we can train our concentration, we can take more walks in natural habitats and those are the things we definitely know can help. Um, it's a field that's, that's getting more and more attention. I think people would really love to know how to become more creative. And the good news is that you can be, you can become more creative. And I think that everyone has the certain degree of creativity in them. It's not the type of thing, you know, you can't say, oh, I'm not a creative person. I don't think not creative people exist. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          25:06          Great. So listen up all you people who like me, who think of yourselves as creative and live in big cities, time to get out into the park. Um, and one of the most interesting points I think, you know, Maria that you make in your book, um, mastermind and, and in the big thing, mentor workshop, how to think like Sherlock Holmes, um, is this fact that this is that true? Like homes is a creative problem solver. That he does take information and recombine it in imaginative ways. You know, we tend to associate creativity falsely, um, with the arts. Uh, only often and, and, and think of science and, you know, being a detective as somehow more kind of rational, linear, analytical, not creative. And I think that's a really, really important point that you make. Um, okay. So, uh, with that said, um, said, did you have any follow up questions you'd like to ask before we, uh, four we wind this up. Uh, oh, I have a simple one and maybe it just got to be good way close. I'm kind of curious. Uh, Maria, did you ever have, or what was an Aha moment for you? I've been reading any of the, uh, home stories.

Speaker 2:          26:25          What was the Aha moment

Speaker 1:          26:27          or was there a particular Aha moment for you reading any of the stories where you just, you know, we're just kind of hits you and you're like, oh, that makes perfect sense. And the way that he was approaching a problem?

Speaker 2:          26:36          Well, I definitely had an Aha moment when I realized that I wanted to write about homes and started really reading all the stories and I was, it was more of a reading all of them in very close succession very, very closely, you know, underlining, highlighting, writing notes in the margins, kind of doing this very close reading. Um, and my Aha moment was that Sherlock Holmes really is a different type of thinker. The thinker that I remembered from childhood. And I think that he's often portrayed as being, because he's so imaginative and creative and warm and if not a cold machine at all. And it was very, to me it was one of those, Huh. Why do people always think of him as this logical Automaton, uh, as, as a computer when he's anything, but when all of the things that may come, Sherlock Holmes are things that a computer can't accomplish. And that to me was exactly, exactly. It was really eye opening because even from my childhood, from reading the stories, I didn't remember that I instead had that kind of stereotype of peace, this computer, just this perfectly logical person. He's anything about it.

Speaker 1:          27:55          Yeah. Okay, great. Um, so I, I want to thank everyone out there in the live audience for joining us today. Um, and Sid Burgess from our big thing mentor community and a special thanks to Maria Konnikova for being with us. Um, you've, you've been watching our big thing, mentor hangout with Maria Konnikova, author of mastermind, how to think like Sherlock Holmes. Um, visit youtube.com/user/big think mentor to take Maria's workshop on thinking skills from the master detective and learn life skills for personal and professional growth. I'm Jason Gods and editor with big think and thanks everyone for joining us today. Sit and Maria, thanks.

Speaker 2:          28:44          Thank you. Thanks for having us.
