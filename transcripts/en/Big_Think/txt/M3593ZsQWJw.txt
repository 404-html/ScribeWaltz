Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:12          when we bought discovery it was in terrible shape and the first priority was to turn the magazine around and three, capture the sense of excitement and it had say 10 and even 20 years ago and the web was there, but we let it lie fallow for a bit what we fixed the magazine. This is important because I wanted the magazine to have its own personality and energy DNA first. Then I wanted the web to capture that and I wanted it to grow into its own, its own personality, which was far more immediate news. You know, science news happens fast. It's regulatory when it happens. And most of all, I thought the people who had made a discovery will be most gushing to talk about it right at that time. So I wanted us to involve a lot more, um, scientists and I took the va with.

Speaker 2:          01:06          You may have read this in some of the precedents. I'm that scientists are rockstars in many ways. They're rock stars near community. There's certainly rock stars in their own heads. Let me tell you from personal experience. And uh, they have a lot to say. Of course, whenever they say it is brilliant and fascinating, I mean this is where sometimes the analogy diverge just because not that many rock stars of that fascinating when they, uh, opened up, but every scientist is and every scientist has a great sense of humor. By the way, that's something I, I, I tried to make sure we had some human that website. So a strategy with the web was same as it'll be with any magazine I run is be the personality of the core product, but have your own personality develop your own life because people consume the internet differently. They consume print. I mean the same person at the same time will shift from one to another but consume it in different ways in the same way that a smart person will follow the Financial Times and watch espn within the same 20 minute span. You know, W, w we do approach things differently. And I thought that the media, uh, on the web needed to be more immediate and more all encompassing and less of just sort of archived articles.

Speaker 2:          02:21          My first advice would have been that the print magazine had gone off its rails and it failed to recognize that times have changed. It was no longer a novelty to see erotic pictures. I'm forget the fact that you can see pictures in motion on the Internet. That wasn't it. It was the novelty and the need to see it and long gone. My father started that magazine not long after, and hefner started exactly around the time the national geographic was considered erotic because it printed nude tribal women from Africa. And so you put it in context. That's where this stuff came from. It arrives in the post aids age of the mid eighties when it's just, it's just not new. Uh, not new in a graphic way, something like maximum and loaded before it. In England, these things were new. They were sexy, they were sourcey. They were cheeky, but they had editorial about the rest of men's interest as the dominant part of the magazine.

Speaker 2:          03:24          And I think penthouse needed to shift in that direction. Maximum should never have come along. Panel should have usurped it. I'm now the web nonetheless. It's clearly an awful lot of people going to see it run a system on the web panels could have provided that I think, and I don't think it needed to have gone as hardcore as it did because I think it sort of stained the overall company. I would take the magazine very mild, a far more, more fun, Allah maximum or a loaded. Um, and I would have, um, taken the web to be whatever, almost subscription, whatever people wanted a, you know, again, you're asking me to advise my dad, which I really desperately wanted to do. Post facto. It's not important. We've had some of discussions. He agrees with someone that doesn't agree with a lot of it. And uh, my old man's a genius. So where he doesn't agree with me, I, I, I wonder maybe, maybe he's so something I did.
