Speaker 1:          00:07          I moved back to my neighborhood in the late nineties, after spending many years to try to disassociate myself from it because it was to me just the epicenter of urban blight and you know, it was dirty. It does smell funny. There were a lot of problems associated with it. And I'd also buy all my formative years were kind of watching the disinvestment of the community for both the financial sector as well, you know, as business sector as well. And it was a difficult place to be. So when I got to school, I got a chance to go away to school. I left and I swore never to come back. And it was only because I was so broke that I had to move back home with my parents. And um, but once I got there, you know what got me there was the fact that like there was this burgeoning art community there.

Speaker 1:          00:48          So that was great. And I was like, I was an artist, so I want it to be a part of that. But what kept me there was honestly getting politicized, you know, about recognizing that my poor community was actually being targeted, targeted as a place that for the repository, you know, for all of the bad things that you wealthier and usually wider communities could avoid. Um, I came back home to find out that our mayor Giuliani and Pataki, our governor, we're planning on building this huge waste facility on our waterfront. Um, that would've brought about 40% of the city's municipal waste to the area. Even though we were already handling about 40% of the city's commercial waste, it was an enormous amount of waste was going to be, again, put upon our backs. And so they were public health issues associated with that. And I just thought, why is this happening?

Speaker 1:          01:34          You know, I realized it was because it was a poor community and a poor community of color to the, and the whole idea of environmental justice is it just just simply means that no community should have to bear the brunt of lots of environmental burdens and not enjoy environmental benefits. And right now, race and class are great indicators as to where you're gonna find good stuff like parks and trees and really bad stuff like waste facilities. And it just really struck me as like, I want it to be a part of the solution and not just, you know, pretended it didn't exist or just,

Speaker 2:          02:07          yeah.
