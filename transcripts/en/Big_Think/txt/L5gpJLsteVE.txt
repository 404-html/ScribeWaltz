Speaker 1:          00:11          Well, I don't know if there's a single model we'd want to learn from. I think you want to take bits and pieces from, from, from a number of different models. But I think if you look to Europe, I mean some of the things you could say pretty much across the board, I'm thinking Western Europe, obviously the countries that are closest to the u s and living standards that they do work many fewer hours. And that is something that I think people, their value, the idea I know may Europeans, they're, they're amazed. They, they I think made them, don't even believe me when I say that people here don't have the cations. I mean, obviously a lot of people do, but there are many tens of millions of people that don't and there's certainly no guarantee of a vacation. Um, so paid time off that people know they could get four or five weeks vacation, which is absolutely standard in Europe.

Speaker 1:          00:49          Some countries, Denmark has six weeks. Um, so I think that's something that that's very valuable. Give people time off. Um, again, parental leave, uh, this is conservatives like to see a women stay home with their kids. I don't care whether it's women or men, but the idea that people have that option, I think that's very good because it's, it's a real strain for people to juggle a job and work. Um, so that makes a big difference. Um, energy use a Europe across Europe, average energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, about half of what is the United States. So even though they're very comparable living standards, they use much, much less energy. Part of that is that they have more mass transit. Part of is it's more concentrated, uh, people live closer together, which, uh, people wrongly in the United States, it's because we're such a big country that's really not the case.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And obviously we're a big country, but that's not why we're so spread out. We have land use policies that basically promotes sprawl. And in Europe, they've quite consciously designed policies that have been intended to fight sprawl. And I think it would make sense for the United States to do that as well. Make it easier for people live in the cities. Um, make it easier or near in suburbs rather than build out 90 miles, have people commuting an hour and a half each way each day. So a number of different practices that we could take from across Europe. And again, I don't think any single country we'd want to hold up as a model, but I think they're common practices that take different forms that we could look to across Europe, Canada, all. So I mean, it's not just Europe. Uh, we really are the outlier among the wealthy countries in a wide range of areas.

Speaker 1:          02:23          The World Bank I think is often played a fairly pernicious role over the last few decades. Uh, billy, uh, supporting a lot of bad projects, development projects and make great example here is Chad building an oil pipeline. There were, everyone knew what the garment Chad was corrupt and the world make bank made a big, big point of insisting that they were going to have all these safeguards to ensure that the, the money from the pipeline went to, uh, helping the poor people in Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world. And Lo and behold, what happened was the money went to the government. They used it to buy arms. Um, you know, that, that's just an example. I mean, they've had things like that all over the world. They've also promoted and a wide range of areas where I think it was often inappropriate at one, I'm most familiar with the social security in Latin America where they've got an almost every country in Latin America.

Speaker 1:          03:07          Brazil is the big exception to either wholly or partially privatized their social security system. And almost invariably it's led to very high costs, poor coverage rates, really not very good outcomes. And they've done that with water systems. So they, they very much promoted an agenda, which certainly serves a lot of corporate interests, often has not served the people who they're supposed to serve, which is the poor of the world. So in principle, I mean the World Bank's mission if you go into the building. And it really is kind of remarkable because it's a very opulent building. I mean, no one objects to people having nice offices, but it's really quite opulent with this big fountain, big atrium. And, um, up on the wall it says, our dream is a world free of poverty. And it's, it's just a, it's a, it's amazing they did that and there's no sense of irony to that. Um, anyhow, I mean, their mission is a very noble one. Unfortunately. I just don't see them having done very much to advance it. Okay.
