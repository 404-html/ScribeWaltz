Speaker 1:          00:08          Terms of what we need for this planet to have a future, um, and solve these big issues before it's too late. We need two things. We need this new methodology of some kind that I mentioned earlier, uh, and bringing up a new methodology of global problem solving, whether, whether it's the global issues network idea that I mentioned or some other idea that is for the heads of states to deliver or the prime ministers of this world to deliver on a. and individuals in that area can be active as voters, as lobbyists, as civil society and help push towards that direction. But the main way in which individuals can help is with regard to the second thing. We need to have a future on this planet. And that has to do not with methodological changes, but with mindset changes. The type of individual we need from Iran, uh, is an individual who feels that he or she is first global citizen. Second, only a national citizen. And third, only a local citizen. Right now we have it the other way round in the other way round is deadly for this planet. And so we should all try to, through education systems, through our children's, who the next generation pushed for that sort of mindset. Because without that new mindset, that global citizenship mindset, even a new methodology like the one I described would not be enough. You need the combination of the two.
