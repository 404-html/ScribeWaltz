Speaker 1:          00:08          From New York City, Manhattan, midtown.

Speaker 2:          00:12          Um, I grew up near the United Nations. And how has it shaped me? Um,

Speaker 2:          00:22          I think it's given me an urban sensibility, if you can say such a thing. Uh, which means that I feel really disoriented and uncomfortable in the countryside and much more comfortable and cities and m would rather go to a second or third tier New York City, then I wander out in the wilderness for a long time because then I would get scared. I think, uh, I'm, I'm one of those city people that is comforted by the sounds of the city, like ambulances and a car alarms, people screaming, uh, crazy people screaming in the middle of the night. And, uh, I, I do love, I actually do love going. Uh, I spent, I went to sleep away camp in Maine and I, that was really an ideal like time for me. Uh, so, but I tend to go back and forth between both extremes. Right now I'm in there.

Speaker 1:          01:36          I think it makes me, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:38          pretty scattered often when I'm in the city in New York. And, uh, when I, when I'm, I'm constantly moving around and doing things, it's a lot more difficult to find time to think and concentrate and have any kind of sustained thought. Um, so ideally I guess I'd like to go live back and live between the city and country, but I never have really done that. I, I sometimes went to friend's country houses, but when I was growing up, but I never had one. Uh, but I guess it makes me pretty scattered and a have a bad memory and prone to speaking and articulately.

Speaker 1:          02:20          He's a main contributions. I think the city. I love living in Brooklyn and

Speaker 2:          02:32          most of my friends were there and it, there's a sense of neighborhood. I live in Cobble Hill. And do you see people on the street that he recognize? Um, and don't talk to, cause that would be weird, but did you recognize them? And, uh, it's, it has a, I really like feeling, uh, being part of a neighborhood with some history and the part of New York where I'm from in midtown has been, um, torn up and, and mixed around. And, and the people who live there are people who weren't there when I was there when I grew up there. And, um, the buildings have totally changed the level of magnitude. Uh, when we're, when I grew up, it was a lot of buildings, like in the neighborhood I live in now, three, four story buildings. And now there are 90 story residential apartment buildings. Um, and it's, it's not a friendly place and I feel like a much more comfortable,

Speaker 1:          03:32          uh.
