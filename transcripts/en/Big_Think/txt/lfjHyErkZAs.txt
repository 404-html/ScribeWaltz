Speaker 1:          00:11          I spent a lot of time looking at foreign models. I actually chaired this year, the health governors at the World Economic Congress in Davos and I'm the current chair of the International Federation of Health plans and health plans from 80 countries around the world. And so I meet all the time with health plans from, from those other countries. And I've been looking hard to figure out which attributes of those plans would fit in the US. And one of the things I've learned from working with all those countries is that every single one does it a little differently. So the model in Germany looks a lot like the Netherlands, but it's not quite the same Austria different than both those, but the quite similar fact. The model had governor Schwarzenegger proposed in California last year looks suspiciously like the Australian model, uh, that every country does it slightly differently. But if I were going to pick a model that I think would, would transplant, well, it's actually the Dutch model.

Speaker 1:          01:14          I think the Dutch have done some really good things and the thing that they have added to their model more recently is a risk adjuster between the health plan. So when the health plans go out and recruit members and enroll people, uh, the government in the end does a, an assessment of who got the healthy people who got the less healthy people and if any health plan, God, a disproportionate number of healthy people, they have to actually pay some money back into the pool. And any health plan got too many sick people. They get more money from the pool. And so what that does is strongly encouraged, as we were saying earlier, the health plans to go after the sicker people and do a really good job taking care of sick people. Because I know in the end they get arrested the adjuster from the other plants that enrolled healthier people.

Speaker 1:          01:59          So I think the Dutch model of having a payroll deduction, individual choice of health plans and then the risk adjuster on the back end has a lot to offer, but it's a federal model. They basically, in the end of the year, run the core information about each health by how many diabetics do they have, how many congestive heart failure patients, how many asthmatic. They sort through the whole thing, and then basically when a formula and if you have enrolled a disproportionate number of people with those expensive diseases in the high level of morbidity, they increase your payment or if it's a low level of decrease your payment, and actually we do that to some degree in this country on our Medicare advantage program. There's already we have a risk adjuster formula that works in America. It's a pretty good formula. It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than no formula, and so we. We already have a history of doing that. We could. I could adapt to the Dutch model
