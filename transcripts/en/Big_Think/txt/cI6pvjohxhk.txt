Speaker 1:          00:08          The most prominent conspiracy theory was coming from a pan down insurance, a insurance company investigation that was ran by a guy called who pretend to be an officer, a code named abner that wrote the book vengeance. That was the basis for the Spielberg movie, Munich Olympic massacre. Everything that he wrote is false. I saw and I had numerous meetings and conversations with him every time that we reached a point where he was supposed to give me the smoking gun, one conclusive evidence that proves a that it wasn't that it was Iran sending the Pfl G, I'm a organization to take revenge for taking off the Uranian Airbus aircraft by the U. S Vincent's a ship by Mr and that the CIA had a unit called Korea that was involved in taking out a Pan Am 103 for their reasons. Every time that we reach that smoking gun. He said, no, no, it's in a safe in Europe. I will just about. I'm going to give it to you tomorrow. It will take me few more hours. I never saw any real conclusive evidence that connects Iran to this case or this connected Libyans and at the end of the day, while my Kadafi paid compensations, so I don't know from his point of view why I gave the person involved to a trump, why would he, why would he pay con conference con? Why would he pay any money for something that he didn't do?

Speaker 1:          02:01          A very positive example and very negative example to negotiating on nuclear issues. The very positive as Libya, the mic and CIA got involved with the son of Kadafi who convinced this father, who used to be considered the most crazy of all Middle East leaders to compromise and to give up everything for western support. This is very positive and they complied with all promises that they gave and disassembled the whole of their nuclear project. The negative example with be, of course, North Korea that sign a sort of a deal with President Clinton just to stall time and have more nuclear advancement that lead them to a bomb. Now, the lesson would be I think that the US should deal or should negotiate with Iran if the Iranians are willing to negotiate, the US cannot afford to refused negotiation with what I see as the worst security challenge the US is facing. And this is Iran. If Iranians are willing to negotiate, the US should deal with them without preconditions. I know that general, uh, Senator John Mccain, he preaches for preconditions. I don't support this view. I think that the US should go to the negotiation table, but just making sure that Iran is not just doing it as he did to your to gain time. If Iran is willing to negotiate the, uh, stopping the enrichment of uranium cutting relations with Iraqian Afghany, insurgencies stopping a to Hamas

Speaker 2:          03:44          and, uh,

Speaker 1:          03:46          stopping promoting his butler. I, I think that this would be great. This would be a major solution and a peaceful solution. And maybe the last chance before, before a striking Iran, I would gloomily globally a suspect that the Iranians will not give all this which they deem is a very interesting, very important interest. And at the end of the day, a much more harsh action would be taking place.
