Speaker 1:          00:08          Like heroes were actually the great dinosaur hunters of the American museum. Roy Chapman, Andrews granger on those guys say going a certainly a hero. I have a lot of heroes within my own disciplines that are probably too arcane. But Steven j gold was perhaps my greatest hero. I knew it very well. Uh, I knew him well enough that I got in trouble a lot with him. He started viewed me as this cantankerous, younger brother. He once told a Peter, you'll never be great, but you're pretty good now that that's quite a slap in the face, right? We all want to be great. But it was from Steve Say, Yo, I'm great and you're not as great as me. But, but I liked the fact that you're doing good work. And it was that sort of relationship. Okay. But I miss him. I miss his voice. He was the greatest single public speaker I've ever, ever heard. He was also the smartest man I've ever known. I've known quite a few intelligent people, but he was his, his processing speed was beyond belief. That's a great, it's a great voice. Lost
