Speaker 1:          00:04          I think key to Improv is always listening to embracing it's positivity, it's hearing things and not shutting them down. It's trying to find ways to make them work and I think in the business world, I would imagine that's very valuable. The idea that it's very frustrating to be told no all the time. Improv really revolves around the idea of like whatever you come at me with, I'm going to say yes to it. That's our reality. Let's get to work. Let's start there. So just the idea of saying yes to each other, not shutting down ideas, seeing if there's ways to make ideas workable, making that your default setting of like, I really want to respect what you're saying. See if there's a way to take it somewhere else versus here's all the things that are wrong with it. Think it's just a very positive mentality.

Speaker 1:          00:42          So I think a lot of people that come across it get very addicted to it because it does feel different. Especially as a New Yorker. We're just used to a world where everybody's kind of grumpy all the time and moving fast. They don't want to deal with each other. The idea of showing any emotion in public, not good, the idea of slowing down to deal with someone else's ideas and emotions. Not Good. Like we're New Yorkers. We want to get where we're going. So I think Improv really looks at a side of life that's like, well, what if we let all that go for a little while and just really work on sort of positively embracing each other's ideas and, and uh, and really listening hard to what other people have to say. So it's a pretty beautiful thing when it's going right. Very often what you'll see happen and improv classes when people get nervous about how it's going is they'll start saying, hey, when, when, uh, when dad gets home, he's going to be really mad.

Speaker 1:          01:32          Or they'll say like, hey, when we get to reno, stuff's really going to hit the fan. And they start saying like, hey, this thing that's going to happen, or this thing, hey, remember when you did that thing back then? I'm really mad about it. I think one of the things about listening is that it's always at it's most powerful when it's present, when it's right here, when it's right now, and that's been a lesson about Improv that I think just made me a much more social person. Like it just made me like when I would go have pitch meetings, I was just able to have it better. Even in my personal life, like I was just. I got when I, when I started really thinking hard about these improv lessons, not to get weird, but like my dating life just got so much better because the, the thing I always stress that I think apply just any conversation, I always ask people to answer these three questions when they're improvising.

Speaker 1:          02:18          Why these people? Why right here, why right now? I always just drill that why these people? Why right here, why right now? Meaning if you're not just. If you're in a scene and there's two people and you're talking about people who aren't here like they're not here, they probably aren't the most interesting thing for an audience to hear about. If you're talking about a different location than the scene, the scenes taking place in, then why isn't the scene unfolding there? It sounds more interesting. Why are you teasing an audience? So and another thing too, people will often go like, hey, you'll never believe what's inside this briefcase. And it's like, well that's invisible. Let's just talk to each other us things. We can find common ground, whether that's positive things, disagreements we might actually have. Why are these people in this location at this time?

Speaker 1:          03:04          Why isn't this the scene where choosing to show the audience so the more we can just make things present between the people right there, the less the audience has to suspend their disbelief and imagine the better the listening is going to be and the harder it's going to hit. And what we find when that happens in Improv is your simple choices can actually get huge reactions because if you and I were doing a scene and I came at you and start at the scene by saying, you know what, like everything that happened in Canada, we can never talk about it again. That sounds like it has really high stakes, but now the audience has to figure out, well what happened in Canada and why are we all scared of it? Whereas if I just looked at you and said, hey, I'm so scared and I need you to help me through it.

Speaker 1:          03:49          That sounds like a more vague thing with less comedic potential, but an audience that they're scared and you have to help each other. Why? Why are they scared? They're scared right now and they can help each other. Great, and it's a human connection that we can latch onto, so being present in the moment with each other. Nothing else you're going to work out. It's gonna. Make your improv scene so much better. I feel it makes a lot of conversations better to. I'm a really big fan lately of the phrase slow as slow, as fast, slow as fast, and what I mean by that is like, especially in the context I can, I can speak to it in the context of people who go on stage, which is like we forget that when we're on stage and we're improvising and we're bouncing ideas back and forth and audience, it's really hard for them to keep up and they don't really know why we're making the choices we're making because we're trained in this and we have classes in this so we can go.

Speaker 1:          04:41          So that to. To them it looks like it's moving a million miles an hour. Like most people when they see an Improv show, if they like it, they remember that first one is being like the best show they ever saw and it probably wasn't. It's probably just that these people knew what they were doing. So much. So one of the things I always like to stress about slowing down, slowing down, slowing down is this idea. It's actually something that I learned from my wife uses this phrase because she is an aerialist shit. Her, she was an aerialist for many years. She was a dancer who would do all this work with harnesses and rigging and flying around from the ceiling and she told me that phrase and it's stuck in my head because she always said like, if you have a problem with your harness, you want to get it fixed fast so you can go back to the the act you want to get back in there.

Speaker 1:          05:21          But remember to the people watching like no matter how long it takes, no matter how slowly move, you're still flying around in the sky. And I think for Improv that really applies well. If like no matter how we can really take a breath, the audience is going to be blown away if we do our jobs right. We don't need to move fast to impress them like the, the desires. Just joke, joke, joke, laugh, laugh, laugh at that. But you can smother it. So another thing I often say about it too is like we have to remember when we're improvising that like it's sort of like building a fire, like you have to start with the kindle and you have to start with just a spark and you can't just throw the big logs on. If you just try to pile everything on, it's not going to go anywhere.

Speaker 1:          05:59          The audience is going to smell a rat. I'm not going to be with it. So for me, I think the advice I can give anyone is just remember someone who is a professional doing what they do at any speed is probably going to blow away and novice. They're probably going to have total control. And when we rush, we actually can give that away. I think when we consciously take a breath and slow down at demonstrates like confidence and mastery of our craft, which I know is a very pretentious thing to say, but that's what I used to say to people when I taught them in their improv acting classes, which can be kind of pretentious. So that's the main thing is remember what we do is impressive. We don't need to speed through it because they're going to be blown away as long as we do it with integrity.
