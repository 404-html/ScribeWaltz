Speaker 1:          00:09          No, in actual fact we haven't discovered a huge amount of obesity genes at the moment, but you know, they're almost certainly is and we know that there are genes involved in the development of predisposition to diabetes and so on and we know that diabetes is going to becoming a massive problem over the next sort of 20 to 30 years ago. Estimates in the range of $400, million people with diabetes by 2030 around the world. And what we're, what we would like to understand is how does your genetic predisposition interact with your environmental predispositioned to, you know, culture, um, what, um, what kind of foods that you eat, you know, et Cetera, et cetera. And that's the piece that we want to try and understand and sort of tease apart and what for diabetics, what does that mean in terms of your likelihood of getting cardiovascular disease and so on.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So I think those are the areas in which is going to be a lot of work to try and sort of understand the differences in populations and the differences in rates of obesity between different populations. How much of that is genetic, how much of it is environment and what can one do to get a to get around the other? So what, what kind of lifestyle changes can you make to get around your genetic predisposition to developing obesity and, and also what kind of behavioral components might make it difficult or easy for you to do that? You know, because it's often very difficult for people to change their lifestyle. And that's where I, that's where it's often a big challenge. So we all know we're supposed to do in order to keep healthy most of the time, but it's difficult to do.
