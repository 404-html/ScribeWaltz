Speaker 1:          00:09          Is to do it all the time. The challenge is to sit there basically because there's so many times when you just want to flee. Um, it's, it's not the life that I would have thought. Um, it's more difficult in some ways. The actual act of writing is both more difficult and more rewarding. The re you have searched states of something like ecstasy in your writing, um, when it goes well, when it goes specially well, and that's not something you can imagine when you're first starting out. It certainly wasn't what happened to me those first few times I wrote poems. Um, but then the going on with it is quite hard. There was a period when I renounced it when I was, oh, how old was there? Right after I published my first book, my life was a mess. I was separating from my then wife and I just decided let this life of a poet is Kelly.

Speaker 1:          01:13          May I have to do something else? But I couldn't. Well, I thought of writing screenplays. I had a friend who was a director in Hollywood and I said, I want to be a director. And they said, that's impossible, but try writing some screenplays. So I sat that and I started and I found it very boring. So I just sat at my desk for a few months, really doing nothing but keeping the same hours I did when I was writing poetry. And then I started writing again and I started writing in a new way and it was very exciting. It was actually after my second book,

Speaker 1:          01:58          it's always difficult question for a power. What's next? Um, you never know whether you're going to write another poem. That's one of the, I mean, you have faith that you will, but you never know for sure. You never know for sure. If the light will come with the force, will take it with the music will happen. So sometimes I think maybe I should try something else now. Maybe I should write the novel I never wrote or something. Although I really have no gift for that or no patience for, but I hope out, just write some pounds. I lie.
