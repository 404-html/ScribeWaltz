Speaker 1:          00:08          Well Bank was created in 1944 before the world war two Sargo was over. It was created together with the Monetary Fund, International Monetary Fund and what it was going to be late to the WTO, the World Trade Organization in the case of the bank. Uh, its main purpose was to borrow money on the markets in those days, Europe more than the u s and to lend this money for the reconstruction of Europe, of Japan and so forth. So it was very bold design for the times. And it did that in the 50s. Mostly it was in during construction business. It finance the reconstruction for instance of Toyota in the in Japan or the financing for the reconstruction of the French railway system came from there. Then in the 60s that preconstruction job was over. It went into developing country business, uh, lending for hospitals, for highways or ports for agriculture in the developing world, starting mostly in Latin America and then going worldwide.

Speaker 1:          01:20          And it really became the World Bank that is known today under Mcnamara. And Mcnamara came from the u s government to become a very famous president of the World Bank in the 70s. He made it grow to a much bigger place than it was originally. Originally. Ted Let less than a thousand people in Washington and today it has 12,000 people roughly. And he got the World Bank into social areas, into education, into hell's, into nutrition, into what was called basic needs, integrated rural development and so forth. And so it became the largest and most, uh, sort of broadest development institution in the world. And that it is still today, even though it's a very much change. Well, there's still a lot of that work to be done. It still operates by borrowing money in the markets by issuing bonds, using the money for very long term loans, which all have to do with some development purpose.

Speaker 1:          02:27          And then when the loans get three reimbursed by the clients, uh, we repaid to bondholders. That's the, the way the World Bank works for the very poor countries. It has a special Katie, which is not based on borrowing money. It's based on donated money. It's called the International Development Association window or Idi Window. And that leads to very long term loans without an interest rate, uh, or on grand terms for very poor countries under roughly a thousand dollars per person. So it's an institution that's a sort of bank in a way. There is a sort of financial function, financing function, but it's also full of people who have a lot of knowledge of what works and doesn't work in education and road surfacing and building latrines in a textbook, publications for schools, uh, and cataract operations, you name it. So it's not just a money bank, it's a knowledge bank at the same time. And lately it has become very active also in a big global issues like global warming, uh, the ozone depletion, uh, the pollution of the seas and so forth. So it is still mainly in the poverty reduction business and the development business, but it's beginning to become a presence in the global issues business as well.
