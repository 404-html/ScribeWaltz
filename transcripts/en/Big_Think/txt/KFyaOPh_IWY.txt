Speaker 1:          00:09          That neurological process includes a sale as soon as, okay, make a reaction at the level of the signups. And uh, and this is serious, overreaction leads to a changes in the connection. The synopsis changes that include both the, uh, uh, the, uh, I was just say changes in the receptors are located. The signups is such that these receptors respond in a different way and change in the release of neurotransmitter of the sign opsis and eventually changes in the, uh, the level of the morphology of the signups,

Speaker 1:          00:59          uh, such debt. There was enough, Dick response becomes much, much stronger and even an addition to that for this memory to last long, there have to be changes in the, uh, at the level of the genes that the top part of our DNA and, uh, that are long lasting so that our genetic changes with the formation of new proteins in the cells that uh, uh, wouldn't live. And it's a sign, it's, it's changed in the, over their eyes. It's plastic changes. Or like as far as more protein, a new proteins formed at this. I have the signups. You say men wanting pass through similar processes to save our point first year, memorize what I'm saying. Then you consolidate this something that you can recall it when you need to remember. Then you can reconsolidate it's a process which has several steps are phases.

Speaker 1:          02:23          I bet that it depends on the particular moment in which you are trying to recall that memory on certain processes that uh, no longer happen in the brain or they are blocked, some chemical reaction occur and they interfere or did not occur and interfere with this process of recalling in a certain moment. And then, uh, then, uh, two shown some data still remember it. Maybe because you make an association something in that moment that the house too, like, you know, so if you associate something with a particular older, I make an example and then the other camps, then the memory comes up. It's just those options. It's also to remember, well, I mean obviously I bet that smell is much more important for a dog. And then few months, although there are humans or exercise their sense of this male and afforded a probably much better than I am now.

Speaker 1:          03:37          I mean, there is differences between St Louis a way of learning according to the people and we're not the same. Uh, it's like a door that send people a is more open one door, then another sword or so they use it one particular way more than others. So there are differences. But if we accept to the way in which the memory gets in the chemical process that once this thing is getting that they're very, very similar inside of the brain. They are very, very similar for different, uh, um, call input of memory coming from different ways through different mechanisms. And they're very similar in humans and they're very similar in between the different animals.
