Speaker 1:          00:06          I am a middle school student from Washington state, as you already know, our environment is threatened by human right now and it's time to make a change, but a lot of people don't see this rack or they don't want to make a change. The question is, how can we get to influence human to protect the planet in order, something important actions we can do starting right now to save the world. I know it's hard, but I just hope that you could give me some clue. Thank you very much.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Victoria. Victoria, you are, uh, the key to the future, my friend. So here's the thing, you're living in Washington state. You know, I lived in Seattle for many years. I love Washington. Go seahawks. I'm right there, my friend. Go Mariners. Now you are in middle school. You are the future. People will tell you that, but they're not kidding. So what we want you to do is influence your parents and make sure they vote. Voting is the most important thing for us, especially this year. And I want your parents. I want you to encourage your parents to take the environment into account when they picked people to vote for. Now you're a governor. Jay inslee's, an acquaintance of mine, and he's a big environmental issue and he wrote a book Apollo's fire and so on. It's about the future, but people are doing to take care of the environment and have energy produced electricity, especially renewably without having to burn fossil fuels.

Speaker 2:          01:37          So it's, it's up to you to influence your parents. Yes, very important to recycle your plastic and your paper. Very important to uh, and also in Washington state. I'm not sure exactly where you live, but you can recycle your food waste along with your yard waste. And that becomes compost, which nurses nourishes our farms, which in turn produces food part of the mythic cycle of life. So you can encourage your parents to do that, but we need big ideas, big changes we need in Washington state. There's enormous opportunities for wind, turbans and enormous opportunities for photovoltaics, for solar cells that takes sunlight and make it right into electricity, especially in eastern Washington. So you can be part of that and you're in middle school, there was a turning point for most people in their science education. So I hope you Victoria will apply yourself in science class and biology, physics, chemistry, and there's probably another class you might have about a planetary science or astronomy and earth science.

Speaker 2:          02:43          And the other thing Victoria is really important, especially for girls is Algebra a and I just want to tell you Algebra is this, this way to think. It trains your brain to think in this way that enables you to imagine to imagine things to, to accept that you don't know the answer, but you're going to find it. And so, um, I really encourage you, I just tell you that I took Algebra. You just have to practice. There's no way around it. You just gotTa do it over and over to you to get comfortable with it. And you can do it. And by the way, when you're a girl in middle school, you're kind of better at everything than the boys. Now that'll change in the next four or five years. I mean, you'll even out, but right now, just go with it, my friend. Go with it. Make sure you learn Algebra and learn science so that you, if you choose to be a scientist or better yet an engineer, which is a profession in which you use science to solve problems and make things that you can lead the world in these new technologies, but right now, uh, do those things at home that make that, make an important difference at home recycling and not wasting energy, not wasting clean water. And make sure your parents take the environment into account and make sure they vote. Thank you Victoria. Go get them.
