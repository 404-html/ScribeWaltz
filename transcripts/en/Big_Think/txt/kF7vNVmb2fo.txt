Speaker 1:          00:00          The question, why are some Americans, people in the world homophobic, why do they fear the gay and why did they oppose, at least in America so strongly, gay marriage, gay unions. I am not convinced that that many people really have a problem with gay marriage. I think there are some people who absolutely hate and fear the gay and are very opposed to the gay marriage. I think it has become a consistent and dependable fundraiser to where if every homosexual person in America said, okay, we're awful, we have a bad lifestyle and will slither under the rock that we, that we should be living under and we'll never asked to be married again, so we'll just take our queer assets and scuttled back into the slimy shadows where we belong with the slugs. They would lose a major fundraising tool and people in the room would go, no, no, no.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Come back queer marriage. Want to get married? Guy, we need you in the Bible belt. We need you in South Carolina, Arkansas, Florida, Texas. To raise the bucks because Islamophobia only goes so far, but hating the gay. That one always runs that one. Always performs, so you'll always, you'll always have that, you know, up for debate. What makes people fear the gay and gay marriage is because you're giving these people equality and that's the biggest fear that people with power have that you'll get some two people get married. To me, the whole contract is completely insane. I live in the state of California. If I married some Nice Gal and we got divorced by law, does she get half of my record collection was no way. She might after I get done with a chainsaw, but she's not getting my ramones first pressing. Oh No, no.

Speaker 1:          02:04          She's not getting my Bob Ludwig mastered version of houses. The holy high. I think not. She can go on Ebay and overpaid like I did for her own copy. So marriage for me is I love to go to weddings, but I don't want to be married, but if two people are crazy enough to be that in love with each other, that's a great thing. Give them a break. Lights really short. Let him have a little happiness. There's two men, they're married, they're in a house. Houses are. No, it doesn't smell any different, it doesn't look any different than the lawn looks fantastic, but a gay, if you don't want to, gay marriage and don't have one. Same thing with abortion. No woman wants to have an abortion, but they gotta have the right to have one safely without any. Your opinion does not matter here and so in, in this century there's going to be gay marriage is going to be okay in a more than half of the United States, but we used to have slaves, so that's why we have amendments to the constitution, so it has wiggle room.

Speaker 1:          03:15          I think that gay marriage is already covered under the first amendment, so I, I think this conversation's over to where there shouldn't be against anything against the law about two men or women getting married. It always breaks down to a religious thing and they'll tell you, well know they have all the equality they need and Rara. Wow. Okay. Then are you, are you, are you one of those radical Christian as well? I am. That has nothing to do with it. It it, it kind of does a lot, and so that's it. Basically you have ignorance and you have hatred. What a lot of these people don't understand is they are surrounded by the gay, you know, they got gays in their family. At thanksgiving I was at, I went to an all boys school and I had gay bosses as a kid growing up. I lived in Washington DC, which is just a lot of gay people.

Speaker 1:          04:03          My mom had gay friends. I, I got it, I understood it. I never feared it. You know, my, my, my Boston high school at the movie theater with this was this amazing man of Portuguese descent with incredible hair who's like a fantastic old school and like, like character actor, Oldschool Queen, like, you know, his name was Bob on Saturday nights he reverted to Roberta. Roberta, yes. And like I, I spent high school with this guy every Saturday night at the movie theater. We had the best time and if, if my uptight friends from my suburban prep school could have seen who I was hanging out with, I don't know what they would have thought. So I had no problem with the gay, but it also gave me good Gaydar and in high school, well we all hit like ninth and 10th grade, whatever. I realized like we've got gay, we have at least two gay teachers and I've got gay gay peers.

Speaker 1:          04:58          There's gay students. One guy's Kinda like, you know, a mini Dick Cheney's that are just keeping it to himself. One guy like, yeah, you're gay and you're, you know, you're, you're, you're okay with it, you know, he's keeping it to himself. And this is one poor guy who was like, you know, gay right now. And he hit 10th or 11th grade and like, Hello September at all. Like, no, no, because I just saw what was gonna happen to him and we had some really bad teachers there and one teacher would make fun of him, made fun of his name and turned it into an anti gay slur. So that teacher basically greenlighted him if you know the term, basically a green light of the guy for is a death warrant because once the teacher can do that, that means you can do that. This is not good leadership that teachers should have never as an adult with a bunch of stupid high school students, me being one of them should have never okayed that and by the end of the school day, this guy had his head put in the toilet.

Speaker 1:          05:59          He was a dorm kid. We had a dorm at the school for post grads and kids who live far from home and he got teased enough to where he locked himself in his room and tried to kill himself by slashing his wrists. Thankfully he did not succeed, but at Christmas break he left. He never came back. His name was never mentioned in the school again, ever. Not by any teacher ever. He never happened. And that politicized me. That made me Auntie homophobe. I don't know how you say it, but you know, gay rights to me is it's civil rights and it when I see racism, which I encountered having it being done to me as a kid from the sixties and Washington DC. When I see homophobia, it's Kinda like, it's that straw that breaks the camel's back. And I'm the camel. I, I, I go hard against it real hard, real loud, real flagrantly, real right now.

Speaker 1:          06:52          And so what you combated in America is a lot of undereducated people who have some idea that Christianity is about beat up on the gay. A lot of people just like to hate and a gay person even though you're surrounded by them. And I, as I, as I tell my audiences that show, they go dig it. There was gay cavemen, you know, it gets your head around that. There was like big hairy men from millions of years ago going like, Hey, let's, you know, let's go hit the bushes and like see what's up. You'll gay pirates case, Mri, k everything. And that's how it is. Why some people can't absorb and accept and deal with that information. It's too bad. I believe things are getting better. I think homophobia is an endangered species in America as long as I'm around it is. And I know I'm not the only person pushing against him. So.
