Speaker 1:          00:13          I don't think that is being overly optimistic or if it is, I'm, I'm right there. And I think a lot of other people who care about creativity, creativity, not just for the sake of art itself, but creativity as a way of looking at problems, looking at human beings, looking at the world from a number of different angles. At the same time, I think that what we've seen from a lot of Obama's political utterances that I think is very resonant with people who have sort of chosen the creative life and who find inspiration for the creative life is that there's not one answer. Many things are sometimes true at once. You can be in the midst of contradiction and not have that be a stopping point, but rather be a weigh station on the road forward. We've heard a lot of that kind of language from him and I think that that's something certainly that great literature tries to show us as well. Um, that, you know, for example, to be American is not one thing to be American is multi experiential, multilingual. Um, it is, it is many, many, many different aspects of the human experience. And that's really part of what makes this, in my opinion and incredibly interesting country with a very, very vibrant arts scene. Uh, it is that essence that is not one thing. And, uh, so I think that, that, that comfort with contradiction is something that we've seen from the president as well. So I see that as, you know, fertile ground for the area.
