Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13          got very, very little to do with the construction of the welfare state economic model. That was one element of the economic model that was fundamentally flawed. We are the fixed exchange rate policy and that was untenable. We try to defend the fixed exchange rate with interest rates up to 500 percent. That was ridiculous. It was a failure, but we were so indoctrinated. We had lived with a fixed exchange rate regime all our lives since the early thirties and we could not imagine that was something wrong with the fundamental element of our economic policy. When that was abolished, the economy took off and we've had much more flexible situation since then and today. It is one of the fundamental assets of our economy that we are flexible enough to set interest rates according to our own needs, high interest rates if you have overheating innovation and can stimulate by low interest rates when recession is that threatening, and I think that was one of the main elements of the shocks that we experienced in the late eighties. We had a shock from the financial markets and as you know, financial markets destabilized. They don't stabilize ID stabilize economies, the destabilized our economy, we could not do anything about it because we did not have in our possession the interest rate weapon because we had a fixed exchange rate regime and I think that was a much more important explanation.
