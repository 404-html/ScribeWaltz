Speaker 1:          00:00          The Arctic, a wash for centuries, uh, largely unknown, very remote part of the Western world. And it was only 100 years ago that to discover is starting to go to the North Pole and to these remote areas and then the cold war or close to the Arctic in terms of military confrontation and the conflict between the Soviet Union on one hand, the western powers on the other. Joe, one of the most important things to remember when we look at the Arctic and the beginning of the 21st century is that it is show recently that we as mankind have been able to come together to discuss on the site what do we do with respect to the Arctic future. There is no part of planet us, which are so recently arrived on our desk as a challenge and as an opportunity. So therefore the corporation in the Arctic is one of the most crucial issues of the 21st century.

Speaker 1:          01:19          For many reasons. One age that uh, this is the front line, no climate change. The aggression melting of the ice in the Arctic will have consequences all over the world. They've only our quarter of the greenland ice sheet melts. This will lead to two meters rising sea levels everywhere in the world. And already we are seeing that the present melting of the Arctic Sea ice is causing extreme weather events in the United States, in Asia, I than other parts of the world. In audition, the Arctic is one of the richest parts of the world in terms of untapped natural resources. And with the continuous melting of the Arctic Sea ice, uh, there will be a new shipping lines linking Asia to America and Europe in a revolutionary way, like the Suez Canal on the Panama Canal. That in his time a lot of this, why the Arctic has now become the new economic and political playing field.

Speaker 1:          02:29          In 2015 the United States takes on the chairmanship of the Arctic Council. It is the first time we change the Arctic Council became a treaty making organization, but the US takes on that responsibility and the chairmanship is not the US, uh, a formal role. Uh, it's just supposed to provide a vision, uh, a policy agenda and a direction towards the future joints. And very important that all the people in the United States or introduced it in climate change or interested in the environment, realize that in the next two or three years, the US will be in the leadership role with respect to the future of the Arctic, of course, in partnership with other Arctic countries as well as the option of the states from Asia and Europe. Although the Arctic council liaison intergovernmental body, there is a role for activists and environmentalist, a expert scientist, ordinary people in this process. And in order to facilitate that together with many other partners from the Arctic, I established last year what's called the Arctic Circle, which is a kind of a on the international assembly where everybody, whether it's a, an individual or citizen or, or government or corporation or a scientific institute or university or activist group can come together where everybody has the same role, the same rights to speak on and discuss.

Speaker 1:          04:15          So I would encourage, especially the next two or three years, everybody who is concerned about these issues in the United States. First of all, to look at the Arctic circle on the website, Arctic circle.org and see if you want to come to the assembly or if you want to attend the forum meetings that will take place in the United States in Greenland and Singapore as well as Iceland in the next 12 to 18 months. But I'll, we'll all be aware that your own country, the United States of America, well from 2015 2017 be the leader in making policy and agreement and map out the future for that part of planet does, where climate change is most aggressively taking place. There was a big great march in New York about the climate at hundreds and thousands of people participated. I'm not sure if many of them realized that in the early months of next year it will be the u s who will chair the international cooperation on that part of mother Earth where climate change is most aggressively taking place.
