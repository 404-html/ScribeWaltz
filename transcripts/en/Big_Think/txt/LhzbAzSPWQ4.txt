Speaker 1:          00:09          Why superiors is, it's funny, it's, it's a little like the waves of grief. I think you have waves of awareness. Um, and one of the things that I found with grief was actually I was well, well prepared for it by the cyclicity of my manic depressive illness and because I was used to things coming and going, um, and so forth. So I think that my awareness of having a bipolar is really, you know, have 17, I got very, very depressed and I was like [inaudible] I didn't have any energy and it was totally, I just, but I didn't have the words. People didn't talk about it at that time. And people that certainly didn't have the words bipolar Ellis or manic depressive poles. So I just was terrified. Um, I had no idea what had happened to me and I was very frightened and I was frightened it would come back.

Speaker 1:          01:03          But I got well and then I did what everybody or most people do when they get well. I sort of put it behind me again and then it would come and hit me again and again. And so I knew there was something wrong. Um, I started to see a psychiatrist, tried to see a psychiatrist when I was in college and I ended up just running away and I couldn't tolerate the idea of doing that. Um, but then when I was, I actually got my degree and I, I joined the medical school faculty at Ucla. I became raving Lee Manic and very psychotic and hallucinating, delusional. I didn't have any choice. And it was the gray. It's the great advantage of having an illness as severe as mine is that you are automatically brought into the medical care system if you have until as long as it was milder, I could kind of get by with actually having to face what was the severity of my problem.

Speaker 1:          02:00          And I, I knew the person I wanted to see. It was somebody I had trained with. He was my clinical supervisor and I had seen him with patients and I had seen that he was tough and smart and compassionate and humanists, but also new science and in medicine. And so I went to him terrified and he was just absolutely ferman his diagnosis. He just never wavered. Um, and he just said that's the way it is. But he was kind about it, but he didn't back off from it. And he was a great psychotherapist. And so one of the things I've tried to do in my professional life, like a lot of my colleagues, is to emphasize, you know, medications just aren't enough for many people who have these illnesses because exactly what you're saying is how do you become aware of an illness? You become aware of an illness by understanding yourself and understanding the meaning that that illness has in your own life symbolically and more importantly, quite literally.

Speaker 1:          03:01          I've primarily been in the psychotic when manic, uh, which is not uncommon with mania. And, um, it's been mostly when I've been manic, it's been a very exhilarating sort of thing, including the hallucinations. Um, I went around the solar system, I went to Saturn. I, in my mind's eye, I went through the star fields. It was, it was a glorious, are ecstatic experience, which is frequently the case with mania. When you think about a lot of the great religious ecstasies is a very manic quality to that and a very grandiose and they tend to be very universal, cosmic related to everything's related to everything. Um, but I also had some very bad ones. I've, you know, I'm hallucinating myself is dead or as I'm just covered with blood, I mean mania is, can be as terrifying as it gets. It is certainly as insane as one gas.

Speaker 1:          04:04          And so it's, it's frightening when it gets out of control, but there are periods of mania where it can be extremely attractive. Unfortunately, probably true in depression. Your capacities you feel just flattens and disappears and what you feel is pain. Um, and, and it kind of paint that you can't describe to anybody. So he is, so it's an isolating pain. I can put the isolating pain. Um, it's for people with bipolar roles in particular. Um, it is a, a deadening, um, lethargy in a coupled with an agitation and restlessness at times, but it's a sense of having no energy, no interest on no passion in their life. And so for me, like everybody else who gets to really depressing, you know, there comes a point when you say, okay, if I, if I can't feel, if I can't care, if I can't think, I can't concentrate, I can't remember.

Speaker 1:          05:04          I can't read. Um, if I can't love, where am I? Who is in there? Where's the humanity? It's gone. And, um, the pain is agonal adjust is unrelenting. In my case, I had stopped my medicine, my looked at him and I gotten a wildly manic and then I got paralytics be depressed for 18 months and there was not a time during those 18 months, I can remember feeling okay. And at some point I tried to kill myself. And I think again, it's very hard to describe the kind of pain that goes on in severe depression because it's just, the words are not there.
