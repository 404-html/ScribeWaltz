Speaker 1:          00:00          Definitely do not get sucked into the mindset that these things are inherently top heavy or front end costly or anything. It's absolutely not true. It was possible to do it much more efficiently than a lot of people told us was the case. When we surveyed the landscape of what was out there in this particular sector, even of it stuff, and we dug around a little to sort of investigate what kind of costs labor, what goes into this. We were pretty stunned to find out what people were spending on the front end to engineer these things, put them up. We had a really hard time figuring out what people were spending all that money on to create, we think very bad products. What is possible for a young person with an idea in terms of executing it today even more than five years ago, certainly more than 10 years ago in terms of the speed with which you can engineer things, the software that's available in an open source way for you to construct these things. Suffice to say, I think if people knew what it took, what it costs us to set crowdrise up, they'd be staggered. I think it's like fractional compared to some of the other big name things that you've heard about.
