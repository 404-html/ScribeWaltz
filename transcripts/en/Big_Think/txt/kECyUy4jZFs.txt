Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, that's another great question. I actually think of myself primarily as a political intellectual and so, um, I think, uh, a lot of what drove me into legal academia was at, rather than another kind of academia was the idea that I wanted to do something that was politically engaged with the world. So my first level is literature as an English major. As an undergraduate. I still teach law and literature classes. I do actually think that literature, it's a lot to tell us about civil rights, but at the same time I was very politically active and many, many humanists to go to law school, have their stories so it need not detained as long. But my thought was if I actually care about these causes, I can probably do more for them than to write papers on the renaissance about them. And so when I went to law school and I thought, really, maybe I should go into practice, but once I delved into the practical or the world of practice, I should say, uh, I quickly realized that part of what was really important to me was the ideas and intellectual enterprise. And so I split the difference by becoming a legal academic who is very engaged in politics and in activism, particularly gay rights activism, but civil rights activism or broadly, uh, who nonetheless, I hope is trying to generate some new ideas about how this kind of activism activism.
