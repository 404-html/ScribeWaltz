Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13          well I think first of all, if we didn't have electronic applications that you wouldn't see quite that same kind of growth. I think a second of all is that, uh, that I, I see that as a good sign because those, those institutions are a recognized as being. Institutions have great excellence worldwide excellence. So if more and more students think of themselves as world class scholars, uh, it's great that there's that many kids that want to go out to the very best schools. Uh, when I, when I talked to parents and students, what I emphasize is there's so many great schools in America and is a minister told me once when I was quite young and he was talking about the people that came to him for advice. He said, I told him there is not a college or university you go to that you can learn all they have to teach you. So I believe that we have a great number of great institutions in this country and your future doesn't depend upon going to the very best that people can get a great education. And, uh, if you look at people that are successful in this country, not all of them have gone. Certainly many of them haven't gone to what we would consider the most elite schools in the school.
