Speaker 1:          00:05          No, some people try to draw a line and say, well, some animals are this and other animals, so not, and there are differences across species, but all species, all individuals within a species deserve to be treated with respect and compassion. As individuals. I see everything on a continuum. I see psychological continuity between humans and the other animals and across a dolphins and primates, and that simply reflects the fact that evolution works by building upon existing structures and processes. So that's reflected in the fact that we all share a common psychology and each species each. If you're an individual, no matter whether you're a dolphin or a monkey or a person or an Aardvark, you have that basic psychology that's just changed a little bit depending upon what species you are.
