Speaker 1:          00:03          The animal kingdom is full of, uh, an amazing, amazing behaviors typically in which males are trying to attract females. Um, so most of the time through the animal kingdom, females are the ones who tend to be very choosy. I'm so they pick between different males based on their attributes in part because males typically don't donate much other than their good sperm and they're good jeans. Uh, so females, females tend to care a lot about your, how good a male looks you, how awesome his song is, how great his dances and so on. And this leads to a pressure for males to kind of ratchet it up and have a bit of an arms race in terms of how awesome their dances and their song is. And so on, some of my favorite examples of a kind of males ratcheting it up, um, our cases of a species known as the buff breasted Sandpiper.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Um, it's this otherwise kind of drab looking Brown Arctic bird. It's a drab looking because know lives in the Arctic, very hard to get food and do everything. Um, but it kind of allows for it's beauty to come out and really strange ways and one of these ways is that it has an incredibly attractive armpit. So it's armpit is very white, very clean, and it will do a flash displays for females were males will kind of get out in the field and sort of flash it's armpit. And if the female like the armpit, they kind of fly from miles and miles and then they'll kind of do this wonderful display, uh, in the female's fall for it. They think this is wonderful, but you can tell, you know, kind of which males have the sexy armpits by, you know, which ones are kind of flashing all the females were there.

Speaker 1:          01:35          And so on. Uh, they're also, uh, other species in which males do incredible dances to move females. Uh, there's a species of bird known as a mannequin in which a males actually do a really elaborate dancing display. It actually involves two partners. So there's a kind of senior male who gets to mate with the females and another male who apprentices with him and has to learn the dance. And the female picks on the dance of both of them, even though the senior guy gets the girl. But then eventually the apprentice will kind of inherit the dancing court and get the lady.
