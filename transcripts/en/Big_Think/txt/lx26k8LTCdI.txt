Speaker 1:          00:00          In my book, ideal, right away with a meeting of meaning because I knew I would be attacked like a disturbed nest of Hornets by philosophers if I did not. And of course meeting has a number of meanings, but generally speaking, after you've gone past the basic religious definition of meaning, which is, well, of course the divine creator, uh, is responsible for the design, then a nature of humanity. And what else do you want to know? Uh, after you get past that particular response? Uh, then the subject moved to meaning as history. That is essentially what are we and why, where do we come from? And this is part of meetings who were, are we was most likely to be headed. And I like to suggest that in order to answer those questions, we cannot do it with religion because every religion has or ever religious faith rather has a different creation story.

Speaker 1:          01:23          Story of how the universe and earth and people came into being. And every faith has its own special accounts of supernatural events and they differ one from the other and they are in competition. And in any case, they, uh, cannot be boiled down to any kind of a coherent explanation because religious face is very much a product of human culture and we can't really figure out just what we are, what our meaning is by introspection. I'm reminded of the statements of Darwin made in one of his notebooks, which was a, that the mind consciousness cannot be, uh, taken by direct assault. We cannot imagine what we are inside my thinking about it alone. And, um, it can't, it hasn't been really dented very well by philosophy. I like to see that most of the philosophy which is a declining and highly endangered academic species, a incidentally a consist of failed models of how the brain works.

Speaker 1:          02:58          So students going into philosophy, shorter half to learn what they cart thought and then after a long while, while that's wrong, and what a schopenhauer might have thought and what might've thought or did sink, but they cannot go on from that position in historical examination of the nature of humanity to what it really is and how we might define it. So by default, the explanation of meaning of humanity falls to science and we are making progress if I might speak for science, uh, and it's from five disciplines and I will take just a moment to tell you what they are and then it'll make sense as to why not all of sciences whole by any means, which is developing exponentially and in the creation of knowledge faster and faster, uh, but from a particular set of disciplines within science, and I'm going to name them as I approached that.

Speaker 1:          04:09          And I'll say you cannot, you cannot get the answer from astrophysics. There are astrophysicists. Glad to try to explain to you a rhetorically in some way or other that what's the meaning of humanity is and what their studies of astrophysics tells us about the significance of humanity. Forget it. They can't possibly tell you, nor just astronomers, nor just chemists, nor just, um, well, my own colleagues, molecular biologists, they're too far removed from the subject to make any sensible thing about the meaning of human existence. Well, what are the disciplines? And if you look at these disciplines as I've done, and I've actually worked as a researcher, a in a couple, you have to know what the contributions are of evolutionary biology that is biology scene in a historical context going all the way back, millions of years to the origin of the human species. And then, uh, another one, uh, another science, of course, it's paleontology, which segues as we come closer to a modern humanity and the invention of agriculture and the birth of the Neolithic period turns into archaeology, archaeology, and paleontology which are on different timescales, is the other discipline, another second discipline, and a third of course.

Speaker 1:          05:48          And everybody would know about this now because it's progressing so rapidly in so many ways, is bringing science and then coming out of brain science or running parallel to it and trading with it. And depending upon it and deriving from it, uh, is we turned down to a more technology savvy. And that is a artificial intelligence. And with a artificial intelligence is the fifth robotics. Robotics is so important as Hollywood is now glommed onto knowing a good story when they see one robotics included, of course the notion of studying the mind in perfecting artificial intelligence and more than that, creating what the artificial intelligence and robotics people call whole brain emulation that is using robots as avatars and creating robots that are designed by design and imitation of what we know about the brain more and more like humans. All those five disciplines to get together, making bridges here and there are beginning to tell us what's the meaning of humanity is a product of a grand epic and it's a full story of humanity and we're just beginning to just draw it in clarity and a, let me just add to that why I'm leaving out.

Speaker 1:          07:34          History of the whole human species should kinetic as well as cultural. Uh, you have no chance whatsoever in defining the meaning of human existence because history that goes back essentially to the origin of literacy history makes no sense without prehistory. That is to say, uh, the biological evolution says lead up to the human condition as the beginning of history and prehistory in turn is a study of our ancestors going right back into the animal kingdom, makes no sense without biology. So we have to have a constant building, a concatenation of ideas and information, discipline to discipline across scales of the totality of the human population and scales of time going back actually millions of years to our early prehuman ancestors and then forward to the era of cultural evolution. And then we will have the story of humanity and then we will not ask in a quizzical manner what is the meaning of life? What is the meaning of human existence? We will have our answers.
