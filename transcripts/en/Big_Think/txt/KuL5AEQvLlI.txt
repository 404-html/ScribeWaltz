Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:11          I haven't made any public comment on it and I'm not going to start on this show. Everybody has a timeline of the time that you have to come to vote, but I think that it's likely to be decided before then and, uh, I, I probably will decide along with most others. I think Howard Dean was suggested at the end of June, if I'm not mistaken. Uh, I'm from Maine. I represented main in the Senate, but I'm now a resident of New York. Primarily I, when I left the Senate, I remarried. I had young children. My children go to school here. So you sort of, that's what you end up, uh, as a voting taxpaying citizen. Uh, uh, when Obama won the main caucus, I got a bunch of letters and calls from people because they. And I thought I'd be a, again, a superdelegate for me and I've been a sub delegate from Maine since I left the Senate.

Speaker 2:          01:16          And, uh, uh, they said, well, Obama won in Maine, so you should vote for Obama. Then a Clinton won in New York. Uh, uh, and I got a few calls from Clinton, people saying, well, you live in New York, you ought to vote for Clinton because she wanted New York. And then the Democratic National Committee announced, yes, in fact, I would be a adult soup delegate from New York. So then I started getting calls from my Obama friends making a completely different argument. And both sides argument have shifted over time. Uh, if you say a d, should you, should I vote in accordance with the majority in the state? That's New York. Then I would vote for Clinton. Should I vote for the majority in my congressional district? Should I vote for who wins the popular vote nationwide? Should that popular vote include or exclude Florida, which is likely to be a determining factor?

Speaker 2:          02:15          Who Wins? I mean, each of these has an argument in and of itself, but I guess my feeling is I feel much like I did in the Senate when I had to advise a consent on presidential nominations. The constitution doesn't define what you do. So I think I should use my best judgment taking into account and give, given great weight to the way others have voted. And there are, as I just mentioned, numerous iterations of that you can look at one of several factors, including the number of delegates they have, one through the elective process, but in the end, making a judgment which my conscience and judgment tells me is the person who will best serve the nation. And as a Democrat who will be most likely to be elected.

Speaker 2:          03:03          Uh, if I did, I wouldn't tell you because that would of course that defeat the purpose of any mediation. Uh, uh, and I don't. So I'm not giving any secrets from you. Uh, and I don't think it's likely to happen. I, I think it's all going to work out before then. I know you're not a reporter in the strictest sense, but you know, the press has an interest in controversy, keeping it going and devising scenarios that suggest a conflict right down to the last minute of the last hour of the last roll call at the convention and maybe beyond. But I think reality is to the contrary, I think it is likely to be resolved to not too long after the last primary or caucus. That's not very far away. We've waited this long. We can wait another week.
