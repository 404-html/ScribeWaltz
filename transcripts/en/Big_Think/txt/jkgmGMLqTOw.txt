Speaker 1:          00:19          They want you to buy in her life. My favorite example of this ridiculous, which is Nascar.

Speaker 2:          00:25          Here's this, you know, it's, it's somewhat legitimate because here's actual, an actual sport behind this brand. There's actually a product that people can get. It's new. It's, it's, it's got a lot of different angles to it, but NASCAR sales romance novels and ask ourselves packaged meats. Nascar is this massive lifestyle brand that wants to find all kinds of touch points to draw you further into the NASCAR lifestyle. Um, so from a consumer perspective, uh, you know, what brands do you like? How are they drawing you in so that you spend more of your money with them? Is it apple, you know, would you, would you buy an apple product even if it wasn't as good as something else? Is it a certain brand of clothing? I'm Thomas Pink makes, makes great shirts, but they also spray a certain linen scent into every one of their stores. Why? Why not just let the linen smell like linen? I mean, there's, there's certain marketing tactics these brands use to try and generate a feel sensory feel of psychological feel, a belonging and community and ritual and that that's, that that's for the consumer. It's that kind of sense of community that, that brands are after with lifestyle I'm pitches. Would that feel of being part of a community around a brand. Apple is another good example. Nascar, I mean these, these, these communities that bubble up around popular brands and they tried to capture that and then

Speaker 1:          02:02          BMW, Yoga, wear

Speaker 2:          02:03          for clothing or Cheetos, lip balm. But, but you know, this, this lifestyle stuff, it does begin to. It's corrosive to the, to the sense of where our communities are formed. Are Our communities formed around brands like apple now and Nascar? Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. You should. They, should, they are, they have, they kind of become more virtual and more online and brands are set up to kind of put tolls around those experiences. And also, you know, also true. I think, um, the, the, the, the damage to how we relate together as people and how we form relationships. And think of ourselves even in terms of our identity and our self esteem or aspirations.

Speaker 3:          02:45          It is largely influenced by marketing. Now more important than ever.
