Speaker 1:          00:13          I always felt forster was overrated frankly. Um, to take an obvious example. Never really got it. Uh, when people go on and on about Graham Greene, especially his important books like end of the affair, I get puzzled by. Shouldn't be. I mean there's nothing wrong with green and there's nothing wrong with forrester either. I just feel like what's all the fuss about? What is all the fuss about? Damned if I know frankly. Um, I think there is a, there are, there must be American writers. Well Dave Wallace I think is one of them and probably George Saunders is another who I don't think the Brits get it all. I think they're just like, why do people or why this is so. This is so purell oil. It's so easy. It's like I don't know what they're thinking or this is so bratty. It's so annoying. Or it's so broad or whatever they're saying. I think there's a category of American fiction that just doesn't cross the ocean so well. And I think that I'm talking about a strain of British fiction writing a not inconsiderable strain of British fiction writing that I don't that some people

Speaker 1:          01:39          to some people, this is what a novel is. It's an enforced or novel or a Graham Greene novel. They're living practitioners in England producing novels that also today seem like, well, this is what a real novelist is and this is what a real novel is. Um, and for some of us in America, you're just like say that's not even a novelist hardly. That's sort of a, it's, it's an, it's an a near perfect replica of a novel. It's, um, so it's a taste thing. Uh, I think there's a kind of well made product that, that forster pioneered and represents, um, that engendered a great many very well made novels in England in the 20th century that either think is like what an novel should be, or else you just throw up your hand.
