Speaker 1:          00:08          I was raised in western Massachusetts, I am the child of two southerners and my brother is also southern and my family is southern way back before the mayflower. So I was the only Yankee in the family for all generations. And it, um, it definitely shaped me and my taste. I was the only little Yankee boy who liked boiled peanuts and puts a salted peanuts in his coke and I'm liked grits for breakfast.

Speaker 2:          00:47          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:47          Well, southerners I think have, um, a number of traditions, one of which is a storytelling. So, um, my southern relations when we get together, I mean it's just one story after another, after another, after another Thanksgiving when I go down to visit my uncle Bob and aunt render and all the cousins are there. My stomach will hurt for days afterward because it's just so funny and they're all great storytellers and that's kind of how a family knowledge is passed on from generation to generation is through stories. Um, you know, I mean, it's a cliche, but, um, there's a certain level of dysfunction I suppose that goes along with being part of a southern family secrets. And, and, and all these entanglements and there's a, uh, there's a sort of gentility a courtesy. I mean, I was very polite as a child. I'm very well mannered as a child and um, that's something else that you find

Speaker 1:          02:03          probably it all started with the, with the astors, you know, in the vanderbilts in New York City in the gilded age when society was constructed of layers upon layers upon layers of etiquette. I mean, you, you didn't call somebody on the phone or you didn't text them and say, let's go grab lunch. You would have your, Your Person Send Your handwritten note over by carriage to your acquaintances or your friend's house. And they would receive the note and respond in kind. And they were just very, um, many layers to society and how we behaved and how we reacted appropriately. Now because New York is an, always has been sort of the, uh, the design geist from which, you know, everything radiates out. This is sort of the taste center and the design center of America. Um, and certainly was back then, I think a lot of people emulated a, that stratified sort of concept of society and um, Chicago certainly did, you know, the big families began behaving as New Yorkers did and then as, as society spread west and happened in the west coast as well and down south.

Speaker 1:          03:18          And it's interesting because, um, these, these manners, you know, a lot of them became of course outdated over time. Life became more casual, you know, casual Friday took over. But in the south, what you find is that these, um, these manners still remain. Um, last Thanksgiving I was driving down a dirt road in Alabama. Is that a red clay road? Very Narrow d dog, Alabama, you know, where there are alligators in the backyard and this big pickup truck, like in Ford, f three, five was approaching me. And um, so it was me and my boyfriend and our two French bulldogs. And I'm thinking, okay, this is the part where the good old boy pulls the fags over, shoots him and takes the dogs. And so as this truck gets closer and closer, it's got the big headlights, you know, on the top, I see the driver is wearing camouflage, including a camouflage hat. So I'm thinking, well, this is it. We're going to die. And just as we passed the trucker goes like this and moves on. And I realized at that moment it was an epiphany and I realized the last gentleman, these are the last true gentlemen, are the southern good old boys because their mamas taught them to behave, you know? Yes ma'am. Thank you ma'am. No Sir. Thank you sir. And that's pretty much how it is in the shelf. And that's why I love the south. I love, I love this APP.

Speaker 1:          05:01          I don't think I've inherited the um, you know, the gothic literary sensibility sort of almost dated to Eudora welty and flannery o'connor. It's a, it's a south that doesn't quite exist as it did. Certainly there are pockets, um, but because I didn't live in the south, I didn't experience, you know, the Spanish moss hanging off the trees and the sort of sweltering day days in that sort of drowsy, you know. And the sort of sweet tea and um, I have a deep appreciation for it. I mean, one of my favorite authors is um, Carson mccullers and I think I'm, the member of the wedding is just one of the most perfect books ever written. Um, and it really for me, captures that flavor. I don't know if you would call it a gothic southern novel, but it certainly captures that dee dee just sort of almost the central south and melancholy quality. So I myself don't think of myself as a southern writer, although there are certain things about me that are definitely a bitter definitely southern that are there as a result of, um, you know, having southern parents and having southern relatives.
