Speaker 1:          00:04          Who would I like to interview? Um, well, I actually would like to interview some of the leaders in developing countries, uh, like in South Africa for example, uh, as one, but that's just one of a few and try to get them to articulate to me why they are not doing certain things in their country that everyone else seems to appreciate from the outside that they should be doing. Why are they not paying much more attention to some of the, the suffering of the people in their own country now? They may have a very good reason for it, but I'd like to pose the tough questions to them as to why they aren't doing that.
