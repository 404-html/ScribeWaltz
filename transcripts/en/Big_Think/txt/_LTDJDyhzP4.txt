Speaker 1:          00:03          My favorite really is a nonprofit. I had a young woman come to me,

Speaker 2:          00:08          I guess it's three years ago, and she came in my office and sat down and take my entrepreneurship courses and she said, you know, in New York City public schools, there are 300 schools that are elementary that do not have playgrounds for children. I'm going to fix that. And they just sat there and kind of nodded and said, that's interesting how you're going to do that. And she said, I don't know, but I'm going to do it. Did you spent a year studying it, going around and taking pictures, building a case that this was something that really children should have. Three years later, that young lady has raised over $10 million. She's already completed 20 playgrounds in New York City, has 20 some more in the pipeline under construction. So I look at somebody like that and she has the skill to new or anything she wants, but I just am overwhelmed with the fact that she could go out there and do it just with that spirit. And I celebrate her every time I see her. Uh, we also have a company that we launched called Recycle Bank, which is a, a company that's done just phenomenally well. And it came out of our program and I worked very closely with that student, a Ron Gonan, and it's built into something very special. You know, there were awarding people for recycling, and it's a rewards program and they're having a dramatic effect in the cities that they're entering. And I see a lot of growth.

Speaker 1:          01:18          We just have endless numbers of these wonderful young people. And I get up every day just a Sullivan [inaudible].
