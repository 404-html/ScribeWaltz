Speaker 1:          00:03          It was alleged that the newspapers were not aware of the large percentage of the population of American citizens were unhappy with the ruling establishment, did not feel their voices are being heard, and they voted against what everybody thought was was the leading candidate and instead voted for this rank outsider, a very unpredictable and generally unpopular person. Because businessman this egotist, this rakish character named Donald Trump. I thought what was missing from the newspapers, and I think more than that from Americans in general, who watched television, who read books to teach in universities who are among the educated classes, which go almost includes everybody these days. The reason I say that in my lifetime, born in 1932 and becoming a journalist in the 19 fifties and at the time I became a journalist, the 19 fifties we journalists, whether it worked for the New York Times and the Philadelphia Inquirer or the Chicago Tribune, where generally the first of our family to have gone to college.

Speaker 1:          01:21          And when I say college, I do not mean Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford. I mean Brooklyn College or in my case, the University of Alabama. We were not going to the elite colleges. If we went to college at all, it was we were considered scholars in our family, but what we were, what we were not true today, but what we in the Mid Twentieth Century America, we were outsiders. We journalists were of the outsider class, whether we were Italian heritage is me or Jewish or African American or Spanish, whatever, and we saw through the outside looking in with our nose pressed against the glass. We looked inside at power and privilege at maneuverings within the political system, at a poc, cracy, at outright deceit. We saw all this and sometimes if we had courage, we wrote about and we did have courage because most of us had come from parents or grandparents who had knew, who had firsthand knowledge, persecution and foreign countries who came to this country on the run and brought with them the spirit of unfairness and we as the inheritors of their spirit when journalism.

Speaker 1:          02:42          We were the children of those period of those people. We brought not cynicism, but skepticism of power and it was never our ambition to be part of power because we were chroniclers of power. We were critics of power. We were viewers of power. We were outsiders. Well, those days are long, long, long gone. Well, we have now 50 years beyond what I'm talking about, the group of journalists who go to the same elite schools as the most privileged people have power. Obama was a college professor, Harvard Man, and he was teaching while a president for the two terms essentially teaching class to the higher classes, including the journalism of his time. Now you have this ranking foul mouth guy with his oldest awful blonde hair becoming elected and the people in general. Oh God, it's so embarrassing. It's like they were so stunned is like having a.

Speaker 1:          03:55          their. Their world is shattered and have why you're so shattered. Why are you so stupid? Don't you realize that you join you. Journalists are so blind. You don't know as journalist anything except being educated from the time you're. You're privileged little kids. I mean, even poor people, black people, Hispanic, still want to be like the privileged white people and what I'm getting at, and her long winded way is the way journalists have failed, were failed profession. The pride that my generation took, being strong as a force against the powers of prerogative, powers of privilege doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't exist anywhere. The journalist now want to be part of the power game. They wanted to get on Air Force One. They want to join trump at 21. They want to have that dinner. 20 one with the. They want to be clustered in Washington, which is the most decadent city.

Speaker 1:          04:51          It's the most evil empire. If I were running Washington, boy do I sometimes have grandiose ideas in the middle of the night, if I was already what I would get half of those reporters out of Washington, break up the Washington press corps, send them all over to the state capitals. We have 50 states, put two reporters in every state instead of covering congress or the cabinet or whatever. Let the people who are from these states report the mood of the state's report. The feelings, the findings, the personalities that are in parts of America that are not and in the main main street and main light, and we tell our story not for the power brokers that are clustered Washington, those privilege power and generally rich people, but we're tell something about the results of law, the results of privilege, the results of ignorance, the results of, of, of bad decisions and war would cover. Injured. Soldiers would cover the life of, of farmers, would cover a grease mechanic and a guy that's some redneck sheriff somewhere. And if we knew the America that way, we would not be surprised by such an election as we had and the aftermath of Obama's eight years.
