Speaker 1:          00:05          Nobody doesn't love you. Let me back up. When we think of places you might find life, we typically think of the goldilocks zone around a star where water would be liquid in its natural state. And if you get a little too close to the star, heat would evaporate the water and you don't have it anymore. It's gone. Too far away would freeze. And neither of those states of h two o or are useful to life as we know it. We need liquid water. So you can establish this green zone, this habitable zone, this goldilocks zone, where if you find a planet orbiting there, hey, it's a good chance it could have liquid water. Let's look there first for life as we know it. Now it turns out that the source of heat of course, is traceable to the sun. And if you go farther out, everything would or should be frozen.

Speaker 1:          01:03          All other things being equal. But you're Ropa a moon of Jupiter sitting well outside of the goldilocks zone is kept warm, not from energy sources traceable to the sun, but from what we call the tidal forces of Jupiter itself. So Jupiter and surrounding moons are actually pumping energy into Europa. And how did you do that? As you rope it orbits Jupiter, it's shape changes. It's not fundamentally different from tides rising and falling on earth. The shape of the water system of the earth is responding to tidal forces of the mood. And when you do that to a solid object, the solid object is, is stressing. And because of this, a consequence of this is that you're pumping energy into the object. It is no different from when you say anyone who's familiar with racket sports, indoor racket, sports, you could be a racket ball or squash.

Speaker 1:          02:10          You say, let's warm up the ball before we start playing. You want to hit it around a few times. You are literally warming up the ball. It's not just simply let's get loose. You are literally warming up the ball. How you are distorting it every time you smack it and then the resilience of the ball pops it back into shape. And every time you do that, every smack your pumping energy into the ball is not fundamentally different from what's going on in orbit around Jupiter. So you have this frozen world Europa completely frozen on its surface, but you look at, you look at the surface and there cracks in the ice, there, ridges in the ice where there's a crack and it's shifted. And then refroze. So this Ridge has discontinuity in the crack and then continues in another place. So what this tells you is that Europa cannot be completely frozen because if it were, nothing would be moving.

Speaker 1:          03:13          You look at the surface of Europa, the frozen surface, they're like ice chunks that are like shifted and refrozen and shifted again. It looks just like if you fly over, uh, the, the, the Arctic ocean fly over the Arctic Ocean in the winter. These are ice sheets that are breaking and refreezing all the time. It's the same signature as that. So all of us are convinced that beneath this icy surface is an ocean of liquid water. And there's no reason to think it wouldn't have been liquid for billions of years on earth where we find liquid water, we find life.

Speaker 2:          03:54          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Wherever we find liquid water, we find life even places like the Dead Sea. Why did anybody call it a Dead Sea? Because the microscope hadn't yet been invented. And sure of the, maybe there's no macroscopic vertebrate fishes, but microbes

Speaker 1:          04:17          have no problems thriving in practically any conditions under which you would find liquid water. So what this means is not only do we have a source of heat outside of the goldilocks zone, we have conditions under which life could be thriving. And knowing that this is possible has completely broaden the net that we are casting in search for life in the universe. No longer is it that, let me, let's find a 72 degree title pond and see life forming there. No life is pretty hardy and yeah, if it takes liquid water, we, that may be the other place in the solar system that is teaming with some form or another of life. So yeah, we all want to go to your roper period. Can we got to go ice fishing though? Cause you've got to cut a hole or melt a hole. You got to get there somehow because this sheet of ice by some estimates are several kilometers thick.

Speaker 1:          05:21          And so it'll take some effort to get through that, which we haven't really fully figured out yet. But it's an engineering problem, not a science problem. So clever engineers should be able to figure that one out. And by the way, you rope is not the only one of these moons in the outer solar system that's kept warm by the sort of title stress forces. There are other moons that feel the same influx of energy. So for example, io, that's the innermost moon of Jupiter that suffers from this phenomenon even more at that moon is so hot. There are volcanoes erupting from within. There it is, it is rendered Multan whatever solid parts of that moon there are. And so in fact, the most volcanically active place in the solar system is io, one of the moons of Jupiter. And we don't know how to sustain life under temperatures that hot. So, but it's a reminder that if you're looking for sources of energy, we no longer need to be anchored to a host star in our search for life in the universe.
