Speaker 1:          00:03          The question of leadership is really interesting because, uh, for, for, for most businesses really at this point, the loss of control they fear is already in the past, right? That, that there was, there was a media environment in which almost any message about ibm that was in the public was created by IBM and then circulated via press release or reported by a newspaper or what have you. Uh, and then of course there was a, you know, word of mouth chatter on the street kinds of stuff, but that all operated at a level so much smaller than anything a large company can produce. Uh, the biggest change in leadership I think is that those days are over. And uh, there's the range of choices leaders have about the perception of their company a has been quite, quite restricted, uh, because the counter story will always get at as well.

Speaker 1:          01:09          And it's just, it's just much more of a dialogue in the public. So, so the two great visions of, of leadership we have, right, the grand visionary or the micromanager, uh, now seem to meet not to work as well. Uh, the, the, the Internet is kind of compressed, the range and leadership has become instead a combination of a, infusing a company with whatever the core, the core imperatives are, and making sure that the company doesn't overbalance too far in one direction or another. So Amazon, to take just one example, Amazon has my favorite corporate award ever in the history of corporate awards. They have an award that you can only win as an employee if you do something great and you didn't ask permission first, right? In other words, you can get if you ask permission, if you clear things with your bosses, but if you do something really good and you just saw that it was a possibility and you did it, you've got a special word for not having asked permission. And that's an example of something that to your friend, your earlier point about your friend lowers the amount of internal communication required and also sets a cultural norm for the business that no amount of memos and mission statements could Sibley send. And that kind of leadership. What, what, what, what visa does. I think in terms of creating a cultural climate where good ideas are rewarded matters so much more than, you know, either grand visioning or a micromanager in this, in this environment.
