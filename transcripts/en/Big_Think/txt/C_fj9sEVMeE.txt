Speaker 1:          00:04          So a few years ago I went to go and investigate rumors of hippos, rogue hippos running riot it, rural Columbia. Now, hippos don't naturally live in South America. They are from sub Saharan Africa and, but these hippos had been transported to Columbia by Pablo Escobar. So Pablo Escobar, like many powerful men, fancied himself as a bit of a, a Noah's Ark, a kind of twisted, no, in fact, and he wanted to build his own menagerie at a Hacienda Napoli's, which was his ranch where he controlled his drug empire in between a Bogota metagene in the, uh, in the Andes, in Colombia. And legend has it that he gathered together this menagerie by stealing a Russian cargo plane, flying it, or having it flown to Africa where he loaded it up with loads of illegal wildlife and it had to get it back to Columbia before the tranquilizer animals woke up. Um, and uh, amongst this cargo of creatures was a one male hippo that was nicknamed Lva, Ho and three females.

Speaker 1:          01:24          And he transplanted these enormous piece into a pond at his Hacienda. And they loved it. It turns out that Columbia is a hippo paradise because actually all hippos really want is some nice shallow water to wallow around in and plenty of grass to eat. And Columbia has plenty of that and it also has no other hippos, so no other competition and no natural predators. So the hippos flourished, uh, in their, in their new paradise. And very quickly the four became eight, became 12, became 16. And what happens with hippos is you have a male who has a heart team. So every time one of Lva, hose sons reach sexual maturity, he would boot him out of the pond and that a young male hippo would then head off in search of hippo love elsewhere. Now, of course in Africa, this is completely normal. Hippos head off from there, their family group and young males will go in search of hippo love, uh, and uh, and, and, and start their own family.

Speaker 1:          02:38          But of course in Columbia there are no hippos out there. So these males, these young males are being spirited away from Hacienda Napoli's in one of the many, many rivers in that part of Columbia, which acts like sort of hippo superhighway. So they're sort of pinging them out into the countryside and they arrive and they can't find a mate. So they, they quite cantankerous piece the best of times. But these are sorts of front frustrated, hoardy male hippos, desperately looking for love where there is none. Um, I, I went to Columbia to investigate this story and visited one of these rogue males that had installed himself in a pond next to a kindergarten. Uh, I've met the kids from the school who told me that they no longer liked to bathe in that particular pond to right. And one of them told me about how his grandmother had been chased by the, uh, love lawn beast for quite some time, the earlier in the week.

Speaker 1:          03:47          Um, so they, they are, they, they're kind of running a mock basically. So, you know, what do you do with this situation? You've got, you know, rapidly multiplying hippos. And the extraordinary thing about what's happening in Columbia is it's changing their behavior because in Africa you have this very fierce dry season, which, you know, puts the brakes on hippo reproduction. So I think they, they reach sexual maturity, you know, I don't know, I can't remember. It's like, Eh, at five or seven years, let's say. But in Colombia they were reaching sexual maturity significantly earlier and having babies every year instead of every two years. So they were multiplying at this much faster rate because they didn't have the same constraints on them that they do in Africa. So you've got a bit of a problem. You've got a massive invasive species now with most invasive species, the solution is to get rid of them because basically they upset ecosystems and, and so they need to be removed.

Speaker 1:          04:55          And the problem with hippos though is that they store in Disney movies. So there is this sort of rogue male, uh, and the first one that they, they, uh, they put down, it was a public outcry. And so they had to come up with a different plan. And I met with the Colombian vet who was in charge of implementing the radical plan B, which was the castration program. So Carlos Valderrama was given the onerous task of having to cast straight one of these rogue males. Now this I'm sure you can appreciate as a job that takes a fair amount of coneys because castrating a wild male, hippo is no easy task. It is actually unbelievably complicated. First of all, I'm hippos because they've got so much fat, they're really hard to anesthetize because the anesthetic dissolves in the fat. So even though they're enormous, you have to get the dosage right.

Speaker 1:          06:05          They also, when they're nervous, they go into water, you don't want it to pass out in the water because it's going to drown. Then when you finally managed to a nice, it's Carlos sits, me had. And also they really, really, really aggressive. And then Carlos told me that he had decoys, cowboys and, and all sorts of shenanigans to try and just to get through the anesthetics stage. Then the clock was on. They had a certain amount of time in order to complete the, uh, the castration. Now, the thing about hippos is they are the closest relative of the hippo is the whale. They have internal testicles that are buried underneath about eight inches of skin and fat. Not only that, but hippo testicles have a habit of wandering about when under threat they can move as much as eight centimeters. So you're looking at a blank canvas behind which there is a moving target.

Speaker 1:          07:02          Now, when you get in there, they're the size of cantaloupes, but just getting to them and working out where to make the incision and then managing to grab hold of these moving melons and getting them out was quite some task and it's apparently it took him about six hours and uh, it cost well over $100,000. So, you know, I think they've managed to do one more. I subsequently, but they're never going to. It's just, it's too difficult. They're never going to be able to castrate all the males. That's just not going to happen. What I think's going to happen is we're going to have a, a new subspecies of Colombian hippo before too long hippopotamus Escobar, Chris, um, because that's how you make a new species you take, you put it in isolation from its parent species and, and it evolves into a slightly different, different species.

Speaker 1:          08:00          And that's what's going to happen. The hippo is always being quoted as being Africa's most dangerous animal. Now I, I did some digging around and I've never really been able to find out the source of this fact, but I can tell you, having been charged by a hippo myself, they are really, really, really dangerous. I mean, they, they do kill people. They are extremely aggressive. They move really fast. The, uh, the mail that we went to go and film the rogue male in Columbia, he, uh, we got a little bit too close and he was in his pond and he came towards us with such velocity that they were barrel waves coming off his, uh, coming off as nosy hurtled through the water. Uh, it was pretty terrifying. I can tell you. So the thing about hippos is they are there, they're really dangerous. So they're dangerous to humans in Columbia who don't understand how dangerous they are because culturally they haven't grown up alongside hippos.

Speaker 1:          08:57          I've seen them in Disney films. They think they're chubby and cute. Carlos told me that this is, this is a real issue, but also of course they all ecosystem engineers. One of the things about hippos is that they, you know, they're big animals, they churn up a lot of vegetation. They have the power to reshape their environment and it's this reshaping of the environment that was. That was most alarming to cow call style drama because he was worried that other native species that share the rivers, like manatees for instance, we would suffer with hippos being around.
