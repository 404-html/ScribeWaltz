Speaker 1:          00:09          It means a lot. It definitely means a lot. Um, because I think there were so many people

Speaker 1:          00:25          who doubted that it would actually happen. There are so many people who said get, that's cool, but it's not going to happen or he's gonna get assassinated. Or, I mean, I was watching the Nike Aeration and watching him getting sworn in. I was like, as there's going to be the shot now, like I was so scared. And so it meant so much, I think to our generation and I'm coining our generation generation. Why not? Because I think that he exemplified all the possibilities of what you can do if you just believe and try hard enough. He is the most relevant. How ratio augers story that we have had in this country in a long time. And you know, for young people, especially young people of color, who didn't think that that was possible, that meant a lot. And I think that that motivated so many of us, and there's a series of events that have motivated our generation to be one of the greatest generations since the great depression generation. I like one of those was hurricane Katrina, one of those was having a Dick in the Office for eight years who hung out with a Bush. Um, and then

Speaker 1:          01:43          after that it was getting to that point of so much frustration that the audacity that we actually had the audacity to go outside of our box and elect a young African American president. And that is what's redefining our generation. And not only just the economic situation, but I think that we were so complacent during Bush's term. We were so overwhelmed by how ridiculous it was that we didn't feel like we can do anything about it. And Obama's when shows that we can, if we put our minds to it. And I think that's what it meant to me the most, is that it was very motivating of my own personal.
