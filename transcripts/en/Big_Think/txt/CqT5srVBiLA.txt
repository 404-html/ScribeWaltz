Speaker 1:          00:10          Well, it's, it's, it's difficult to disentangle, but you can, you can think about it, think about it this way. Two ways. One is there's almost nothing done in Washington d C or on the campaign trail without the media involved, uh, so that the media is constantly on the mind of every politician and policymaker. The second way to think about it is that the media both reflects and shapes any policy debate. So in some, some cases that the framing, the presentation, uh, of, of an issue with in the news, uh, reflects how strategists are pushing certain packages or a strategic interpretations into the media coverage or the nature of the debate that's going on in Congress. At other times, something will appear in the media around a focusing event, say a natural disaster or a new scientific moment or a will come up with a new interpretation.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Sometimes journalists are kind of issue entrepreneurs onto themselves. They're actually pushing, um, a certain direction or a new re-interpretation on policies. And Your Times magazine article is a good example. Um, and so in some cases the media can then start a new narrative in the policy debate, a new frame. Um, but really you can think about controlling media, uh, everything that goes on in an election, everything that goes on in Washington DC. Fundamentally it comes down to first controlling an attention, how much attention in issue receives in the press and then when it does receive attention, how's it defined or how is it framed?

Speaker 1:          01:43          Well, I think, I think the biggest challenge facing science institutions today is the problem of choice in the media system. Uh, so you can pray, you can produce great scientific content and produce really great science media coverage of the New York Times coverage on pbs. But in most parts in those outlets, you're probably only reaching an audience who already agrees with you and is already well informed. The rest of the American public, they have so many media choices that if they lack of preference or interest in science content, they can completely avoid that really good coverage. So the challenge then is to try to figure out, in fact, ways to what I call incidentally, expose that wider public, the science content to get them science information and places in the media where they're not looking for it. So sometimes that's in celebrity news coverage. Uh, sometimes that that's at a religious new site.

Speaker 1:          02:36          Sometimes that's in late night comedy, like the daily show, um, infotainment entertainment, sometimes that's on the business beat because many people that read the business pages are not interested in science or not also recent reading the science, uh, pages. Uh, but if you can get coverage of science, the business beat, now you're reaching an important audience. Um, so you have to figure out a way that, uh, where can you accidentally reach your audience, incidentally reached the intended audience that you're trying to reach. And then second, that's the channel. And then you have to figure out, okay, what's the message that fits with that channel, with that area of the media and also the audience that's consuming that media. Uh, and again, that's where you, that's where you do the research, uh, on how to frame a present that complex information in a way that's understandable, assessable and connects to something that people already know. Right.
