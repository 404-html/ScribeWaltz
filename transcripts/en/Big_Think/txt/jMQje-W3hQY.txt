Speaker 1:          00:12          It's a loaded question with me actually because, um, I'm, I'm from Iran. Originally. I was born there, um, and the first several years of my life we lived there and the plan was to stay there. Of course, this omic revolution, uh, last up. And so, uh, we moved to Los Angeles. I was raised in Los Angeles, but my formative years were actually spent in New York from 18 onwards. So I have a sort of ultra hyphenated identity, I guess is Iranian American and um, Los Angeleno and New Yorker by coastal, by cultural, well, at the time of the hostage crisis, they were still in Iran. Um, and they, because my, my mother and my father were both educated, um, abroad to a degree. They, you know, when they got to the u s they spoke English, they were able to, um, work here. Um, it wasn't horrible. Um, but for them, a lot of the fear came in just getting out of Iran.

Speaker 1:          01:22          You know, the airports were shut down when they tried to, to get out because of the Iran, Iraq war. And, um, you know, they were basically sort of Gypsies through much of Europe. You know, they were in Turkey than they were. That's from there. They went to France to Germany, you know, and then they've just finally went to Los Angeles by default because that's what all the Iranians were doing. Um, but it wasn't so bad for them. And I imagine it wasn't so bad for a lot of Iranians because they all thoughts was temporary. You know, they didn't even, they only had two suitcases with them. Um, so, and, and all their stuff is still and in house they own any Iran to this day that's left pretty much untouched. Everything as it was when they fled. Because when, when they talk, people talk about Iranians flaying maybe they really did flee. Um, some of them made the decision quite rapidly for some of, for some people like my family, it was an almost overnight a decision because it really never seemed like it would be permanent. Um, that's a very tricky question as well. Um, I, as I get older, I tend to become more Iranian. Um, but I guess I've, I've now, since the novel came out, been forced to consider myself as an Iranian American more and more so my family is fairly traditional Iranian family. Um, but the novel really split me into, um, made me sort of consider being a California and, and a New Yorker. So in some ways I emerged more confused.
