Speaker 1:          00:05          Well, I mean, I guess the hard lines, secularism is not a good idea. Uh, which is not to say that secularism is not a good idea. I mean, I, I've, I certainly think that the attempt in the United States to buy groups here to rewrite American history as a sort of Christian story and to portray the founding fathers as, as, um, Christian fathers is something that really needs to be challenged. And, and in the name of, of secular in the name of history, but accurate history as well as everything else. But I think the kind of hard, no secularism of France that kind of, um, unbending insistence on, um, that secular means one thing and that violations of it are, will not be tolerated in any way is a bad idea. Um, and that if you're accommodating, um, different groups, different populations, um, what you need to do is figure out ways of accommodating them.

Speaker 1:          01:13          The way the French did when they passed the 1905 loss separating church and state the way they did with the Catholic church. There was a day off for religious instruction for kids. All the holidays in France still, or some are state holidays, but most of them are Catholic, not even just Christian Catholic holidays. Um, parts of France are Alsace. And Lorraine Alsace Moselle those departments which were, um, under German control when the 1905 law was passed and then came back to France after the war. Those con, those areas were never forced to adopt the secular practices that the rest of the country, uh, adopted. So still in those areas, you can have religious teaching in schools, children have to take a course in religious instruction and so on and so forth. So if they're not even consistent, it's not even a nationally consistent policy in relation to Catholicism, which was the dominant religion at the time the law was passed.

Speaker 1:          02:16          So to act as if it's either secularism or nothing, or that the secular and the religious are in eternal opposition to each other is to misrepresent French history and to create a situation in which they will only be a greater sense of, um, felt discrimination and, um, anger on the part of the population's whom these these laws affect. Uh, so, uh, it seems to me that that kind of hard lines, secularism, which is as fundamentalist in its way as the most extreme Islam Islamist fundamentalism is defeats its own purpose and really doesn't, um, ended up producing a situation in which there can be a certain kind of pluralism, cultural pluralism and political assimilation and political citizenship.
