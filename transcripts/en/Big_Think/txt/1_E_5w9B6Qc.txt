Speaker 1:          00:08          Yeah, well, the today, the two you just mentioned are two that reasons I'm cooking really. I mean, uh, uh, Eliot Coleman as a farmer in the northeastern part of Maine that I was frustrated with this shortness of the growing season. And He, um, uh, well he tells a story, it's great storyteller, but he tells a story about how he was thinking of moving to France or to Italy. And he was looking at a map and he saw that his farm is on the same latitude as, um, northern Italy and southern France provence. And, um, he knew that, um, uh, there were vegetables, uh, that were, uh, daylight determined not temperature determinant. So if you could keep it above 32 degrees, you could grow everything that you grow in northern Italy and southern France in the middle of the winter. You could do that in me. And as long as you can control the temperature and not have it dip to 32 degrees.

Speaker 1:          01:02          So he invented these, these, these really revolutionary, uh, uh, greenhouses, so sort of hoop houses that prevented ice crystallization and the planet and, and got his farm going in ways that very few people I've been able to do. And now he's been mimicked all around the world really. Um, so he was an inspiration for me because in college when I was cooking for him on this, I was thinking, you know, Blue Hill farm was a great asset to, it's, it's, it's 300 acres of pasture land and part of the problem with farming and the northeast of course, is the weight. What do you do from, from December to May. Uh, and most of these farmers have other jobs during this time and, and, and it's a very sort of, uh, a low revenue stream time. So, so what elliot invented, or what Elliot took advantage of was something that very few farmers had thought about.

Speaker 1:          01:52          Uh, and he did it by making money doing it, which is the key. So he was a huge influence in me and my thinking that, you know, ultimately if I got good enough and, and, and could be, uh, uh, Neil can make a career of cooking, you know, Blue Hill would be an asset for, for a supply chain. And then there's Joel Salitan who did everything and I'm just talking about really on the animal. And it took advantage of this landscape in ways that other farmers hadn't by, um, by raising different species of animals in the same space. And so both of these men informed me greatly and then ultimately stone barns great late because we've kind of mimicked each of their operations at stone barns, made it our own for Westchester County, but they're, their basic philosophy, uh, is,

Speaker 2:          02:35          is all over the place. It's humbling.

Speaker 1:          02:42          Well, we have this 23,000 square foot greenhouse, for example, on the Elliot side, right? So, uh, that's Eliot Coleman writ large and it's, um, and it's, uh, made for him. It was built for, uh, uh, uh, you know, based on, on Westchester County, which is to say, uh, that the taxes, the, the Labor that's a necessary for this part of the country versus where Elliot is. So it needed to be quite a bit larger than what Elliot does. Uh, but the underpinnings of what he wrote so outright, what he writes so eloquently about talks about going about is, is a strong soil, uh, and, uh, planting, uh, vegetables, uh, that, uh, take advantage of our natural, um, uh, you know, our natural ecology. So for example, you know, we now, I just harvested last week, um, we just harvested the farm, just harvested, um, carrots from both the greenhouse and the field, and they're the best carrots of the year.

Speaker 1:          03:47          And so what, what people generally talk about the northeast as I was saying before, is, you know, it's, it's dead during the winter, right? But in fact, for certain vegetables like root vegetables, carrots, and parsnips and Rutabaga and, and, and celery root, um, if you are willing to use hoop houses or use something that, that can prevent the temperature from falling below 32 degrees, you can actually have vegetables that are better than any place in the country because the starches through the coal, through the freezing turn to sugars, uh, with these phrases. So, um, you know, we took a bricks test of this carrot. Now I, this particular card, I went on the Internet and I found the bricks test is, uh, the parts per billion of sugar in the, in the vegetable, right? So we squeezed a little bit of carrot juice on and took a reading and I looked on the internet and they said the highest reading for this type of care, it was 14.6.

Speaker 1:          04:39          It took, uh, took, uh, uh, thought of it and read it. And it was 15.8 literally off the charts. Right? And so I was speaking to a plant scientist who happens also to be a poet. And I think he described it. That's what's going on. He said that when a vegetable gets through a root vegetable or actually other vegetables like Kale and Swiss chard and uh, and um, uh, Brussel sprouts, but in this case and dead of winter when these root vegetables and they're in the ground, feel the freeze coming, they convert the starches to sugars to try and raise their body temperature about like making ice cream to vent ice crystallization. They're raising their body temperatures, like the ice crystallization means death. So he said, I think poetically, uh, you know, what you're tasting is sweetness and what the plant is telling you is I don't want to die.

Speaker 1:          05:31          It's really interesting. So it's taking advantage, I mean this is sort of Elliot and Joel's in any of these sustainable agriculture minded individuals is taking advantage of your natural ecology to produce delicious and by definition, healthful food. That's a low impact on your environment. So that's, that's there. And then on the, on the animal side of things, um, one of the great benefits of being in this New England areas, grass is grassland. So, uh, you know, our goal and the goal of the farmers that, that practice, the animal husbandry at stone barns is to, is to, to take advantage to keep their eye on the sunlight and have the sunlight feed the grass and have the grasp of the animals and the animals feed us, you know, so that the minimum amount of, of grain inputs that we can take from other farms outside of stone barns and use what's in our own natural ecology. It's what provides not only, you know, the most sustainable meats, but also the most delicious because the, the grass is this buffet of different flavors and, and nutrients and, uh, and it adds subtleties and the flavor of the meat that you can't find elsewhere. So those are two examples of many that take advantage of our natural ecology and, uh, and produced better tasting food.

Speaker 2:          06:53          Okay.
