Speaker 1:          00:00          So I got pulled into economics in 2007 because of the 2008 economic crisis. Mike Brown, who had been the first cfo of Microsoft, chief financial officer of Microsoft and treasure of Microsoft. He came to Toronto in 2007. It took my wife and I out to dinner and said he's trying to put together a research group to work on economics and he would like me to be involved. And I said, I don't know anything about economics. He said, that's okay because nobody does and the whole system is about to collapse. He said the the balance sheets of all the big investment banks, it's like they have cancer. They're full of holes. And I remember being very struck by this because this is before anybody was talking about this and so I started to meet with a group of people that he was pulling together to understand what was going to happen and to understand if there was any way to save the situation.

Speaker 1:          00:56          It was a very ambitious thing and of course we failed. But along the way, I was motivated as a kind of public service to get interested in economics and what I found economics in a way it's very easy for a physicist to understand because it's very mathematical and the mathematical models that they use a very clean. They're based on assumptions, hypotheses, and you can study them. And then as I started it, I began to understand some for myself and more from just reading around because the false with the standard economic models with the standard models of finance are well known. There had been in the literature for decades and decades. So let me give some examples. The Standard Model of economics is called the neoclassical model and assumes that markets are systems where it's trading happens between consumers and firms. And there's certain simple models of how that goes on and the ideas that these come to equilibrium equilibrium.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Not In the physical sense, but especially economic sense in which you reach a point at which the prices are fixed, such that market forces fix the prices such that you maximize the happiness of the consumers and maximize the profits of the firms. And in so-called equilibrium, nobody can become happier or more profitable without somebody else becoming less happier, less profitable, and the ideology behind this, not behind the mathematics, because mathematics doesn't have an ideology, but behind the arguments that were made and still are made from this model is that mark has don't need regulation because they have these natural equilibrium where everybody benefits to the maximum possible. And if you're in equilibrium, you can't do better. Now there's a fault with this, and it's an obvious follow has been known since the 19 seventies from some theorems approved by some economists including, um, some of the founders of this field of mathematical economics, which is, that does not one equilibrium.

Speaker 1:          03:02          There are many equilibria in fact, is a vast number of equilibria. And so which equilibria even assuming that this is a decent model of the economy, the economy, which is not clear, but even assuming it's a good mile, which equilibrium you're in depends on the past history, depends on regulation, depends on politics, depends on taste, depends on changing tastes, changing preferences. And so history matters. And what's called path dependence matters. This takes us outside of the neoclassical model of economics, but it doesn't take us outside of economics because some wiser economist, for example, Brian Arthur had for years been developing models and theories of path dependent economy with a history does matter. People from the area of complex systems like Stu Koufman and provocative and developing models of markets where the history matters, where there's not a single equilibrium where there many equilibria and we're change is paramount, and another symptom of this is is the idea that arbitrage isn't.

Speaker 1:          04:15          I mean in these neoclassical models, when you go to equilibrium, arbitrage is impossible. Arbitrize and making a profit from trading around a circle goods or a circle of currencies without actually producing anything and in equilibrium that's supposed to be impossible, but lots of firms and investment banks and made fortunes off of currency trading. So why is that? Turns out because you never really at equilibrium. So why is the notion of equilibrium so powerful? I think part of the answer is this idea of physics envy that economists thought that what they were doing was more scientific, has more corrected. It looked like physics and physics had this timeless picture in which we're really mattered as we were saying before, is the whole history of the system and in physics there's also a big notion of coming to equilibrium, which is though however it's important to say as a different notion of equilibrium and somehow people in economics got seduced into this model, which again works in the small.

Speaker 1:          05:17          If you have a small little corner of the economy, a small market, it may work for awhile to characterize approximately what's going on. Arbitrage is not always there. It's not always. I mean I recharge. Opportunities do get eaten up the market forces which do push you towards equilibria. There is some truth in it, but the whole thing is a disaster. If I can say that as an outsider and it led indirectly. It wasn't the only reason why regulations were lifted on markets and trading through the decades, but when people were making arguments to Congress, to the president's office there that would be that the economy would be better off without regulation. This was the quote, scientific rationale for it and led to the very unstable situation of the last economic crisis and still a very dangerous and unstable situation in the world economy because, well, I'm not an economist. I'm not going to pontificate about the problems in the economy, but one could see how the idea of timelessness gave false comfort to an unsuccessful scientific theory in the realm of economists of economics.
