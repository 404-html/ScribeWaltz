Speaker 1:          00:14          I think the obstacles are the same as the opportunities. It's the way we like to look at them. We have this really powerful technological infrastructure that can do really tremendous things at the same time. It's never going to be as flexible as we'd like it to be just by nature of, of, of web technology. So, you know, we can deliver news across the globe in a matter of seconds or minutes. And that's pretty amazing and we can create a really, really fascinating tools for our users to take advantage of. Um, at the same time, you know, those technologies don't allow us to, um, to, you know, tool retool a, the appearance or the presentation of every piece of content in exactly the way that we would like. There's, there's a real inherent limitations to the tools. So, um, it's, you know, it's two sides of the same coin.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Sure. We, we often get reader feedback, both positive and negative no matter what we do. Um, you know, let me think. Um, there are times when, um, things that are really obvious to us, you know, and we've really tried to design them in such a way that we think will be obvious to readers who and users who have only casual familiarity with the site and we'll get feedback that, that says, you know, they have no idea that, that, uh, um, what we intended was actually the case. Um, and I'm trying to think of an example off the top of my head right now. Um, you know, we'll, we'll occasionally add sort of alternative views to the homepage, new experimental presentations of our top content features like times wire. We had one called times extra. We have a social networking layer called um, called times people.

Speaker 1:          02:19          Um, and these are things that we spent a lot of time trying to make as intuitive and it's easy to use as possible. Um, and sometimes, you know, we, we hit the mark and a lot of times people will ask us, you know, what does this thing do that you have here? I have really no idea, no understanding of it. And it's just sort of blows us out of the water that you know, that they can be. So, um, you know, what we've designed can be so as unintuitive as, as the reader might be interpreting it as. So that's always a, that's, that's I think one of the hardest and most and most illuminating parts of the job is really, really constantly reminding yourself that what's obvious to you is not obvious to the users.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Well, I'll tell you about a big project that we finished up late last year for we, we have a, um, a luxury magazine that comes into with the Sunday paper called t, um, and that covers, um, men's fashion, women's fashion design, travel, living that, that sort of stuff. Really high end luxury. And we had a site that we launched in 2007, I believe that, um, you know, we felt pretty, pretty good about it at the time, but it quickly became apparent that it was, it was too expensive to produce and wasn't really yielding the results that we were looking for. So we worked most of last year, 2009 really overhauling that sites. Um, and moving it away from what had been a presentation that was really centered around what appeared in print to a brand new kind of user experience that really emphasize what we saw, how we saw users interacting with the content.

Speaker 1:          04:16          So instead of showing all the photography and the photo spreads and the feature stories as the sole main gateway to that site, we've moved to a new kind of experience where the content is, I'm a bit more atomized, you can sort of access it from many different many different ways and we're really emphasizing the blog and have the, uh, the site as, um, the major access point because what we saw was that users responded best to our blog even though it was not the major, the main access point that they responded to its timeliness and its, and the brevity of the content. Um, and so we completely reoriented the sites around that. And, and that was something I really pushed for 'em hard in, uh, in late 2008, early 2009. And we were able to launch it late last year.
