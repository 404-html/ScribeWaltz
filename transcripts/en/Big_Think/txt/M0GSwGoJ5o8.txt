Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:06          when we started the Tribeca film festival, which we announced in 2001 right after nine slash 11, uh, to really bring people back to our neighborhood. Our goal was to just bring as many people back downtown is possible. When we announced the first film festival, we asked Nelson Mandela to come and speak. Our city had been devastated. Our country has been devastated by nine slash 11. And as filmmakers we didn't know what to do other than literally to put on a show and to try to give, to try to give our neighborhood a new memory, to try to give New York a new memory and you just couldn't go like start running movies. So men Mandela came and he talked about when he was in Robben Island, when he was in prison, that the one night that he and his jailers all looked forward to was movie night. It's when they could come together and they could laugh about the same thing.

Speaker 2:          01:14          They could cry about the same thing. And they were, they were one. It was finding their similarities, finding what was human about each of them. And no matter what side of the door either one was going to end up at, at the end of the night. And I always think back to that and the sense of community of coming together as community to watch something is actually extraordinary. When you look at the nea in potential cuts to the nea and you look at what would happen to pbs, uh, it's criminal, okay. The arts reflect to a country what a country is. The arts reflect who we are as a people and to lose that is losing part of our, our soul. You know, the nea has been, you know, there've been other administrations that have tried to cut the nea before, uh, but it's such a small amount in the budget.

Speaker 2:          02:26          And it is again, a reflection of, of, of who we are as a people and no matter where you are in the ecosystem of being a filmmaker, a producer and actor, it is always hard to get your project. Maybe it is, you know, sometimes it happens very quickly, but for the most part, um, it's never easy will artists get by while we find a way to make work. Yes. But when I looked and I talked to a, my friend will be Goldberg. Some of her early work was funded by the NEA. Uh, there is a wonderful piece on youtube of Mr Rogers talking to Senator John Lopez story explaining what he did as Mr Rogers on pbs and it's just so charming to listen to that and you're going, how can you cut that? One of the things is that our best, our best export becomes our, our shows or movies or entertainment.

Speaker 2:          03:34          And um, I remember reading a piece after, um, I think it was nick kristoff writing about how when they first went into Afghanistan and, uh, you know, in the, in the nineties and people were digging up their old vcrs after the Taliban had left. At that time, there were digging, going into the backyard, digging up vrs and they were coming with their, you know, dirty, old brs that they had buried. And um, and the titanic and cassettes at the titanic, I mean, they, they love our love, our movies. They don't always love us, but movies do remain a movie. And I, I, I mean, stories. Our stories become most, uh, valuable, uh, exports.
