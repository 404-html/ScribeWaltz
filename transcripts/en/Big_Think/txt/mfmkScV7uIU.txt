Speaker 1:          00:08          It's odd that I've written two novels out of 12 about Americans who leaves this country and go and live in Canada and stayed there. Um, although, uh, the characters who do that are very different and their reasons for doing so are also different. Uh, the reasons are political and the case of Johnny, we'll write the narrative of a peripheral and meaning. Um, he does hate this country. That's not the case for Danny Boucher. Lupo and his dad, they're fugitives. They're running away. It's not their choice, uh, to go to Canada. Although it does become Danny's choice to stay. Um, I couldn't do that. I couldn't do it primarily as a writer. I think if I'm going to continue to pick on my country in some way as a writer, uh, I better live here. I better be here firsthand. I'm not as an expatriate. Um, so I would disagree with the Ketchum character, uh, in last night in twisted river when he tells Danny that he should leave the country and stay away.

Speaker 1:          01:36          Uh, I, I would disagree with that. Um, in my case, in my case to, unlike Danny, I have three children and four grandchildren. I'm not going anywhere. Um, I live part time in Toronto because my wife is Canadian. Um, but I'm, uh, I'm an American and I, I always will be. I remember thinking in the last years of the Vietnam War that I would never see this country as divided again as it was in those years. But I was wrong. I think, um, we as a people or more divided today, um, I think back in the latter years of the Vietnam War, it was chiefly that war that divided us. I don't think it's fair or enough to say that we are divided today because of, or only because of the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. I think there are other deep political and cultural rifts in this country. A Conservative, liberal riffs, religious and not religious rifts.

Speaker 1:          02:56          I think there are any number of differences among Americans that a divide us, um, angrily, uh, and sharply. Um, and um, you know, boy, I, um, uh, I, I really, um, have the highest hopes, uh, for, uh, President Obama. I, I'm a, I'm very excited about him, but he has inherited such a mess, such a turmoil that I hope people will give him time to sort it out and to undo at least some of the damage that George W Bush did to this country. And I'm, I think I'm already too old to realistically imagine that even if Mr Obama is hugely successful, that he can actually undo all the damage. Um, George W dot Bush did to this country's reputation to the way we are seeing a outside of this country to the way other people in the world, a CIS maybe that can be recovered or that reputation that we once had, can be regained that good reputation.

Speaker 1:          04:45          Uh, maybe it will be regained in my children's lifetime, but I, I don't expect to see it happen. There is, of course, a lot of anti Americanism around the world that is simply a hostile, uh, and vehement. Uh, and I'm motivated by the desire to see any democratic way of life. I'm destroyed. Um, but there's another kind of anti Americanism that we have, um, contributed to. Uh, and, uh, it, it, it embarrasses me. I'm, I'm, I am sick of seeing, um, this country's a bully, patriotism, uh, used as a smokescreen and as a cover up for things we haven't done right.
