Speaker 1:          00:05          I remember the first search engines came around and back then Alta Vista was a very big thing. I'll try to strike a balance between the inconveniences in terms of advertising and so on. They could put on the user and the utility had for the users, so it would, for instance, mixed search results with advertising and at this point Google came along. Google was very small and inconsequential and nobody really took it seriously, but it did an amazing thing. It did give people exactly what they wanted. It give them a pretty much ad free experience. I gave them exactly the search result that they wanted, the best one's closest ones to what people wanted to have. Google dramatically outperformed Alta Vista, Altavista disappeared, and that was an amazing insight to see that if you are in a dramatically scalable economy like the Internet for you have the biggest amount of competition that you can possibly have.

Speaker 1:          00:58          You need to build a product that is optimally aligned with the interests of the users unless you manage to get some kind of monopoly and can drive out all the competition. And so when we build new products in that space, we have to think about how to build the most useful product, not necessarily just the product that is going to make the biggest amount of money that is going to have the most efficient business model in some sense, or the best business case. Eventually it's going to be the product that is getting the most used by people and people will find out that they will use most what is most useful to them in the long run. That's going to be the staff that is not addictive, hygienic, that serves the actual needs that makes them more happy and fulfilled. And right now we mostly build applications that utilize the cravings of people that make them addicted. People start checking their smartphones every few seconds to see if a new email arrived, but this new email is not going to make them more happy and fulfilled is instead it takes survey their attention. So I believe the next big movement in how we built technical systems will be hygienic technology. It will be how to build systems that is careful with our attention, how we use it, and that is careful of is our way of living and what we want to achieve is the tools that we are building.
