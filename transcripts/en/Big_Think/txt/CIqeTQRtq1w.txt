Speaker 1:          00:18          I think there is, there are some interesting faces, um,

Speaker 2:          00:23          where people get it wrong and we know why they got it wrong. And this, and this often occurs in the case when you have very distinctive items. And so this is one of the things that once you kind of get expert at it, you've got to watch out for cause it cause as I say, we are, what we're looking for is we're looking for patterns. We're looking for overall patterns and things that are distinctive by, by nature of being distinct. They're inconsistent with a patent, but they'd draw your attention. So we went into one of the rooms, we went into everything, indicated it was a socially responsible person who was um, uh, a nice person.

Yet in the corner of the room there was a plastic crate full of drug paraphernalia or a bong for smoking marijuana and stuff like that.

Speaker 2:          01:20          And of course the judges come in and they see that which sticks out and they go straight over to it and I likely to interpret it, you know, make, draw strong inferences from it. Of course, the very reason that makes it stick out is the very reason they should have ignored it. And it turns out when I later found out what was, what was, what was it doing there? It turns out that this person was holding onto the, um, uh, have a roommate had gone traveling around the world and tech. Could you look after this stuff's good? Yeah, sure. I'll put it on. She put it responsibly, put it in a crate and put it in the corner of the room. So, you know, it was,

Speaker 3:          01:53          it was consistent with above 90, but not in the way you were thinking.
