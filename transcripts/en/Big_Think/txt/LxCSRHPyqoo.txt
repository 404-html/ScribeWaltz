Speaker 1:          00:03          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08          I think it's a bad idea when people try to design ways to create a public life, a public square that's free of religion and the religion talk because there are people from, that's how they're comfortable talking. Some people like Tom to economic theory or some people have a historical view of the world. Some people have a view of the world that comes from their faith. People's views come all different sources. I think it's important to have a public square that embraces these different ways of looking at the world and if there's something that I believe about public life that's really it, that it ought to be open and we ought to really try to have actual dialogue and think about dialogue to make it real is we have to engage in listening with our ears. When we tend to do in America is listen with our mouths.

Speaker 2:          00:53          We tend to listen to the other fellows argument for the sole purpose of spotting the errors so we can refute it. The absurdity that they call presidential debates in America, which are not debates at all, but joint press conference is run by and for the media. I think candidates should avoid them like the plague. They're horrible, but that absurdity captures what I mean. There's no time there for a measured conversation. There's no time there to explain a position. All you have time do is lash out, call somebody's name, use the right buzzwords in it's somebody else's turn. Well, that's not democracy. That's a mockery. That is simply a, an excuse for avoiding what we really need, which is actual conversation. Of course, our differences instead of buzzwords and name calling across our differences.
