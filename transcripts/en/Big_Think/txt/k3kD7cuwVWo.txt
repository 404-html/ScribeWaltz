Speaker 1:          00:08          Grandmothers ravioli. There's something I was doing for years. I was doing there, my cafe balloons and I started them as a Sunday special, uh, just cause it seemed, you know, within that context of kind of French American international kind of flavors to have something on Sunday that was kind of comforting. Um, are they my grandmother's wherever you all these. Exactly. No, I mean she never used short ribs in them and uh, you know, didn't use fresh tomato for the sauce. Uh, it's kind of like an in quotes, inspiration type of thing. Um, but I'm Italian and Polish and, uh, that's uh, you know, to good cooking cuisines. Um, one doesn't have a lot of vegetables in it, the other one does, but it's, uh, you know, to kind of good cooking cultures,

Speaker 1:          01:05          Italian restaurant. So I want to keep it in Italian, in spirit. You know, uptown. When I was the chef at cafe blue, I had, uh, I had some, my grandmother's parole, he's on the menu and they were pretty good. Uh, they, uh, they got some, you know, they got some mentions. I didn't really promote them or anything. They just put them on the menu just because I wanted to make some, and they were a little bit fancy. Um, it was like three different flavors. And I made a sauce with the juice from the Sauerkraut, homemade Sauerkraut, and it had like poppy seeds and Julian apple and stuff like that on it. So it was kind of like a fancy version of the progress that we used to buy when I was a kid at the parochial church, which was down the street.

Speaker 2:          01:52          It's an interesting little,

Speaker 1:          01:54          uh, a similar thing, but the routines, which are the eye, the half my town and families from Friuli and they were a French family that immigrated from Paris to freely in the mid 18 hundreds. Uh, so my grandmother was half French and, uh, she also, uh, spoke highly of people like the scuff ea had all these stories, kind of mixed it in there.
