Speaker 1:          00:00          Everybody seems to think that Obama is in his heart, an atheist in India's hardest skeptic. The church he belonged to in Chicago is a whack job church. It's about equal to Payton's church. Granted, he hasn't been as religious as do we know? Do we know off the top of our heads, the most religious president in history, in terms of references referencing to God references to God and in terms of appearing in churches who the most religious president history was. It's an interesting answer and I get this information from NPR, so it's probably not slanted in the way you'd think. The most religious president in history, in terms of appearances in churches and mentions of the Bible was Clinton. Bill Clinton is the most religious president we've had. He Beats George Bush, hands down, and he beats Carter, who you know was a born again Christian. He beats him hands down.

Speaker 1:          00:58          So Obama does that too. I mean to the nine slash 11 thing. Maybe appropriately he read from the Bible, but you have two choices with Obama. You either believe that he is a man of Christ who prays for decisions in the White House, which he said he was, or you think he's a liar. And I'm surprised by the number of atheists, pre thinkers that support Obama and their argument is essentially he's lying about being religious cause you have to do that to be elected. Uh, I'm not happy with either one of those. I mean, Obama is wicked smart. He's a wicked good talker. There is no doubt in my mind that his heart is in the right place. Unfortunately, I think that about almost every president we've had, but I think he wants to do good. I don't think there's any malicious quality to them at all, but I think it's some sense he's a believer or he's a liar.

Speaker 1:          01:58          So one to 10. I rate them pretty high on the skepticism a maybe a six or a seven, but I rate them that way because somewhere in my heart I think he might be lying about being religious and that's horrible. It's a horrible reason to like somebody. I like him because he may be a liar. Mirabelle Michele Bachmann's blast for me is greater than anything I've ever accomplished. Uh, I have tried with friends to say the most blasphemous his sentence I can possibly say, and it does not come close to the blasphemy of Michele Bachmann saying that earthquakes and hurricanes were the way God was trying to get the attention of politicians. I cannot imagine a serious religious person reading that quote or hearing that quote and saying, yeah, right on. It is solid cystic. It is opportunistic. It is cynical. It is deep and it is wrong.

Speaker 1:          03:10          And it is an insult to religious people everywhere. For an atheist, it's a, it's a burlesque. It's a little bit of a joke. You can dismiss her, but I can't see it as an atheist. I see it from through my father's eyes. You know, my father was a Christian his whole life, and if he had heard Michele Bachmann say that he would have looked away from the TV, the idea that you would lightly state that people were suffering and dying in order to, to prove that God was on the side of one politician is sickening. The only reason that Bachman and Rick Perry are able to say this stuff is because of a magic word, and this magic word is Christian, and if you look back in history, the word Christian doesn't really appear in the way we use it today until the anti abortion debate in the sixties when you had 1890 end of the 19th century, your top three highest paid speakers.

Speaker 1:          04:21          The highest paid speakers were atheist speaking about atheism. Robert Ingersoll number one, Mark Twain, number two, Huxley. Number three. Ingersoll was the, uh, the, the great infidel, the great skeptic, be a theist. Mark Twain, of course. And these are people speaking on. He was not reading from, it was not reading from Oxfam. He was reading from letters from Earth. He was reading atheist stuff and Huxley, Darwin's a pit bull, I guess bulldog at that time, I think if it has been, but there was a real sense of atheism being an important point. They were invited to the White House. And the reason was that Catholics were terrified of baptists who were terrified of pentecostals or terrified of Lutherans who were terrified of evangelicals. The whole list. There wasn't a feeling of Christian. The founding fathers were very afraid of baptists taking over from the pentecostals. Everybody was afraid of the Catholics.

Speaker 1:          05:21          So you had this divided thing. If we still had that, if we still were dividing people by sex, like we should be sex like we should be. One of the largest groups in this country would be atheists by the USA Today poll, I think it was 22 percent, 20 percent even the lowest polls put it at eight. Okay. The next highest would be Catholics and they'd be knocking around 20. You know, then you've got all your divided up categories. And then abortion happens. A legalized abortion. And some very smart people. Very forward thinking. People decided we can never fight abortion if it's the Catholics fighting the Protestants and finding the baptists. Pentecostals fight it. We have to get them under one tent. And there's a great book on this called the history of free thought that these are not my ideas. They pull this tent together and they kind of create the word Christian and then Carter with born again.

Speaker 1:          06:27          Christian really helps with the word Christian. So what they've really done is they've taken very different philosophies. I mean Catholicism and Protestantism. Protestantism are very different philosophies, very different, you know, and they've pulled it together to make this term Christian, which are people that don't agree at all and they say, I'm doing a Christian message. So Michelle Bachmann and Rick Perry just 40 years ago really recently would have been terrified to speak about their God and their church because the second they said they were baptist, the second they said they were pentecostal, the second they said they were Lutheran, all the other people fall away. But now they've got this magic word Christian. And I am helping make it worse because by using the word atheist, I am separating that even more from Christian. I'm doing a broader umbrella and I'm making theist, atheist. And if you do, theist, atheist, the thesis when completely, you know, what I should be doing.

Speaker 1:          07:38          If I were a, a, uh, a political thinker, if I were someone that was interested in movements, which I'm not, I'm against them. If I wasn't for individual thinking, I would be one of those people who was saying using a term like free thinker or open minded and I will be gathering this umbrella that included, um, uh, people who self identify as agnostic or atheist against organized religion. I would get the wiccans in there. I would get as many people as possible and I could probably pump that up to 25 percent. And then I would be also saying, well, you know, the Muslims are very different from the Jews who are very different from the Catholics who are very different from all of that. But what's going to happen? And, uh, because I'm not interested in tactical play, but rather in telling the truth, we're going to get theist, atheist.

Speaker 1:          08:39          But you can imagine, we can imagine in 1965 a baptist talking baptist politician talking about religion and where they go to church, if they have to use word baptist, it's using the word Christian that allows this craziness to happen. Also, because I am an optimist, to the point of being incorrect, to the point of not being realistic. That's what flushes over me. It's what I feel in my heart is optimism. I tend to go with something Christopher Hitchens said, I don't remember where he said it could have even been in personal conversation. I don't know, but I'm hitchens said that what we're seeing with this incredible, crazy religious stuff is the death throws. I mean, since nine slash 11, a free thinking. Atheism is growing so quickly because of the Internet and people who were seeing it first with those who are called. And I realized this is a racist term, but it's easiest one to use.

Speaker 1:          09:46          So please forgive me. Uh, Gypsy's. We're seeing it with the amish. We're seeing it with the citrix. Uh, all the groups that try to stay as a subset of America and keep their own traditions are going away. And Elvis chipped away at them and malls chipped away at them, but the Internet is going to take them down. It's just too hard to keep your children cloistered. They're going to hear Katy Perry. There's just no way to stop it. They're going to see a video like this. You know, once you've gotten on the Internet to see Katy Perry, it's not hard to fall over to the big thing. It's the same keyboard. It's the same screen. It's the same everything and those that information gets out there and I think that everybody knows that and everybody feels that so that those who are religious, you're seeing a a, a desperate, terrified clawing, and that's the only way you can explain Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry is the combination of desperation coupled with the magic protective word of Christian.

Speaker 1:          10:59          The problem is a movement of individuals is not going to have the muscle of a cohesive movement of people who believe they're right and I'm not willing to lie to fight them. I want individuals who disagree on everything and I want us to learn to band together for freedom band together in order to be different, and that's a much harder thing to sell, but it's all that matters. So we have to do it. Mitt Romney is wearing crazy underwear. He's wearing magic underwear. He is under his pants. He is wearing magic underwear, magic underwear, and he believes that a convicted con man got golden tablets that no one else could see and sat with an angel to find out that the original Jews of the Bible were living in North America.

Speaker 1:          11:59          Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, but just more modern, not more crazy than other religions, not more crazy than Islam, you know, with, with, uh, not more crazy than virgin births. And resurrections, uh, not more crazy than any of that stuff. It fascinates me that you can have the Bible belt and you can have a court trial, and we've seen this. I'm going to use it hypothetically, but you'll know the specifics I'm talking about. I just don't want to talk about that kind of pain directly. It's too unpleasant for me. But hypothetically, if the Bible belt where you can have a born again, Christian judge, born again, Christian judge, I believe the Bible is the literal word of God. There were talking snakes. They were talking snakes and virgin births, burning bushes, and Abraham being willing to kill his son for God. He believes that the jury is made up of 12 people who let's say 10 of them believed that and to have them believe that, but a little less, you're prosecuting attorney believes that the people that are sitting in the courtroom believed that these are all people that know each other in church and the person on the witness stand says that she killed her three children in cold blood because God told her to and every single person in the courtroom decides whether she is guilty or not guilty by reason of insanity.

Speaker 1:          13:54          Those are the two choices they way and nobody, not the defense attorney, not the judge, not the jury people, not the people in the gallery, not one person stands up and goes, maybe God told her to. It's. It's less weird than the talking snake. Maybe God told her to and in this country which they say over and over again is founded on Christian values and I'll give them that founded on Christian values. Okay, it is fine. This country founded on Christian values has guilty not guilty, not guilty by reason of insanity. End of list. There is nothing that says not guilty because God told me to and why? Why isn't that there? Why isn't this country allowing them, the court system, someone to go on the witness stand and go, snake walk up to me. Snake opened his mouth. Snake said, go into Mcdonald's. Pull out an eight K, 15 killed 10 people walk back out.

Speaker 1:          15:09          Snake told me that it's that snake there. He's not talking anymore. I throw myself on the mercy of the court. Aren't you all good Christians? Don't you believe in the miracles of the Bible? You're seeing one now and that's. That's the part that amazes me is that kind of stuff. So Mitt Romney comes along and at some level doesn't he know what he believes is crazy at some level is any going. Weren't Jews in North America? You know that's not where the garden of Eden was. Doesn't that go through his mind? And that's the part of that whole thing that kills me. If Mitt Romney, he really believes what he says, he believes he is bugged, nutty bat shit crazy and he's not bugged. Nutty batshit crazy. He's the same as Obama. If Obama believes what he was being taught in that church in Chicago, okay, he is bat shit crazy and Obama is demonstrative.

Speaker 1:          16:23          Lee Not batshit crazy. So we have this weird deal we make with all the politicians where we say you can say you believe bug nutty bat shit, crazy shit, and we'll shrug it off because you're clearly not bugged. Nutty batshit crazy. And all I want out of our politicians is for them to just say, you know, a lot of the religious stuff I'm talking about is bugged, duddy bad shit. Crazy. But I'm not because I don't think any of these men and women are crazy and I'll even give you Michele Bachmann. I'll even give you a rick Perry. I'll even give you Sarah Pailin. I don't have that cynical msnbc point of view that they are bugged, nutty batshit crazy. I think they are good people who somehow think that their morality and their love for humanity and their love for their families are tied up in this weird tradition and when they think that the Bible is the word of God, I think they mean something else.

Speaker 1:          17:30          I sometimes think that many other people are speaking in a code that I've not been given. The key to. When someone says to me, I believe in the Bible literally, well, I personally pendulum read about a chapter of the Bible a day. I just read through it over and over again, so when someone says they believe in the word of God, literally I go back and think about genesis where people are living to be 900 years old and I say bullshit and then I even think about noah and the flood killing everybody, God that loves us, kills everybody and he wants to get two of every species and several of the ones that are clean onto a boat that floats for that amount of time and I just go, because you don't act that way. You're able to go to home depot. You're able to play pay with a credit card.

Speaker 1:          18:24          You're able to go to starbucks. You know how to use the computer. Really. Do you really mean that? What do you mean literally? Do you really mean you're going to stone someone to death who because they work on the sabbath or you're really going to do that? Really honestly, you're going to take a rock in your hand and throw it in a motherfucker's head because he worked on a Sunday to support his family or you're really going to do that if you mix cotton and linen and your clothing or you're really going to go to hell. What do you mean when you say that? And no one's ever answered me? There's a cold going on that I need the Rosetta stone. I need someone to sit me down and go, pen put. Obama says he went to that church and they talked about all this stuff being literal. What he really meant was fill in the blank, telling me what is the really mean? These people are good on this. Smart. Not Bad shit. Crazy people, so why the fuck are they saying bad shit? Crazy stuff to me.
