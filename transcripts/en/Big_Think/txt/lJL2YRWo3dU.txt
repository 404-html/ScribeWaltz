Speaker 1:          00:09          Health care is hugely inefficient industry Mckinsey analyze the American healthcare system versus healthcare systems in the other country and it came up with a figure that there is about a half a trillion dollars of. I would put it waste in the US healthcare system. The biggest source of waste is the way we treat people with chronic diseases. Diseases like diabetes, AIDS, heart disease, cancer, people who have chronic disabilities like bad backs, and we treat them in a very fragmented way. We have no one organization that is responsible for everything that the person with diabetes has. Everything that the person with AIDS needs, needs. People have tremendously complicated needs there in diseases core multifactorial, and they manifest themselves in many different ways. What we need as a healthcare system that's organized around the needs of the patient for total care for their diseases, total care for their disability. What we have as a healthcare system that's organized by inputs, doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, each one of these inputs, each one of these providers, what did they want? Well, they hilman. What they want is they want to make sure that they met summize, their share of their pie. Maximizing their share of the pie is not the same as doing what's best for that patient.
