Speaker 1:          00:04          The autism flat, and I do think that it is accurate to say that the information technology industry made other countries, particularly the United States recognize the changes that had taken place in India and recognize the potential because of course it was for some time the largest, uh, exchange between India and the United States was in the IT industry. And of course this is not only because we are on opposite sides of the globe. So, uh, you know, the day or night factor plays very nicely for walk in both countries, but also because a fairly large number of Indian origin Americans in Silicon Valley, we're making their mark. They were part of the innovative ideas that were germinating in the silicon valley. They were part of the way the connection was made between Bangalore and the Silicon Valley. And so, uh, I think that maybe the recognition by the, uh, by the, uh, United States came as the relationship in ICT expanded. Uh, but, uh, I think that there are lots of other areas in which as well we have the institute for Economic Exchange.
