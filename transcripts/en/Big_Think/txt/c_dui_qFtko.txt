Speaker 1:          00:06          Oh, I'm art. Learn a loud. I'm a seismologist at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. Uh, I'm also associate director for the division of Seismology Geology and tectonic physics. Oh, seismology is a study of earthquakes and the earth. Uh, there are two parts of seismology want us to actually look in detail at the earthquakes themselves. And the other is to use the earthquakes as a sort of light source for photographing or imaging the earth imaging. The earth is something that we sometimes call it structural seismology but very much like a cat scan you might get an a medical office. We use the waves generated by earthquakes to aluminate this internal structure of the earth. Uh, one of the great mysteries of the planet is what is your Earth made out of? How does that stuff move? And seismology is really a remote sensing tool for us to try to understand that.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Well, one of, one of the wonderful things that has happened in the earth sciences over the last 40 years is what we call the theory of plate tectonics. And Plate tectonics really is a very descriptive working hypothesis that allows us to take diverse sets of observations and put them together and see if we can understand how the, how the planet as a whole works. Uh, but plate tectonics really is just a, a kinematic theory. What that means is that it really only describes the motions of the plates, how fast they move, uh, what their boundaries look like and so on. Um, but we really don't know how they move or what forces them to move. And to do that, we really have to penetrate into the interior of the earth. Now, in many ways, the earth is like a big bubbling pot of fix soup, non geologic time.

Speaker 1:          01:55          The earth is really a fluid. Of course on human time. It's a rock. You hit a rock with a hammer and my crumble and break a, but on geologic time, the earth really behaves like a big melted plastic ball. And, uh, it's the movement of that molten material, uh, that plastic, that warm plastic material that really drives the plates, but we can't observe it directly. And so we use earthquakes and, and uh, what we call structural seismology, uh, to image it. Um, if you were taking a, or if you were interested in the workings of the human body, uh, what you would do would be to take a cat scans or three dimensional images from time to time to time to get sort of a, a movie of how the body works. Well, that's exactly what we're doing with the seismology. We take cat scans, time, time, time, and it gives us some indication of, of what's going on. Uh, of course, uh, we can't do our experiments in geologic time. It would just take too long. So we use proxies to get, let us attain kind of a movie. Uh, it's something that we sometimes call four d seismology.

Speaker 1:          03:06          Well, a 40 seismology really means that we're looking at the earth in three dimensions, uh, uh, up down north, south, east, west, the three physical dimensions of our real world and sort of getting a time history. Geologic time occurs over millions of years. So he, uh, you know, the lifetime of a single scientist, he can observe that. But over the years, we've developed proxies to replace that. And we can use seismology, we can use petrology, the study of rocks. Uh, we can look at the ages of rocks and various ways we can even use paleontology, the study of fossils to get some indication of what the history of the earth looks like. Um, but the, the, you know, the real, uh, incredible thing that has happened is that the three dimensional aspect of that problem, uh, has really just exploded in the last decade or so. Um, you know, seismic instrumentation used to be pen and paper, uh, used to have these rotating drums with a pen that would wiggle every time and earthquake waves passed for example.

Speaker 1:          04:10          Uh, but right now we of course would record that digital and that's like the move from analog tape to, to cds or dvds. Um, so that's one, one element. But the other is that, uh, you know, we used to have to wait for an earthquake and we didn't have very many instruments in the ground, just a couple of hundred a, but now we can put thousands of instruments into the ground. And so we get a much finer picture, much more highly resolved picture like as if you, we had been shooting through cheesecloth or a gauze or vaseline or something like that. We, we, we've never been able to really see the earth and all its clarity and now we can, um, we're part of a project called Earth scope, for example, which is like a giant high resolution telescope, not pointed to the universe, but pointed down into the earth. Uh, we know less about the earth really than we know about the universe at this point. Uh, but this telescope is just giving us fantastic images. We're starting off with the North American continent and our hope is that over the next decades will be doing that around the earth as well.

Speaker 1:          05:17          Bell earthquakes are a weird kind of phenomenon in the following sense. Um, when we talk about the theory of plate tectonics, the, the working hypothesis is that it's a smooth motion of the plates, uh, that the plates move over geologic time with predictable rates. Uh, it's as if they're, uh, kind of a slow movement of traffic, if you will. Everybody sort of moving at a rate that stays constant in time. But obviously earthquakes happen. Earthquakes predominantly occur where the plates interact with one another along what we call plate boundaries. Obviously, uh, sometimes those plate boundaries or sideways like we have in the San Andreas fault or the earthquake that happened in Haiti. Uh, sometimes those boundaries are compressional like what happened in Chile or what might happen off the coast of Seattle. And, uh, sometimes those boundaries are what we call extensional. Uh, best example of this would be the basin and range and the western United States, uh, around the longitude of Salt Lake City going all the way west to the Sierra.

Speaker 1:          06:21          Uh, so those three types of boundaries sort of describe what, how the plates inter interact, but earthquakes, of course, anodic continuous process by any means there really what we call a stick slip process. So while the hypothesis of plate tectonics or the working model is that the plates move, uh, at a relatively constant rate at the boundaries, they stick and they slip a, the boundaries don't move at a relatively constant rate. Instead the boundaries stick and when they stick, the movement of the plates stresses that boundary and eventually that stress overcomes the strength of that boundary and it breaks. And that breakage is an earthquake as sort of our, what we call the stick slip model or a, we have other names for it. But that's basically what happens. Um, the problem that we face as earthquake seismologist is that sticking and slipping is almost a chaotic process, not quite, but almost.

Speaker 1:          07:18          And so it's very difficult to predict on a day to day basis over geologic time. Of course, it's very predictable. We can get an idea of where the active plate boundaries are a those plate boundaries, of course our major faults in the earth. And, uh, we know where the earthquakes will occur, but because we can't predict the stick and slips cycle very well of certainly over human timescales, uh, we can't really get what we call a prediction. Uh, but there's a deeper understanding of it that that allows us to forecast instead of predict. And by forecast, I mean, well first of all, we know where they occur because we know where the plate boundaries are. Um, but we can get a sense of what the probability of an earthquake might be in two ways. One, by looking at the past history and if we have enough earthquakes, we can sort of get a statistical model of, of wind and earthquakes might occur and that gives us some probability.

Speaker 1:          08:16          And the other is to actually do a bit of forward modeling and actually take the plate motions, take a model of, of the friction along the plate boundary. Uh, take a model of how the stress builds up and sort of predict when and where or I should say forecast when the next earthquake might occur. And it's gotten to the point where we can probably do that over the span of a decade or two, perhaps 30 years. Uh, to the extent that we can, uh, sort of provide an actuarial table, uh, if you want to go out and buy insurance in California. As a matter of fact, there is such an actuarial table to help you determine what your rates are or I should say a healthy insurance companies determine what they're going to charge you. And of course we didn't have that for Haiti. Uh, we had barely had that for Chile. Uh, but the point is we're getting better at it. So, you know, one of the exciting parts of earthquake seismology is that the better we get at forecasting earthquakes, the closer we might actually come to a prediction that is useful on human timescales.

Speaker 1:          09:22          Whether an unusual in the sense that statistically it's unusual. Uh, you could say it's just a statistical anomalies, statistical fluke. There's no reason to think that earthquakes are occurring any more frequently now than they, than they occurred last year or 10 years ago or 10 years into the future. There's no reason to believe that, and it has nothing to do with global warming. Believe me, that's a question that we often get. Well, one of the things we learned seismologists is that earthquakes and occurred anytime and any place, in fact, they don't even have to occur at plate boundaries for that matter. But that's, that's a whole other topic. Uh, but along some of the major plate boundaries like the Pacific northwest, uh, we have evidence of pastor earthquakes. And that's actually, it's an interesting thing. Obviously we didn't have instruments going back more than about a hundred years or so. So we don't have an instrumental record, but we have a record from a newspaper, old newspapers for example, we have a record from some old mission records, particularly in California, Spanish mission records and elsewhere throughout the western hemisphere.

Speaker 1:          10:24          Uh, we have very long, uh, historical records and China and Japan and in parts of Asia where people have been writing things down for quite a few centuries. Uh, but in some places we simply don't have that written record and we have to rely again on proxies. Um, there are a couple of things we can do in a place like California or Seattle, the state, California first. Uh, one thing we can do when we have a fault like the San Andreas is to actually dig a trench across that fault. And when we trench across false like that, and you do that, trenching it at different places, you can actually see in the disturbed soil the record of pastor earthquakes, it may occur every hundred and 50 or 200 or three or 400 years, uh, but with very good carbon dating or other geological techniques, uh, we can get a good sense of what that history is.

Speaker 1:          11:16          And by doing that trenching at various places along the fault, we can even get a, an estimate of the, of the size of the rupture, which gives us a way to calculate the magnitude that then allows us to calculate the repeat intervals, say for these very large earthquakes in Seattle, or I should say more generally off the coast of, um, uh, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon going down into northern California. That's a different kind of a plate boundary. It's what we call a subduction zone. It's a convergent boundary. It creates the cascades and the volcanoes, uh, so we can't trench it. Um, but what we can do is look at the history of uplift on the coast because every time an earthquake occurs, uh, the upper plate, which is basically the coast of Washington and Oregon and northern California gets bumped up a little bit. And by looking at the sediment Terry record, actually sometimes it can go down as well.

Speaker 1:          12:10          But you know, at looking at the cinnamon Terry Record, uh, looking at the way, say even trees or drowned by encroaching water or lifted above the water table or so on a, you can get a sense of the history, uh, uh, people who look at things like tree rings or the history of corals, the ornate corals up there now. But if we go elsewhere around the world, we see that these are all proxies for past big earthquakes. There's another proxy which, um, in particular for the Pacific Northwest Works and that is, uh, earthquakes along that boundary have a tendency to generate a tsunami. And when it's an Ami, propagates moot or moves across the Pacific Ocean, particularly a big one when it hits islands, uh, on the other side of the Pacific, uh, you get what's called tsunami deposits. It's a, it's a very turbulent phenomenon, brings up pebbles and rocks and disturbs the beaches and, uh, you can detect some of those.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Um, but in particularly for the, for the particular case of the Pacific northwest, uh, around 1700, actually in 1700 a tsunami was generated. It was recorded in Japan. And by looking at the tsunami records in Japan, both the historical record and the actual geologic record of that tsunami modelers have been able to kind of back project that go backwards across the Pacific show that the source of that tsunami was in fact the Pacific northwest, and get a good date 1700, uh, for that event. That event looks like to be about a magnitude nine, nine and a half. That's bigger than what we had in Chile last, uh, just a few weeks ago. Uh, and it's about as big as the biggest earthquake we've recorded instrumentally. So now that we know that that boundary can support a monstrous earthquake, magnitude nine, we can go about the job of measuring how fast the plates are converging, making some assumptions about how stress is building up and come up with some sense of what the repeat interval might be for that earthquake. And, uh, sad to say we're pretty close to the repeat interval for that earthquake. So that's a forecast. It's not a prediction, it's a forecast. And thankfully, at least in the United States going back a decade or more, uh, seattle and Oregon had been well aware of the potential for that earthquake and they're taking the appropriate steps. One would say to try to mitigate the potential damage.

Speaker 1:          14:47          You know, we, we do talk about things like the big one, one in a little, uh, how big it will be, what the impact will be. A curious thing by the ways that it we're getting better at predicting the impact of an earthquake, then we are actually predicting an earthquake. Now, once we know, uh, that, uh, uh, once we have a scenario earthquake for example, of a certain size, a certain location, our computer modeling really is very good. So we can actually, uh, with a computer generate the possible ground motion from a scenario earthquake. We know how buildings interact with the ground and what will cause a building to fall down. We even have a reasonable estimates of the casualties that might arise and, uh, the economic damage as well. Uh, so we're getting very good at predicting the damage. Um, and we've constructed such a scenario for California.

Speaker 1:          15:40          And the reason for that is that over the next few decades, 30 to 50 years, the chance of having a major earthquake in California, uh, is pretty close to one pretty close to unity. Um, in some sense it's really safe for a seismologist to say that because earthquakes happen, uh, almost certainly a large earthquake is going to happen in California. So, uh, I'm, you know, I'm not sticking my neck out by saying there's a good chance of an earthquake happening, but the question is how, where it will be and how big it will be and that we base on trenching. We base on a, base it on very fine measurements of the crust moving. Uh, we have better calibrated models of the faults and the frictions on the faults. And so we're coming up with, uh, a sort of a community understanding of what the big one might be.

Speaker 1:          16:32          Uh, the US Geological Survey, uh, a, an academic consortium called the southern California earthquake center, which actually involves seismologists from all over the US, if not the globe. Uh, I've come together with a consensus statement that California rupture forecast as it were. And the two areas that are potentially very dangerous are a repeat of a major earthquake along the southern San Andres east of Los Angeles, but still close enough to do considerable damage to Los Angeles. And of course in the inland empire east, uh, basically along itn and going down toward Palm Springs, uh, uh, there's a good chance of significant damage and significant casualties there. The second area is up in the East Bay, not a repeat of the 1906 earthquake, which is on the, which wasn't on this, uh, the San Francisco peninsula, but in the East Bay and long something called the hayward fault, really part of the San Andrea system, but a separate fault that's the fault that colloquially you may remember sort of runs right through the Berkeley football stadium, the hills above Berkeley and so on.

Speaker 1:          17:39          So, you know, cal might have difficulty feeling of football team with that earthquake occurs, but nor predictions of damage there are pretty severe as well. Uh, but again, you know, knowledge of what might happen and particularly the damage that might happen, uh, goes a great way to providing the political will. In fact, the funding to do something about it can't stop. It can't stop an earthquake, but it can build strong buildings. You can prepare the population and you can make people aware of what they might do when they feel an earthquake. Um, and there are other steps we can take as well. Uh, you know, we can't predict, uh, we're getting better at forecasting, but there's also something interesting called earthquake early warning systems. And this is something that, um, uh, has taken a while to develop. But when you think about it is kind of obvious.

Speaker 1:          18:28          And when we start with the following analogy, uh, earthquake waves that it in earthquake occurs, it generates ground motion. That ground motion leaves the earthquake zone and the rupture zone in a series of waves. And there are several types of waves and the old move at different speeds. We've, you know, some of our students learned that he's a primary secondary surface waves and so on. And the primary words are very fast. The secondary waves are slower and the surface waves are slower still. What's interesting about that, that progression is that the primary or waves though fast, uh, aren't very large. Secondary waves are slower but larger. And the surface waves slower, still our largest still. And so it's large ways that do most of the damage. So the theory is that if you could detect that little bit of a p wave coming along, it's not going to do a lot of damage, uh, but uh, might give you enough time ranging from a few seconds, a few tens of seconds, uh, to, uh, maybe even close to a minute or so or more. Uh, it might give you enough time to do the sort of things that would save people safe structures. Uh, you could stop trains, you could shut off gas, uh, you could, uh, get people to, uh, find safe haven inside the buildings for example. Uh, if you could do that, that would constitute a pretty decent early warning system. And so their experiments and trying to do that, it's been implemented. Japan, it's been implemented in Taiwan. Um, and, uh, there are, uh, other countries around trying to, to investigate these systems.

Speaker 1:          20:06          You know, preparing for an earthquake is multifaceted, multi dimensional. And the first thing really is being aware. Uh, yes, I've said that earthquakes and occur anywhere, but they're more likely some places than others. So you know, basic awareness of where your house, where you work, uh, where you are relative to the faults that might cause an earthquake. That's a matter of public education. Um, but once you know what you're a risk might be, uh, you have to make some sort of personal judgment or if you're a government, some sort of social judgment about the level of risk that you're willing to accept is going to be. And if you're willing to accept or only willing to accept a low level of risk, then there are a number of things you need to do, you to ensure that major infrastructure is resilient, that our water lines are power lines are built in such a way so that they won't break that bridges and highways one fall down.

Speaker 1:          21:08          That fire stations will remain standing so that the fire personnel can respond and that hospitals remain standing, um, with respect to individuals in their homes. Uh, if you're an earthquake zone, ensuring that your building is up to code, if a code exists, um, ensuring that you follow that code and even little things like keeping the knickknacks away from the edge of the shelf, keeping your dishes way back. Those are the sorts of things that could make the difference between sort of a Ho hum boy was that an interesting event to something that was a disaster. Um, and these are all written down. You can go to the fema websites, USG, s websites. There were a whole list of these things. The problem arises when first you don't have building codes, uh, or those codes aren't enforced. That was a situation in Haiti where you don't have the national or social wealth to actually consider this something you can do.

Speaker 1:          22:05          I mean, they're the, and I don't mean to bring up Haiti constantly, but the issue there was that there were so many sort of day to day problems facing a Haiti culture in Haiti government. That's something that might happen, uh, really can't get on the radar screen. And you could argue the right or wrong to that. But that basically is a situation and sad to say that's tap us throughout the world. Um, so you know, the basic things really quite easy to do if you've got the money to do them and if you've got the public awareness to do them and if you've got the political will to do them. If you're dealing with the Commons, if you're dealing with infrastructure, uh, where you don't have the political will or the wealth, uh, there are a number of things that the community is trying to do.

Speaker 1:          22:51          There's a lot of concentration on building small scale community awareness so that the awareness of disaster, the awareness of potential disaster I should say, uh, occurs almost at the household level and enabling people to make decisions but also giving them sort of the simple things that they, that they could do on a day to day basis. Uh, not just for earthquakes but for floods, for landslides. Uh, and for that matter, for longer term issues like sea level rise and climate change. Uh, you know, one of the, one of the key things that we're doing at our institute and elsewhere is trying to, to bring the knowledge we have about earth processes near. So dynamic planet. It's fun to look at. We enjoy doing that, but it affects people. And one of the things we're trying to do is to bring that knowledge, not just throw it over the fence so that policy makers can use it because you know, there's none of a feedback and that kind of a system. Uh, we really, scientists need to understand social and cultural constraints on using the information and in fact, even the utility of the information that they provide. And if I may say, I think the social scientists and governments and ngos need to know what they don't know and that's a difficult task. Uh, but to be honest, it's an interesting and important thing to do and we're getting better at it.

Speaker 1:          24:22          You know, she'll use a particularly interesting earthquake from a psychological point of view of, first of all, of course it's very large, a magnitude 8.8. Uh, so we would call a great earthquake where we use great in terms of the wow factor, if you will. Uh, it did kill 700 people, thereabouts. It caused billions, tens of billions of dollars worth of damage. So the economic impact in Chile, he was going to be severe. Uh, but we don't get a magnitude 8.8 very often. The only reason, by the way, there weren't more casualties and chelay and more damage and chill a's that the earthquake was off the coast. It was in the subduction zone. It generates an Ami as we saw. Uh, but it wasn't a direct hit. Uh, but being anywhere close to an 8.8 is enough of a hit to be dangerous. And that's what happened in Chile. But it was the result of a subduction zone.

Speaker 1:          25:13          It's part of what a seismologist call this certain Pacific seismic belt earthquake belt. It's what's colloquially known as the Pacific Ring of fire. Uh, that's actually a great name because indeed the Pacific is rimmed is ringed by these subduction zones. When a subduction zone means that the heavier, denser crust of the Pacific Ocean basin is essentially diving under the lighter, less dense crust of the continence surrounding, um, and as it dives underneath that it sticks and slips and causes earthquakes. Um, roughly 70 or 80% of the world's biggest earthquakes occur. And the Pacific Ring of fire, it's, you know, it's a gigantic source of tectonic energy of earthquake energy. Uh, the other interesting thing about that, by the way, and the reason it's called the ring of fire is because, uh, as he's plates dive down underneath the lighter continent pieces of the melt, and that melt becomes magma that just drives up through what we call the mantle and the crust and creates volcanoes.

Speaker 1:          26:19          So it's, it's kind of part of a, a, a, uh, an ecological recycling mechanism going on. You're taking old crust, throwing it out, sending it down the subduction zone, recycling it into new material, just like you throw a paper bag into the garbage or the recycling bin. Um, so that's the basics of the tectonic activity. Uh, these earthquakes tend to be very large because, uh, these are, uh, large plates. The continence present a significant barrier to subduction in many cases. Uh, and it takes a long time for stress to build up. One interesting thing is that we knew about this, this problem in Chile of course for a long time. And of course the Chileans who have an extraordinarily advanced and professional capacity to deal with earthquakes, uh, knew about this as well. But, uh, 20 or 30 years ago, using very simple components of the plate tectonic theory, uh, this particular area was identified as a so called seismic gap, a place where an earthquake was basically overdue. Uh, couldn't predict it, but we could forecast it. And that's what in some sense, save Chile.

Speaker 1:          27:30          Now, large earthquakes do strange things. Um, uh, of course what an earthquake does is, uh, in addition to breaking the ground, it actually moves big crustal blocks around. And when it does that, it shifts the distribution of mass of the earth. Now, uh, because this wasn't an asteroid or a comet hitting the earth and causing all these vibrations, the earth has to conserve its angular momentum and the way the earth conserves its angular momentum when crustal blocks shift like that is to change the rate of rotation and to slightly shift the axis of rotation. It can be calculated, but it really isn't measurable. On the other hand, if you're being paid by the microsecond, maybe it's something that you might worry about. Uh, but the interesting thing is that we can calculate it. Not that it is in fact something we got to worry about a hand.

Speaker 1:          28:31          He's a different kind of an animal, but it, it, it pays to think about what's really happening around South America. Uh, the Chilean event, a subduction event, uh, was a seduction of a piece of the Pacific plate in this case called the Nazca plate, but a piece, a smaller plate going underneath. I know he Chile underneath the Pacific Ring of fire. And so this is a case where the continent and the Pacific Ocean are sliding, are, are converging against each other in the Pacific diving down. Because it, because it's denser. But if you look at the northern and southern parts of South America, picture it in your mind. Um, you've got the Caribbean to the north. Of course you've got the Scotia seat of the south between South America and aunt artica. And those are two very interesting plates. Uh, you know, in some sense he can think about those plates as resulting from the squirt of material in geologic time going around South America.

Speaker 1:          29:30          So if you can't sub duct this stuff, you can't get everything underneath South America through subduction. That stuff has to go someplace and it goes north and south and sort of squirts around. And the Caribbean plate is one of these plates. I've got squirted through the gap between North and South America. Uh, of course it's, it's a vast simplification, but it's actually the way we, we teach it. It's kind of a fun thing to think about. Um, and so that the Caribbean is actually itself a small plate. Um, it is a significant part of plate tectonics. It was will recognize as a plate, uh, but it's been basically squirting past South America between North and South America, going from west to east and it's moving at a little less than an inch a year relative to North America. Now, the unfortunate thing for Haiti is that for geologic reasons, Haiti lies along the northern boundary.

Speaker 1:          30:27          And because this is a squirt boundary going from west to east, uh, that is what we call a strike slip fault. It's a fault that moves sideways. There's some complexities to that, but that fault was also recognized as being capable of supporting a magnitude seven or greater earthquake. Actually 7.2, uh, in fact, that forecast was made in the professional literature in 2008, two years ago. Um, and, and we've known for about 20 years at that fault was dangerous anyway. That wasn't a subduction earthquake. That was a sliding earthquake and sliding earthquakes strikes slipper earthquakes or dangerous also for a number of reasons. Uh, first of all, they tend not to be as large as a subduction earthquake, but it can be large enough. Uh, they also, in this particular case, they occurred on land and unfortunately the, it was almost a direct hit on port-au-prince.

Speaker 1:          31:21          The earthquake itself was shallow, which increases the amount of vibration that people on the surface feel. Uh, and it was very close to major population centers. So if you will, it was sort of the perfect storm of bad effect. Uh, even if Chile had good building codes and good construction, I think we would have seen tens of thousands of casualties anyway, very difficult to deal with an earthquake of that sort, but it was a different kind of an animal. Um, we've looked at the Chilean earthquake in many ways and we continue to do so. In fact, there are a number of conferences coming up in the next few days, uh, to try to move to the next phase of Chili rebuilding and sort of essentially make the, the rebuilding of Chili more risk conscious, not just for earthquakes, but for the storm's coming up and the annual storm season, the annual hurricane season and concomitant landslides and other natural hazards.

Speaker 1:          32:17          Um, but you know, trying to understand these, uh, earthquakes on land, these strikes of earthquakes, it's a very complex problem. Uh, and one of the things that were very worried about in Haiti is that this earthquake may have stressed parts of the fault that did not rupture on January 12th. Uh, you know, when a, when an earthquake happens, it doesn't zip open the whole fault and only sips open this case about a 40 kilometer segment of it. And there's still stuff on each side that did not rupture well, that stuff may have been overstressed. That piece of the fault may have been overstressed. And so the potential for an earthquake on those segments may actually have increased. That again, is a computer model. It's something that we're working on. Uh, it is hard to predict, uh, but it is something that as a forecast ought to play into the way Haiti's being rebuilt. Um, Chile, we could do the same thing, but to be honest, uh, Chile, apart from the economic damage and the economic recovery, Chile has a, a good capacity to deal with future earthquakes and the outcomes of this earthquake. With Haiti. Uh, I hope that the international community will work with the Haitians to build that capacity so that they can monitor the potential for these future earthquakes.

Speaker 1:          33:51          Well, you know, obviously the public has a great interest in earthquake happens and so we do our best, best we can. Uh, the questions tend to be repetitive. Um, almost always we get a question from somebody about whether they can come see the Richter scale. Do we have an example of the Richter scale? Uh, the Richter scale is a mathematical calculation. In fact, psychologists don't use it anymore. The only reason we give a rector of magnitude, frankly, is for the press and the media. But we have much better ways of measuring the energy of an earthquake now. But the second question that's cropped up and, um, it's fascinating in its own right, is that, uh, the first time I heard it, I thought it was a fluke, uh, but I've heard it so many times since Haiti that I wonder what's going on. And that is, are these earthquakes related to global warming?

Speaker 1:          34:39          Uh, I'm serious about that. I, I'd say that most of the press and most of the public that have called in that, that didn't have specific domain knowledge, uh, has asked us that question. Uh, we also get questions whether, you know, uh, 2012 is coming a couple of years early. Uh, we get that sort of thing. It's just the end of days. But I think it speaks to something more interesting, which is that, uh, earthquakes and major disasters, uh, have a certain impact on the public consciousness. And I think earthquakes more so, or even volcanic eruptions more so than, than anything else. Uh, you know, we get a major hurricane, a few major hurricanes every year. We get floods every year. Uh, their major disasters that cause more norms, norms, amount of economic damage and casualties. Uh, but yet we hear about them relatively often. And so we kind of think of that as kind of background.

Speaker 1:          35:38          This is what the earth is doing to us. But earthquakes, especially major ones, are relatively rare. We get a few major ones that decade, uh, particularly ones with huge numbers of casualties and the concept of an earthquake, that it shakes the firmament, that, that, that it removes your footing, that it could destroy everything in a blink of an eye. And that it is unpredictable, that it just happens. Uh, even if you're rational in a scientific way, uh, even if you're a rational and even a theological sort of way, you get to, it has to have some impact. Um, you know, the, the response, the scientific response to the Chilean earthquake, all the modulator, it a bit by the damage and by the casualties still was this is a major earthquake. We've got to look at this as well as we can because we only get a couple of shots of decades.

Speaker 1:          36:34          Look at it. So now there are teams of scientists and lots of instrumentation going to Chile. Uh, but when you get down to Haiti or something like Haiti, uh, when you get a directed on a capital city, when the bulk of the nation is affected, where you have damaged that far exceeds, uh, their economic ability to come back. Uh, coupled with the fact that an earthquake literally moves the ground on which you cited a, you start asking basic questions like, should I even be here? Should I be living here? Do I have to move? What is, what is the future of my country? What does the future of my city? And those are the sorts of questions that I think have such a big impact on the public that, uh, by necessity I think we've got to talk about them. We've got to talk about what it means.

Speaker 1:          37:31          I think science is somewhat ill equipped to do that. We, we quantify everything. We enumerate the energies, the displacements, the ground motion. Uh, we have, uh, we have technology and we have lingo, but none of this relates to somebody who's asking the question. Uh, my house was destroyed. Where should I move? Uh, and it relates of course in a very quantitative, scientific way. But how do you, how do you approach that person? How do you assure them that the situation has a rational response? And I don't think we have a good way to deal with that. So a lot of the questions we were getting and a lot of the, uh, the thinking that generated, uh, had to do with these central questions of what does this mean in particularly for the future of Haiti? But what does this mean when we talk about taking steps to mitigate against future tragedy, future disasters, not just for earthquakes.

Speaker 1:          38:32          So for the other major natural disasters as well. And uh, to me that, and too many of us, I should say, uh, it's not that we haven't thought about this before, but it seems to me to be an area, not just of research, but of so sort of a way to link directly to the public directly to the people who need to understand what it is we're doing as scientists. Uh, you know, I could, I could make the same sort of arguing about climate change for example, but, uh, earthquake serve, I use a phrase, and I don't mean to use it lightly, but, uh, earthquake service training days for the major environmental disasters, major environmental stresses that our planet faces. And if we can begin to address how we relate to the public, how we provide assurance, how we, uh, help the public to understand what it is that happening in them.

Speaker 1:          39:31          If we can understand how to do that for major earthquakes or major hurricanes a, then perhaps we can do something about stuff that's even more merger, the major more in the future, more emergent, uh, more probabilistic, uh, where we actually might have a chance in modifying our behavior to do something about it. So what I've taken away from this interaction from Haiti and it's, and Chile and I must've been, it's not new to this earthquake. We've had it before with the Indonesian earthquake and the Indian Ocean tsunami. Uh, we've seen it in earthquakes going as far back as the 80s and the 70s, and places like Armenia and China. And so on. But what we've taken away from this, um, is that there's a conversation that scientists have to have with the public that the public will regard as deeply meaningful, which means we can't just throw our results over the fence. We can't just stick with our technical journals. There's gotta be some other mechanism. And in my view, I think universities where, uh, we ascribed to liberal thinking, the small l liberal, uh, you know, we ought to better, it'd be a good place to do it. Uh, and I, I think the universities have that kind of role to play beyond the roles that governments and other social institutions play.

Speaker 1:          41:04          Yeah, no. Uh, it's the rarest seismologists as hasn't experienced an earthquake. We call them theoreticians, by the way. Um, but, uh, yeah, I've experienced earthquakes, uh, nothing larger than about a magnitude six. Um, and of course I've been an aftershock zones where magnitude fours and fives are fairly, fairly frequent, uh, and you take steps to deal with it. Uh, but it's very difficult for me to imagine what it would be like in an 8.8. I mean we, or even a 7.0, that was a direct hit. Uh, I personally feel fortunate that I haven't been in that. And I sometimes joke with my colleagues, that's why I work in New York and not in California. But on the other hand, um, you know, we understand earthquakes in the abstract and the visceral feel of an earthquake is something that perhaps might contribute to the conversation we need to have with the public. And maybe there ought to be a program to get a lot of seismologists into earthquake zones that they can understand what it's like. I'm, I'm only half of specious there. Uh, but to experience an earthquake is to know what it means to somebody who may not be a seismologist, who has a house, has just been destroyed, who has a livelihood that has disappeared, uh, and has a government that's in shambles. And, uh, maybe all we can do is extrapolate, but I think it's, it's something necessary to think about.
