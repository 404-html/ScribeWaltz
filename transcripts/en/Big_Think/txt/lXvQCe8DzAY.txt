Speaker 1:          00:09          I think a system like hello health could definitely encourage more people to go into primary cabs. So however, you know, for the past at least 10 years, about 5% of doctors have been going into primary care. Um, most high performing health care systems in the world, uh, have about 75% primary care doctors in 25% specialists and America. Um, whereabouts exactly opposite. Uh, we have 75% specialists and we're about two generations of doctors behind the curve on this one. So, um, it, once boomers retire or die, uh, primary care sort of dead with them. Um, which is unfortunate because that's what, you know, that's what sort of controls your experience and your health. Um, that's the person that you should be able to depend on. Um, but right now, I mean, specialists are making double, triple, quadruple, uh, as much as, as primary care doctors. So, you know, and seeing like half as many patients. So what's the incentive for doctors to go into primary care? Um, there's not much, uh, hello health, a system like hello health, uh, that encourages and pays primary care doctors for communication. And pays them more on par with, with, um, specialists would absolutely I think work. Uh, then there are other issues where, you know, the medical sort of institutions devalue the, uh, art talent of primary care in exchange for, you know, the big bad neurosurgeon, um, respect they get.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Um, I don't know, that's going to be really interesting. I mean that's the kind of stuff I'm sort of thinking about right now. Um, what I think is most interesting about the death of primary care and the con and this then the rise of the Internet as well. Um, when you think about it, um, the Internet connecting me with information and connecting me with patients is actually doing something really, really interesting to, uh, the practice of medicine. Um, you spend about one hour a year with doctors and about 8,000, 765 without doctors. So what does that mean to your life? Well, doctors aren't the cure all for your health. I mean, you are right. So, I mean, you're sort of like the CEO of your own body and your doctor is a sort of a consultant, you call it every once in a while, right?

Speaker 1:          02:43          So that basically means, um, there are a ton of tools that are just now springing up, uh, that connect us with good information that's relevant to you as well as connect us with other patients who are having similar problems as you. So, um, I hope that the Internet can prevent, uh, office visits, especially primary care visits, uh, and help people take care of themselves better is tools. Now, um, you know, you can connect with doctors via video chat. Uh, I think those tools have serious issues there because nobody really uses video chat with strangers and who are the doctors that are on video chat where they're seeing patients in our office, you know. Um, but I think that there are opportunities to build so to systems like this, the issue is how do you, when people need a prescription maybe, um, for say antibiotics, uh, and I can't really be done over the Internet, uh, with today's sort of laws and regulations.
