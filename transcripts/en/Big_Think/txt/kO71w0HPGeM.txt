Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, I've been very, very involved with star, uh, since, since I first came because the mission there was to transform it from a tabloid into a glossy magazine, which is totally necessary because after us came out, it really changed the landscape of celebrity reporting and tabloids as we're vulnerable because as newspapers, young people aren't for a long time, haven't been reading newspapers and that trend has been continuing and tablets are really a newspaper. So, um, star need to star needed to get a younger audience and needed to go more upscale in order to attract advertising, which it couldn't carry is a tabloid. And so, uh, American media decided that they were going to need this transition. It never been done before and Anna, it's never going to be done again. There's no other tablet that really is convertible. So that was a real challenge. But I was very interested in that challenge and I came in and we did that and it took, I would say it took a good four years to really get accepted.

Speaker 1:          01:13          It's only been in the last, this last year that I feel we've really patched past the tipping point. We've gained this whole new younger audience. We've got the advertisers to except the magazine and advertising's up 26%. And so it's really in the last year I've been able even know I was, I the other magazine I've been fairly involved with for a while it's shape because it really needed to also transition. And a couple of years ago it brought in a new editor and you creative director and we redesigned and and read is we re um, kind of not just did a physical redesigned but kind of really reformat it the way we were presenting the editorial so and the text. And so, and that's actually worked out very, very well. They're having their best year ever now too. So, but until this last year I really didn't get a chance to, to oversee and focus on any other magazines. And now because star has had that tipping point, I've been able to pull back from it and not be so involved in the day to day. And I've been much more involved with, I'm working on country weekly, which is also needed to be redesigned. I don't have updated, uh, it's fun magazine, natural health, men's fitness, and even getting a little bit involved with the myth that the men's muscle titles, which is very brand new to me. So, and then I work a lot also on doing still a lot of the marketing and advertising
