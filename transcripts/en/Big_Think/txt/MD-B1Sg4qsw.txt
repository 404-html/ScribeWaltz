Speaker 1:          00:03          It's clear that in terms of optimistic positivity is a predictor of mortality. It does predict mortality and it predicts mortality when you control for lots of different, uh, self reported health problems, depression scales that have been validated, self reported health. If you're interested in predicting things from optimism or optimistic positivity, you want to look at what predicts it. And that's what I was focusing on in that first paper. So we have three papers already started. Basically we're looking at, uh, explicit measures of optimism as well as these were using wording effects, um, to measure what we calling him. Implicit measures of, uh, close to perceptual optimism and pessimism. That positive wording bias is a form of optimism. But if you're looking at the world in more positive ways, you're taking information in and you're framing it in positive ways and you're seeing it so you're reacting to it and positive ways sometimes in the way that you, you don't even know that you're doing right.

Speaker 1:          01:09          It's so subtle. It's like a wording effect that you couldn't say that you, you know, it's not like I'm asking you, are you responding this way to these words of that, those ways, that words, we can detect it statistically over people. So when you're asking people to say things about themselves on a survey, for example, you're asking them, you know, are you a good person? Are you a competent person? Um, there's a whole series of questions you can ask them. Some of them will, uh, already positively some of them and negatively. And usually those wording, uh, those survey questions are, uh, used to, uh, to create scales of things like self esteem, self efficacy mastery. There's a latent variable. The idea is that there's something out there. It's latent and it explained some variance in how people answer these questions. And we're putting that together with some measures that acts.

Speaker 1:          02:03          Pete, ask people about how optimistic they are using language explicitly and saying that together those things create this phenomenon. And we're saying that the phenomenon goes deep, uh, to level of perception is itself a form of, uh, of stratification. If is there something about optimism that's, uh, that's a resource that we can understand as a psychological good, like happiness, right? And so if it's stratified in the population, how is it an associated with other kinds of stratification in column and, and, and so forth. Education. And so, uh, you know, you saying, well, class, the real interesting one is class, right? Everybody wants to know, you know, or pull yourself up by your bootstraps. You know, think positively. You'll be successful if you're optimistic, you will be successful. Right? But of course, if it's successful, you're gonna be optimistic. So there's the reverse thing. And so taking a class and looking at classes, really the really interesting part of that I want to get to, right. And I think that's an interesting question because there's a lot of theory around sociology and emotions around, uh, the, the idea that expectations are created, the ability to meet expectations generates energy. That energy is what allows people to do things.

Speaker 1:          03:25          It's something that emotional energy and then, uh, it replicates itself.

Speaker 2:          03:32          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          03:32          So people are convinced to be optimistic, especially in the middle classes.

Speaker 2:          03:38          Okay.

Speaker 1:          03:39          And if they're not able to achieve those expectations, then that energy goes down and they become dissatisfied. There's some difference with cohorts. And now I see with race difference, I see cohort differences when you were born. And that makes sense in terms of things like civil rights movement and what you experienced in your life, right? And, and, and, and your hopes and dreams and, and so forth. So, um, the question I'm looking at now first, of course, is, well, you can't change, you know, not many. There's not much way that your optimism or pessimism going to change your gender in a statistically significant way. You know, night change. People can change their gender, but it's not gonna Change your age. It's not gonna Change your birth cohort and, you know, race, very small effects. So I'm looking at those things that influence, that can be understood as causes of, and they can't be reversed causality first.

Speaker 1:          04:34          So that's what I've been doing. And, uh, we ran these models and what do we see? Well we did. We saw that when you look at all these things, race, birth, cohort, age and gender together, that there's these curves and the curves are interesting. They start off with men being more optimistic than women. There's a convergence in midlife and then a divergence. Again, we're metamor optimistic, optimistic, positivity, higher optimistic positivity than women, right? We see your race trends. Um, and uh, and those vary by cohort. People born before 1932 whites. I'm more optimistic than blacks for all of these people. Um, optimism, optimistic, positivity declines with age, right? So we're seeing these trends over time, declining with age, but whites and more optimistic than blocks and it's declining. But for people born after 1932, we see blacks having higher levels of optimists. Dick Putz, these Americans, right?

Speaker 1:          05:32          All US data, uh, high higher levels of optimistic positivity than whites over the over age period. They are still declining. That's optimistic positivity. What about a pessimistic negativity, right? Uh, blacks consistently higher than whites, um, in, in this past pessimistic negativity across cohorts. So we can look at those things and say, you know, people who got more schooling past high school, you know, they were optimistic when we first measured them and, and, and they were more likely to get some schooling and we can try to control for other things and say it's, it's really the optimism that's influencing the schooling. We could also try to say, you know, their, their class background is influencing their optimism and pessimism and I think that's, we have run better position to say something about that. We can look at them over 25 years. We don't have what you were born with.

Speaker 1:          06:28          Right. We don't have, when you started off with, right, we do have what your parents, what income your parents made, you know, what school you, you know, how much schooling you got and so forth. I was thinking about this was that I really came of age. I be, I graduated high school in 1976 as the great society programs were in place, there was really opportunity for people who base, I went to some of the high, uh, with that time it was called Slummerville. Leno wasn't very, it's a place now that's very, uh, houses worth millions of dollars and so forth. But at that time, it was a working class neighborhood. Uh, I wasn't a great students. I got into university, I did well in university because when we option I saw was joining the air force or the Army and, uh, nonprofit. I'm a professor, right? So I was thinking about my career in the con and in terms of, uh, this project and the opportunities I've had.

Speaker 1:          07:28          And I mean, I, I'm a pessimistic person, but I took advantage of the opportunities because I saw that there were doors. The Way Society is structured is that there's doors and if you can jump through them, it doesn't really matter what your skill is, that much, their divisions are fine grained. And if you can get through that door and you get all sorts of resources and then you're gonna get to the next level. So I became an optimistic about academia, uh, in a way that allowed me to continue to put my nose to the grindstone and not to think too much about it because the resources were there. Right. I made the decision. Yeah. It, but really the point I wanted to make was these policies, these programs, kids don't have them anymore. Like now I teach and uh, and uh, the kids see that the middle is getting hollowed out.

Speaker 1:          08:19          Right. And they're anxious. Mental health problems and university have gone through the roof, right. And, uh, university don't know how to do with it. Um, so, and I can see why they have, because the opportunities aren't there and the kids realize that there's a bifurcation, right. There's a make it a break. Um, so, uh, I look at myself, I look at my own history and I say, I, I was the intel end of the baby boom. And you know, I profited economically, uh, in some way, socially in some ways, but you know, in other ways, maybe not. Uh, and so I look at these generational differences now and I can understand now you should, going back to business, right? Going in, somebody gets a job in the GIG economy, right? What's their mentality? Like there's another gig down the road. I'll make it work to the extent I can, or, or has it become like, is this has to really work? And if this doesn't work, I'm screwed. Right. My career, I don't really know. I don't think anybody really knows what's happening. And these areas that you're interested in terms of work, you know, and what the possibilities are, are there, there's some interesting questions that you have to ask.
