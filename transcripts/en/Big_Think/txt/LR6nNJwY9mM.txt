Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, the violin is, for me, it's one of my voices. Um, it's one of the voices that express my thoughts, my feelings, my understandings of different things in different matters. Um, it tries to communicate different messages, different ideas. Um, different discoveries, um, different beliefs, um, different interpretations. Um, many different things. Um, violence is really for me to voice. My violin was made in 1734. It's made by granaries still jaisal. I'm one of the two. I'm most notable acres for the instrument of the violin. Um, and I've had it for a little over 10 years now. Um, it's Italian, it's made like a starter as violent or other ordinary as violence meeting Cremona in Italy and um, it's difficult to say, you know, what's the violin and what's me because it's the combination that really makes it very unique. Um, another player playing the exact same violin, um, would sound very differently.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Um, I might play another instrument. I'm not the one that I have, but might be something else and I would still sound like me also, but it's really a combination. And also, I do think that the violent is a living being. Um, first of all, it's extremely sensitive to humidity and to heat temperature changes. Um, it's very, very capricious. It's very, I'm temperamental. Um, it's, it gets grouchy. It's, you know, I'm meant to a good mood. Takes regular maintenance. That's like going to violin doctor. Um, but I actually love this instrument and it just feels, it just feels like this is the partner that I want. Um, and I'm very, very grateful for having access to such a great instrument. It is. It doesn't matter food place on it. It is a great instrument, but it's something about this particular great instrument that I'm just so I'm attracted to. And I think it's a lot to do with chemistry as well. It's not something you know, that, um, one can say as well, if you put this element into this violent, then this person's going to like it better is I think just a combination of known and unknown things that make it very, very special.

Speaker 1:          03:01          I consider it a partner. I don't think of it as an extension of myself and people like to think that, um, you know, well, a violin could be like a part of your body or a part of you. I think it's a wonderful partner. Um, I do give it that little distance that it's something that lives with that objective.
