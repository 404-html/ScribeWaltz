Speaker 1:          00:04          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:06          as important as it is to cross disciplines to transgress boundaries, whether it's science and art or even boundaries within science, it is very tough to do in practice. It is very tough to interact with someone who speaks a different language, who uses different acronyms, who had tax problems from different perspectives. So I think we have to do everything possible to not only encourage this to give out more grants that funded, uh, funding is of course a huge, huge problem for interdisciplinary research. Um, but also I think begin to make a serious, rigorous case for these kinds of interactions. I think too often it's easy to write off interdisciplinary collaborations is kind of feel good exercises when I think the research and literature may clear that there's often a really, really, if not the most productive way of coming together way of collaborating. And in a sense we see the most when we are on the outside of a field looking in, when my favorite examples of this is the website innocentive.com which is, it's a crowdsourcing website used by various fortune 100 companies.

Speaker 2:          01:06          So Eli Lilly helped develop it. But you know, Pfizer uses it. Proctor and gamble uses the General Electric Kraft foods companies with huge, huge r and d budgets and the billions of dollars, but they do is they post their hardest scientific problems on this website. The problems their own scientists can solve and they catch a reward to it. So if you can solve a problem for g a chemistry problem, say maybe you'll get $1 million, maybe it will be $50,000 who knows? But, but you know, that's the incentive part of incentive. Now, the first surprisingly about [inaudible] dot com is that it works about anywhere between 30 to 50% of these problems are solved within six months. Some are solved within days of being posted online. So I mean, this is kind of surprising, I think, because here problems that these huge companies can solve and yet some stranger sitting on his couch in his pajamas while eating fruit loops is solving them, making it look easy.

Speaker 2:          01:55          Now what's most interesting but incentives, how these problems get solved. And this is work by cream and Connie at Harvard business school, he is shown that let's say ge posted chemistry problem online. Then prom is almost never solved by another chemist. Instead it's all biomolecular molecular biologist by biophysicists, by someone who knows enough to understand the terms of the question but doesn't know so much that they run into the exact same stumbling blocks as the chemist back at Ge. So this is a real testament to the virtues of outsider thinking and outsider creativity. And I think we have to realize that this is, this is a real thing that we have to incorporate in, you know, in you know, in everyday work, you know, in the everyday world. Cause I think we come with this tacit assumption that if you're struggling with a really hard problem, you got to give to the guy who knows the most to those expert insiders. But sometimes when it comes to creativity and innovation, sometimes knowledge is a blind spot. Sometimes we can know too much, sometimes we have our best thoughts when we're working with someone. In a different field, tackling a problem just beyond our area of expertise. Um, so I think that's, that's a very practical case for interdisciplinary collaboration.

Speaker 3:          03:03          Okay.
