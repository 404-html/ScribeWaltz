Speaker 1:          00:09          Surrounds us so profound, 90 to 98 percent, that eight percent difference from thing you read to the your raid is dark energy or dark matter. We don't know what it is. We don't know what 98 percent of the universe is and this wonderful man Einstein, this wonderful man who imagined the scientific theories, much like the Greeks who said, all right, if you cut something in half, you've got to have the cut that half and you keep going down the line. You must come to the end and they said, we'll call it an Adam, and that's how they made their scientific discoveries through the logic of imagination. Whereas we have tools to dimly dimly see into the physical nature dimly see a law. Yeah. That seems to be a law. Wait a minute. There's something here that counteracts that law, so just like our diets, the pyramid, carbohydrates, a little bit of meat. One day is 180 degrees reverse. No, no, no. What we meant was protein and a little bit of carbohydrate. Exactly. One hundred 80 degrees different in your diet. That's what's happening in science all the time. There's a wonderful line science scientists spread rumors.

Speaker 1:          01:45          We know everything is unified. We know if we use our imagination like the Greeks, we look around us and we say the whole world is unified. Electrically. Adams thing matter. There's got to be a operating the thing that has to be managed in some way. It's their. Everything follows a logic. We had these little instruments that peer into the universe. We're seeing a SPEC. We're seeing a dust. Mote wouldn't the theory of everything. Maybe you discover that as you die, maybe as you die, you though there's the theory of everything. Boom, and you're dead.
