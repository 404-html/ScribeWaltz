Speaker 1:          00:04          I would say the biggest challenge

Speaker 2:          00:09          todd as a woman in science is being a mom. It's really hard. It's very hard work having children. Um, and I tell kids this all the time and they say, what's the hardest thing you've ever done? Because I've done so many space missions and Hubble and pro your big project. I like all the hardest thing is being a mom. Kids like 24, seven, you can't stop it. It's always there. And uh, as a scientist it's hard because you know, my particular field of science and most fields of science require quite a bit of dedication to whether it's laboratory work or in my case telescopic work. I'm where I need to go places and do things. Uh, having high quality daycare is by far the most important thing you can do when your kids are little. You know, I, I, when I relocated, I spent more time looking for daycare, then I did looking for a house, it was much more important to have good daycare and I was fortunate to find high quality daycare where I just totally trusted it.

Speaker 2:          01:07          Then my kids were great. They the absolutely fantastic kids doing super jobs now and you know, they're wonderful. But you know, I had to spend a lot of time and energy doing that. I also learned you must rely on friends and family to help you out. You can't do it on your own. You know, there's this people like y'all, you know, how do you do it? I'm like, well my neighbors, my mom helps, you know, I just rely on other people. That's the way it has to be. Otherwise you just go nuts. Uh, so it's, it's a tough balancing act and I also learned that there is no such thing as balance that, you know, on any individual day your life is completely skewed one way or the other. One day you're like dealing with child crises and you're just coping. And the next day, you know, you may be dealing with a work crisis and just dealing with that over the long run, you have to find sort of the right balance, but you can't expect it to balance. It ended the individual moment cause it won't. And once you learn to give that up lunch and learn to give up the myth of balance, you know, you can be a much more relaxed.

Speaker 1:          02:14          Personally, I would encourage anybody who's interested in any kind of, and

Speaker 2:          02:24          if science engineering, math field to go after that. You know, I am not about telling people, become astronomers. We don't need a lot of astronomers, but what I want to avoid is that young young woman coming along who was absolutely fascinated in biochemistry, but she's told, oh no, biochemistry. That's the guy's field. That's wrong. You know, and I, I, the best compliment I ever had was a young person who I just met standing in line to go to a concert. It was like two years after the shoemaker levy nine thing where I had been in the news a lot and this guy and all, we were talking, waiting to get into the concert and he said, you don't have love. I am. I introduced myself, Heidi, it's like you, Heidi, Heidi humble, the astronomer. I'm like, yeah, that's me. He's like, ah, you're the reason I became a biologist.

Speaker 2:          03:14          I said, Oh yeah. How'd that happen? He said, well, when you did that comment, crash thing, I just thought that was so cool and I had really slacked off. I dropped out of college and I was just, you know, being a slacker. But I was so excited by that, that I went back to college and I took astronomy courses and I said, well, that's pretty cool. And he said, yeah, but I hated astronomy. I'm like, well, it's not for everyone. He said, I love biology. And then went on to get my phd in biology and like, that's it. That's what it's all about. You know? That's my message is don't be discouraged by anything anybody tells you. You know? In my case, that's the science thing. And I just ignored people who said, oh, girls don't do that and what blah, blah, blah. I just went ahead and did it anyway. You know? Lack of fear, stupidity. I don't know why I just kept doing it, but to tell young people, don't listen to those folks that you can't.

Speaker 1:          04:08          If you want to do it. That's the message.
