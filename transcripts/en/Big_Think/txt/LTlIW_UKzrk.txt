Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08          I first and foremost a Christian. And that means not only that I draw my inspiration from the Bible, but also for me. I'm an Orthodox Christian, so it's also from the great creed, the apostles, creed, creed, and so on. Um, and that is a bedrock for my life. I, and I wouldn't say that I'm a great Christian in the sense that I can always do what I think are what to do, but I tend to, I once read a book, uh, by an episcopal done. Yes, there are fiscal sponsor and what triggered what sort of government, episcopal nun who said that, um, you can't see the future and it's, you can't tell what God wants to do five years from now, but if you look carefully, we take the time to get general, tell what you're supposed to do right now. Uh, and I try to think of things that way.

Speaker 2:          00:52          I try to think about what I should do right now. I tend to be a thoughtful person. I tend to be someone. I don't make snap judgments. I like to take time to think things over. Um, and then want to make decisions. I tend to stick to them but they tend to be social. I made over a period of time. We live in a world that encourages snap judgments, that rewards thinking fast and I don't think that makes for very good decision. Making. My wife I should say is also a great inspiration to me. Um, uh, my wife is not only a Christian but someone who tries to live our faith and really thinks very hard about the right thing to do. She currently is involved in issues that I think are of great importance. She's apprentice lawyer as I am. She's working with Jones defense one as well as being corporate law.

Speaker 2:          01:31          Before that she now affiliated with a couple of think tanks and she's interested in the future of mothering in, in America and in the world. And she's interested in the commodification of children in two senses. Both the, the, the sense in which we might say the commercialization of childhood advertising aimed at children trying to create little consumers and also commodification of different sense of the notion of designer babies. And what does that say about humanity, about us, and about our future? She doesn't go into these things as a shrill advocate. She goes to these things to try to understand the direction we're moving and to try to encourage conversations about these directions. What I like about her approach is exactly that, that she wants to encourage conversation when she wants to do is create a world which people think about issues and then talk about them as opposed to go on television. You rant and rave about them. I think that's the kind of work that I wish more advocates would do. It's kind of work that I used to
