Speaker 1:          00:05          I would define compassion in a nutshell, as a natural sense of concern that arises in us in the face of someone who was a need or someone who's in pain and accompanied by a kind of a wishing to see the relief or end of that situation and wanted to do something about it. So it's compassionate. It's not just an emotional reaction. There is also a more motivational kind of element which makes us want to do something about the situation. One of the interesting thing about our contemporary modern society is that I'm given the highly competitive nature of society and also the way in which we're bringing up our children and the way in which we ourselves grew up, which involved huge amount of evaluation and judgment and comparison across with others from a very early age. Um, we have kind of internalized a certain kind of way of being in the world and perceiving our relationship with others.

Speaker 1:          01:05          And that dynamic has created a certain kind of, you know, inhibitions against our natural compassionate instinct. So, and these inhibitions really take primarily in the form of fear. So for example, many people worry and I'm afraid that if they are too kind and compassionate, that other people will take advantage of them. They will see them as pushover or weak or losers. So that's one type of fear that we bring. I'm not the type of fear that we bring is that, um, you know, because in popular understanding of compassion, it's so dominated by compassion as an emotion, kind of a soft heart and tender heart and so on. So people worry that if they allow their compassionate and kinder instinct to become more dominant in their way of interacting with the world and others, you know, somehow it might undermine their more rational, tougher aside so that they may not be able to succeed in the life and compete.

Speaker 1:          02:09          That's another type of fear. And then sometimes, uh, in intimate relations that particularly between parents and children on the part of the parents, sometimes we also worry that if we were to kind to our children, you know, we might be spoiling them, you know, we, they might become overdependent up on us and then somehow we will end up having to do everything for them. So these are various types of fear that we bring into our expression of natural compassionate instinct. And a lot of these are subconscious biases that we bring. You know, people may not necessarily sit down and think that's what I'm going to do, but these are culturally acquired sensibilities and biases, which also makes us suspicious when someone has been kind to us compassionate towards us, we start one wondering, there must be hidden agenda, you know, that that person must want something from me. So it's, I'm very unfortunate. These are various forms of culturally acquired fear that really undermines the expression of what is really natural to our human being, which is the ability to connect with someone and the ability to relate to that person at a deeper level and have a much more open heart hearted kind of interaction.
