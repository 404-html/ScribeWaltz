Speaker 1:          00:05          Which meant it turns out was a very central part of the constitution of the United States. Meaning it's obscure. People don't know about it, but it probably was necessary for the constitution actually to be ratified by the American people. You can see the impeachment clause, and I'm going to explain its content in a moment, but you can see it as, um, part of the American revolution itself in the sense that the revolt against a king who was a leader who had authority over we the people was, um, incomplete. If we didn't have a mechanism by which we could get rid of our leaders, including the president, which was a way of ensuring that we didn't have anything like a monarchy. Now, the way impeachment worked is that in the early American colonies before America was America, we started impeaching, uh, people who were following orders from the king.

Speaker 1:          01:10          And what that meant was that, uh, an abusive authority would be called out by some legislative assembly. And in the initial phase, what would happen would be there just be a vote that the person had abused authority. And then if the thing, uh, fell to completion and this goes back to England, there'd be a trial. And in the trial the person would be convicted of the offense for which impeachment was had and if convicted, the person would be removed from office. So to bring this back to the American structure as a developed after the revolution and after the constitution came into place, and this was thought through with such care in Philadelphia when the constitution was debated, the idea was that if there is a high crime and misdemeanor and we can talk a bit about what that means, or if there's trees in or bribery, then the house of Representatives by majority vote can impeach the president, the vice president, Supreme Court justices, um, members of the cabinet.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And what that means is there's a kind of official, um, judgment that the person has done something very, very bad. And after that, the proceeding moves to the Senate, which is acting like a court and which decides whether to convict, which means to remove the person from office. The house makes the impeachment vote by a majority vote. That doesn't mean anyone has to leave office. It then goes to the Senate, which if it votes by a two thirds majority, uh, to convict on the ground on which the blood say president was impeached, then the person is, uh, as they say about baseballs that are hit very hard, the president has gone. Yes. So, uh, because the word high crimes and misdemeanors seems to mean kind of felonies, high crimes and misdemeanors. The normal current reader would think, oh, is there a crime? If you go back to the 18th century, it's actually a lot more inspiring like that then that and um, uh, kind of fitting with a system that's committed to us self government.

Speaker 1:          03:27          So if there's a crime, let's call it a jaywalking or shoplifting or not paying your income taxes, that's not a high crime or misdemeanor in the constitutional sense. What is meant by high crime and misdemeanor is an abuse of official authority and shoplifting or income tax evasion. That's a crime. It's not an abuse of official authority. If the president of the United States, let's suppose a decides, I'm going to pardon every police officer who shot an African American, that's not itself likely to be a crime. The president has the pardon power, but that is definitely an impeachable offense. In fact, James Madison spoke of abuse of the pardon power as an impeachable offense. If the president of the United States decides I'm going to go on vacation in Paris for the next six months cause it's really beautiful. That's certainly not a crime but it's an impeachable offense. That's an egregious neglect of uh, the authority of the office.

Speaker 1:          04:31          So abusive, the authority of the office, if it's egregious, pardon power example would be one. Um, if the president of starts invading civil liberties in a terrible way by a locking people up for insufficient reason, by going crazy in terms of security measures at airports and borders. And by going crazy, I'm using that as kind of a legal term of art really exceeding the bounds of the reasonable. That is not a crime, but that is an abuse of authority. And there were right back in, uh, the impeachment clause, which is I think first and foremost way of preserving our are our rights and liberties and a way of calling out an authority who has invaded them. Think now about, uh, what the American revolution was fought for. And so I've spent a lot of the last months in the 18th century and uh, uh, the people back then, we're on the impeachment issues and presidential authority issues.

Speaker 1:          05:34          They were off the charts good in the debate in Virginia on whether we should ratify the constitution. One really, um, learned person said, we cannot ratify this constitution and the reason is the pardon power and it was urged by the skeptic. The president could participate in something really sinister with one of his advisors. Then his advisor is in legal trouble and then the president can pardon the person for engaging in illegal or corrupt activity that the president initiated. How can we allow a constitution that has that in it? That's a fair question. And it was stated with great precision as an objection to the constitution as I recall by someone who had actually signed the declaration of independence. And I know that person was at the constitutional convention and refuse to embrace it. James Madison, uh, very quietly responded and he said, I think the gentleman has overlooked something isn't about a sweet way of, uh, responding to someone when the stakes are super high.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Whether we're going to have a constitution is the gentleman is overlooked something. And then Madison explained if the president uses the pardon power to shelter someone who's done something terrible, uh, there's something available on the constitution. Impeachment and Madison actually did his interlocutor one better. The interlocutor was saying, if the president advises something terrible and participates and then, uh, uh, pardons the person. Isn't that awful? Madison said, yes, that's awful. And that's impeachable Madison's words seem to go beyond that to say, if you pardon someone who's, who's done something terrible or one of your own people, that's itself a legitimate grounds for impeachment, which suggested that abusive the pardon power in the words of James Madison, that's an impeachable offense. And with respect to the meaning of the Constitution, uh, it is hazardous to argue with James Madison. The beauty of the impeachment mechanism is its connection with the principle that we have a republican, not a monarchy, which means it puts we the people in charge.

Speaker 1:          08:00          That means that invocation of the impeachment mechanism, whether it's a democratic president, a Republican president, really depends on we the people. So if you think of examples, uh, there was some interest in under President Bush and President Obama, some interest in impeaching them. But I think, you know, thank goodness, uh, we, the people, even if we didn't like either of those presidents, didn't think there was an impeachable offense under President Nixon. By contrast and I believe, um, very unfortunately under president Clinton because he didn't commit an impeachable offense, but under both of them, there was a public demand for getting rid of him on the ground that, uh, President Nixon had, uh, abused his presidential authority to, uh, cover up crimes and also had himself use presidential authority to invade civil rights and civil liberties, uh, that got people, whatever their political affiliation sufficiently charged up that they either, uh, we're willing to go along with those members of the House of Representatives who wanted to impeach Nixon or they fueled that.

Speaker 1:          09:16          In the Clinton case. Uh, there was a thought, and again, perjury and obstruction of justice, which were the charges against President Clinton. There's nothing good about them. They're very bad, but they weren't, in his case, impeachable offenses under the constitution. Nonetheless, people were charged up. A lot of people were charged up. So whether the president is a Democrat or Republican, whether it's president trump or in the future, you know, some, uh, left or center president, if people think that there's something that really is beyond the Pale, and that's not the constitutional tasks, but it's the kind of Colloquia who have getting at the constitutional task beyond the Pale of a legitimate uses of, of authority, then we, the people, um, uh, we're the boss. So the question, who's the boss? Uh, the first three words of the constitution say it, we, the people and the impeachment clause kind of makes that real.
