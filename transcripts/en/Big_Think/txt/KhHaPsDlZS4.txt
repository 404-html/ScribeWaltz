Speaker 1:          00:05          It's very interesting because I have worked with both chimpanzees and dolphins and they're both incredibly intelligent, complex beings and it is difficult to say who is more intelligent. In fact, when you get to the level of working with an animal of that complexity, it's very difficult to, to rank them or to say who is more intelligent than who, uh, it's easier to read chimpanzees because they look like us. They're our closest living relatives and their body language and facial expressions are very much like ours. It's more difficult to read dolphins because they don't have facial expressions. They don't look like us. Um, so, so there is a difference in how we can perceive their intelligence. But I would have to say that having worked with both, they are a strikingly a bright. Both of them.
