Speaker 1:          00:06          Let me outline four different possible explanations one can give and, uh, and I will just leave it, leave it to the audience too, to reflect on, on these four possible explanations for why we've had this extraordinary run of, of, of, of bubbles and busts over the last number of decades. A, the first one, which one might describe as sort of the, uh, the left wing or liberal answer is that it has, it has basically been driven by reckless lending, lack of regulation and greed and that, uh, and that in effect, the entire boom since, uh, the early Reagan years in 1982 was basically driven by, um, by, um, by this escalating leverage that in effect was more fake than rail. And, uh, and that, uh, it is basically come to an end and that, uh, it worked well. It did, but it was basically the fault of the, uh, of the lenders and all kinds of agency problems associated with them.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Um, there's a, there's a second type of political events which is the right wing or conservative answer, which is that it basically was the fault of the borrowers, that they were recklessly borrowing all this money and it was, it was people who were too greedy and buying houses and going on credit and um, and that it was sort of the product of a narcissistic and selfish generation that, uh, was not with short sighted and not thinking about the future. And under that sort of a narrative, you might trace things back to say 19, 68 a and say that was the year that everything went downhill in the u. s and the hippies took over or something, something along those lines. Now I think there's a, it is, of course, the case of these two explanations are not inconsistent and it is possible that a, there were problems with both the lenders and the borrowers and that in some sense, a, there was something about, um, uh, something deeper about the whole political system which have failed to proactively deal with these things.

Speaker 1:          02:03          And just us speaking up, speaking on my, in my own context, uh, you know, it was obvious that there was an insane housing bubble three years ago and you could talk about it, you could scream about it, you could go on CNBC and tell people, uh, there was a housing bubble, they should not buy houses. And it was like shouting into a hurricane. Nobody was willing to listen. And, uh, and there is something about the, um, the nature of these things that is extraordinarily a pro cyclical in a bad way in terms of our political system where, when there is, when there is, when everything's going well, the regulations get loosened, when things are going badly, they get tightened. So that in effect, the political process has had the effect of dampening these bubbles and booms, but actually exacerbating them tremendously. And I think that is going to be one of the real serious challenges we faced in the years ahead in the technology context.

Speaker 1:          02:54          For example, in the late nineties, uh, which, uh, uh, you know, there were obviously tremendous. We dealt with the abuses with Sarbanes Oxley and there've been basically no more. I tech Ipos are virtually no tech Ipos in six years. So we had, we had an excess of boom, the regulators did nothing and then we had an excess of Boston and we had an overreaction and uh, and again you can blame it on special interest groups that are serving the lenders. You can blame it on, on, on the desire of the borrowers to keep the easy money going, but when basically a, both of them and you have to wonder how, how this, how this can better be handled. I think one of the challenges, the, uh, that is happening on a global scale is that the inability of our political system to proactively deal with these bubbles is calling into question the very concept of democratic capitalism.

Speaker 1:          03:49          And I think one of the, one of the challenges in the next, uh, next four to five years is that as sort of a more authoritarian version of capitalism, of the sort that one sees in China will get a lot more appeal. Because the argument will be that it is able to, uh, to resist the, uh, the appeal of, of, of people and special interests groups, uh, and sort of act on behalf of the whole society. And I think the challenge for the next president is going to be to somehow, um, rehabilitate the good name of democratic capitalism. And, uh, it will be, it'll be quite a big challenge. And I certainly hope that whoever becomes president will succeed at that. Let me, let me, however, outline a fourth, a possible explanation for why so many of these bubbles have turned into bus. And this is probably my own, my own personal hobby.

Speaker 1:          04:35          Hoarseness, which is that there's not been enough real growth in the economy and that in some sense, the reason so many of these booms didn't work was that the whole economy was not growing. And this is not a question about finance or politics or regulation or at least not centrally about those, but about science and technology and the rate at which science and technology are progressing. And, uh, and I think sort of one, and you know, while there's incredible hype surrounding tech companies and scientific innovation, the reality has simply not lived up to the hype for a very long time. And, uh, and the, the, you know, the anecdote I would cite as if we were sitting in this room in 1968 and talking about what was the future of the US going to look like in 40 years. Uh, you know, we would have predicted the cation trips to the moon.

Speaker 1:          05:25          I'm a space spaceships on Mars, um, massive increases in productivity. Zerbe on triber, a European writer wrote the American challenge in 1967. He said that by the year 2000, the average person, the US will be working seven hours a day, four days a week and have 13 weeks, a year of paid vacation time. Which, uh, which was a reflection of the incredible growth in productivity that was set to take place by accelerating technology and science and I, and it's gone. Everything's gone the other way. There's not been enough progress. And I think, I think the longterm challenge that I would submit is that we somehow need to, to get that restarted. And it is very, it's not easy. Um, it's, it's, it's broken down for a lot of very complicated reasons, but I think that, that in some sense, um, that's the kind of thing that, that needs to be very much restarted.

Speaker 1:          06:16          If I had a last thought on this is if one had to look at the whole series of bubbles, the one that I think was the central one, perhaps not just in time, but also in importance was the tech bubble of the late nineties. And in some sense when that one turned out to go wrong, it meant that none of them would work because if there was not going to be exponential progress in technology, nothing else made sense and you could leverage up in housing. But eventually housing prices would go down if there was no real growth in the society taking place. And the same. I think it's true of a finance and to a lesser extent of the, uh, the emerging market of the emerging market story. So I think the, I would encourage us to very seriously rethink why there's been so little progress and how that can be accelerated. I think this is certainly one of the great things that a big thing as an impetus for doing.
