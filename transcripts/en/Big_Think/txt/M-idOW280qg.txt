Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:04          curiosity has been often referred to as closing a knowledge gap and this goes back to Berlin's. Work, goes back to a lot of work being done by Lippman and his colleagues presently would distinguish between two forms of curiosity, interest, epistemic curiosity and knowledge gap, curiosity, that probation they call it. The reason that they call it deprivation is because that is has been an argument that if you are curious, there is a certain kind of negative feeling that you experienced before. Your curiosity is satisfied and once you have this answer, you feel a relief and a positive feeling comes over you. We argued that if you are interested and you are searching for more information, that is a rewarding experience and you do not necessarily or you're unlikely to have an adversity feeling except you can have negative feelings develop because you have a problem in your search, but that's different than trying to close the knowledge gap.

Speaker 2:          01:16          The way that I can best demonstrate you, how we consider curiosity and interest to be different is by telling you to think about when you read a detective story. When you read a detective story, the minute you find out that who actually is the murderer, you might not even want to finish your book and compare that to reading glad, say Harry Potter or some really well constructed book that you are not simply trying to find out a knowledge gap. You are interested in many of the characters who are interested in the ideas, you are interested in the relationships and you will keep on reading that book. Not only is the length of time different and the aversion different, but there are also the purpose is is different like when you are interested you, you are searching for a lot of information, not just a specific information to close the knowledge gap.

Speaker 2:          02:10          Now there are some unanswered issues about this. For example, what happens if you have interest in a content, but that is a knowledge gap that you're closing. Is that now different from just being curious and we argued that it is because for example, at a bridge expert who loves playing bridge, he is reading a book with many, many puzzles. Okay? Solving beach hands. He goes and solves and knowledge gap and then continuous going onto other questions, other puzzles, because he has that individual interest in the content that propels him to go on for further activity.
