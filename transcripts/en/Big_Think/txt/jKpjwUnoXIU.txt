Speaker 1:          00:13          Short is more difficult and I think we have to be recognized. Uh, we're in for a, a long, difficult, a top problem. Uh, things have not even reached the bottom. One of the problems that we face is not only if we lost confidence in our financial institutions, we've lost confidence in votes who are supposed to be managing our economy. Uh, I can tell you for a fact, you know, they were going around your friends things, a g eight, seven meetings and saying last May saying we've turned the corner, you know, things are turning up. Things are going well. I'm clearly, uh, they were either doing a sales job or they didn't understand, but in either case, why should anybody listen to these guys again, they've been so consistently wrong. So, uh, the, the, um, there is this crisis of confidence, um, the problems we're going to get worse.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Uh, we're only about halfway through the fall and the housing prices, housing prices go down more, more, more foreclosures will occur halfway through, assuming we don't overshoot that is to say when you have a bubble, when the bubble breaks, you don't typically go back to the normal level. You go further down and then you bounce back up. So things may be even worse than what I just suggested. If there is overshooting. Secondly, states and localities are facing serious problems. Revenues are plummeting here in New York City. New York state depends very heavily on revenues from the financial sector. It's plummeting, uh, but states and localities depends have, I wouldn't call it a balanced budget framework. When revenues go down, they have to cut back expenditures. And as they cut back expenditures, the economy goes further down. AIESEC several months ago that the first agenda in stimulus ought to be to make up for the shortfall in this state and local revenues.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Because if you don't, you're going to have a downward pressure on the economy, cut back of services to the poor, a cutback of investments that would be the basis of longterm economic growth. But the Bush administration decided to give a tax cut. They think the tax cut a is a solution to every problem. The tax cuts were part of the problem. The problem of America is not that we consume too little with the savings rate of zero. How could anybody say that? Yet that was the solution that the Bush administration put forward. So, um, uh, the future cutbacks in state and local expenditures are going to depress the economy, uh, as the banking sector faces problems, they're going to be more reluctant to lend. And as people see their houses price go down, they're going to be more reluctant to borrow. Uh, the lack of transparency means that even banks won't lend to each other.

Speaker 1:          03:30          So if there's a bank with money, it's not going to be willing to lend to a bank with the problem because it doesn't know what the risk that it faces are. So, uh, I think we're good. Mike say it only in the first half of this game, and, uh, I, I would expect that the problems to continue to unfold, I think we're in a very difficult position because the, uh, people that we turn to traditionally have been the financial markets and there are two reasons not to trust them at this point. First, they've shown an enormous in competence. Why should we trust these people who got us into the mess to get us out of it? Their judgments, their understanding of the economy is very, very limited. They understand how to make money in good times, how to protect themselves at the expense of their investors.

Speaker 1:          04:26          They understand that, but we're talking about a systemic and economic why phenomena and they've clearly demonstrated a lack of competence in that area. And secondly, they have a vested interest. Um, you know, they, they want to protect their own future and they're willing to let the economy go down. Um, you know, repeatedly a secretary treasurer try to get Wall Street to come together and say, look, it looks help Lehmann brothers. They said, no, we'd rather see the economy go down. Then to put our balance sheet at risk, so their interests are clearly divergent. Take Fatty Mac and Fannie Mae. When we did the first bailout didn't work. When did the first bail out? Right after that they found Fannie Mae a issue, a dividend payment, putting the taxpayer even more at risk. They were taking money out as the government was saying, we'll put money in. I mean, it's unconscionable. So there's a clear divergence of interest so we can't turn to them.

Speaker 1:          05:32          We can't turn to political leaders that are dependent on money from the lobbyists from Wall Street, which is particularly true with the Republican Party in, in this coming election. So I think on unfortunately, that I think we have to turn to academics, people who've studied the matter that have a, don't have a vested interest other than the best interest of making sure our economy functions well and our jobs are protected. Uh, you know, and, and our families, our houses don't go down, but it's that broader national interest that I think, uh, we really have to be protecting. And I don't think we can turn to one street to get the answer.
