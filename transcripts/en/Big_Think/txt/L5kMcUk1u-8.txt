Speaker 1:          00:07          No, I don't, I don't believe in a class. I, uh, you know, I hate to always sound like a middle of the road or I don't believe in a clash of civilization. I think the other thing that's a helpful way to look at it, and I think, um, I think Muslim people or a Muslim people around the world are probably like everybody else around the world. And people are more or less the same. They care about their children. They care about the opportunities they have. They care about freedom and self expression. And when they feel, uh, you know, whether or not their worldview is, is right, uh, on this, you know, when they feel dictated to are tyrannized, even if it's the tyranny of a culture, even if it's the tyranny of Mickey Mouse, you know, invading their homes, uh, they, you know, they're, they're, they're going to stand in opposition.

Speaker 1:          00:45          And I think there's a sizable number of Muslims, and by no means a majority who, uh, you know, who feel threatened by the, by, by America's place in the world and by the export of American culture and the militarization of their region. And, uh, and I don't think that makes it a civilization class. Cause then that implies that it's a battle to the death and you can never win people over. And I think we know that's not true. And I think history tells us that's not true. Uh, that, you know, people make decisions that are best for them and best for their children and their families and their economic wellbeing and their safety. Uh, and if they, and, and, and if, you know, and they'll change their minds and their worldviews according to that. Um, but do I think that it's all overblown? And that in fact, there is no, uh, you know, army of radical Islam that in fact, September 11th was just an isolated incident.

Speaker 1:          01:29          And as somebody has, one Democrat recently told me, you know, if you'd, if you'd gone to sleep on September 10th, 2001 and woke up, you know, last week, you'd think that we'd had 12 cities destroy. We've completely overreacted. I don't agree with that. I think, I think it's a serious defining threat for this moment. I think there are people trying to kill off. I think there are many people trying to kill us. I don't think this is the red scare. You know, the John Birch Society and Bob Dylan singing about looking under his toilet for communism. And I think this is, I think this is a, a and an and a relatively organized and very dangerous group of people who, who can and probably will get access to the worst kind of weaponry we know. And if we didn't, if we didn't take that seriously as a foreign policy priority, I think we would not be doing, you know, we would not be fulfilling our responsibility to the world.
