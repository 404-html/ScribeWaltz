Um, I, you know, I suppose I would be, I do more optimistic if I felt other people were, uh, less irrationally optimistic. I think people are not fully aware of some of the risks and some of the challenges we face and because of that are overly complacent. And I think that's, that seems to me is, uh, a recipe for, um, dramatically increasing the probability, something very bad, um, bad happening. Um, but, uh, but you know, these things are very, it's very hard to, it's very hard to know and you know, it, uh, it's very hard to know which choices are going to be the critical ones and how these things are precise and work out because the world's a big place. A lot of complicated things are, are going on. Um, I, I tend to, I guess my, if I had, if I had to makeup, if you held a gun to my head, forced me to make a prediction. I think we're headed towards, um, you know, 20, 30 years of incredible chaos and turmoil. And then at the tail end of, we will emerge with a world better than any weekend
