Speaker 1:          00:10          I committed myself in, in my book Keynes, the return of the master to the view that the blame lies chiefly with the economists. I because of my, uh, conviction that ideas matter and that other people, they're not just puppets of ideas, but what's what goes on in their heads. What they think about the world is really provided by, uh, the thinkers and in this case the economist. And that shapes their actions to an extraordinary degree. It's not enough to say, look, bankers were, were, were immensely greedy and that they committed lots of frauds. I mean that's not that they were set free. That sort of particular proclivity in human nature was set free to do its best and its worst. Well who set it free? Well obviously regulators and governments, but politicians and regulators or consumers of ideas, they never have any ideas of their own.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Um, if it take too much, too much, like hard work to develop ideas or you get them on, you get them off menus and you pick the ones that suit you and say they were the, so there was this chain and I think that was the important thing. If you like financial intermediation, financial services was set free to go beyond their rightful place. A place by which they had been restrained in the past. And I think in the periods when they were restrained, economies were much more stable and they, they, they became later on. So that's my basic answer. It's the ideas that are important.

Speaker 1:          01:52          By the time you're in a hole, I mean the crisis remember came on very, very suddenly. You could say it had been germinating for the previous year. Of course people were alert to things even in 2007 but you know, then hit with a thunder clap. And within a month it was as though the whole of the western banking system was about to be wiped out. And that's when they came in very, very fast. Governments and, and, and, and, and, and central banks. And then after that they have to say, okay, now we're in this whole, how do we sort of nudge, nudge economies out of it? Because economies with, by this time, our life support system, the banks are on life support system and the real economy was starting to be on a life support system. So Keynes I think would have, would have actually approved of most of that.

Speaker 1:          02:39          I think some things he would have done in different way. But do they go back to the old, old question? Yeah. It's, it's, it's almost no use asking what would he have done in detail because things have changed. But it's the spirit, uh, his, his, his analysis and the spirit in which he would have tackled these problems that are important. And I think he would have been on the side of expanding, uh, always. When you're sliding down a rather than a buttoning up your coats and, and, and, and saying, we must, we must, we must tighten, tighten our belts. Cause I think he would have thought that would have brought to us, bring us even lower than, than, than we, than we've gone
