Speaker 1:          00:00          We're going to see the elephant is a story about a young man who believes themselves to be the greatest writer in the history of the world. The only problem is he hasn't written anything yet. It's a. it's a condition. Many young writers find themselves in. He moves to San Francisco because he thinks of this as a romantic literary city and a place for him to fulfill his destiny. And he gets a job, sort of sweet. Talks himself into a job at a place called the morning trumpet, which is a third rate newspaper, whose, you know, heyday was probably an 1850 right after the gold rush. And it's been going downhill ever since. Even still, they think slater brown, the name of this young man is something wrong about it. He just doesn't quite add up. And so to get rid of him, they say, if you're such a hot writer, go find us a story.

Speaker 1:          00:51          And they're pretty sure they'll never see him again. Uh, he proceeds to go out into the city of San Francisco to look for a story. Uh, and a series of things happened to them. And in very short order, he's the most powerful person in the city. And um, that's, that's the nuts and bolts of it. But, uh, when I sat down, people asked me how I came to this idea and I was walking around San Francisco one day about seven years ago and I saw this guy, I saw my character in a coffee shop and that was the impetus for me to start to tell this story. And the same character is in Dallas today. He's in New Orleans, he's in New York City's in London. It's the romantic, idealized young man or woman who is a, been a passionate reader and had, wants to be a writer and now is on the process of figuring out how to get there. And that's really what the book's theme is about on some level.

Speaker 1:          01:50          I don't think I'm probably a good judge of my themes yet. I think there's still emerging and I don't think when I sit down to write, I'm usually drawn in by something that I've heard a, whether it's a piece of dialogue or maybe I've seen something. And that's sort of the starting point, when I started to write this book, going to see the elephant, I didn't know where the end was, which was a huge mistake. Uh, and I also didn't know if I could do it. I mean, it's sort of like training for a marathon. You believe you can do it, uh, you want to do it, but can you do it? And this book, uh, was a process of me figuring out how to do that and writing it was a huge leap of faith for me. But also, you know, as I said earlier, perhaps a benign mental illness, I feel like I'm themes are things that are found after the fact and that most writers don't consciously engage in that or if they do, I think sometimes their work suffers because of that. Uh, I, I find my entry point into these things to be more around characters or a particular feeling or mood and not a, you know, I want to write a story about coming of age or something like that.
