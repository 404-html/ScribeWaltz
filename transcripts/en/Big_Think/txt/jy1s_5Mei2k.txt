Speaker 1:          00:13          There's definitely been a lot of talk of, of the young Brooklyn writer, and then there's now been the backlash for sure. Um, you know, I got called the Brooklyn Writer, uh, not too long ago, and I was torn between a sense of pride or a sense of embarrassment because now it's become such a thing. Um, I think we again, have to think of why that phenomenon exists, right? Brooklyn was initially a cheap neighborhood for writers to live and you could have space and you could probably, most importantly, you'd have your own office, which, which is what I have now in my current place in Brooklyn. I have a nice office. I wouldn't have been able to get that in Manhattan at the modest price and I'm paying. So there's those considerations. Um, but then, you know, you get enough artists and writers moving to neighborhood, uh, the, the thing begins to brand itself, um, probably originating in a sense of pride, right?

Speaker 1:          01:13          People saying, well, yeah, you know, we're Brooklyn Writers and this is a thing and, you know, trying to defend themselves and then it becomes a sort of embarrassing brand. Um, so yeah, there's, there's times you, you have to sort of say it with a smile, you know, that you're a Brooklyn writer, but, um, but that's probably going to change because Brooklyn is getting awfully expensive to the point where it's definitely in competition with Manhattan, uh, especially the savory parts. And, uh, so I don't know. I wonder in a few years, are we going to have the, the queen's writer, you know, and then far into the future when the Staten Island writer, you know, if it's scary. Um, but what I don't like about it is that it takes so much attention from all the writers that don't even live in New York. That's one thing about the book tour that was so interesting to me and about the friendships that I've forged with the writers who live all over this country.

Speaker 1:          02:13          And, and, you know, I think I always thought that as a writer, you need it to live here, you know? And, and even recently, I thought it's a good idea to be near my editor, my agent, or to, you know, and it's, it's sort of a fallacy. Um, so I, I don't like the feeling that I don't like spreading the, the sort of idea that, that writers need to live, if not in the Manhattan, then right by it. Um, because the beauty is now you can, for the most part, live everywhere anywhere you want. Um, but, um, I do love Brooklyn and I like, and I like my, my new neighborhood and Kensington, there's a lot of, it was a very vibrant Middle Eastern community there that I can spy on, which is fun. Um, and you get a great diversity in Brooklyn, um, and it is affordable and it's beautiful. So it's a formula.
