Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, the most important issue is the one we just talked about because we're so mishandling and at this point in time and that is what is America's proper role in the world. The second big issue I think is that this society is not improving. One of the things that we've lost somehow in the United States, which the puritans brought to us in the beginning, was the notion that individual human beings and societies where the largest mall should always be trying to improve themselves. They should be trying to learn more. They should be trying to improve their character, their service. There are all kinds of. We've kind of lost that notion so that self improvement has become a joke or it means something like losing some weight and we have as an we focused instead on happiness and pleasure and enjoying life and I think that's a very serious problem for it. We ought to talk about that and now there are issues. There was the healthcare financing problem that we have in the United States. There is, there's going to be an economic problem that we have is coming up. There are those kinds of issues, but the really big ones are the ones that are, what are we about? What are we about in the world and what are we about at home?
