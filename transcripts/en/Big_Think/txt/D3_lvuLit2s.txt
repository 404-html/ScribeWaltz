Speaker 1:          00:07          I was born in Russia and came over when I was very little. I was six and a, I grew up outside of Boston. My parents, first they lived in Brighton, which is where the Russians start out. And then they gradually moved west. They moved to Brookline and then they moved to Newton and that's where they stopped. And now some people, they move out to Lincoln and conquered, um, where they're not very many Russians at all. But in, uh, in Newton, there are a few Russians. So I'm partly from Moscow and I'm partly from Newton. Um, and those, those things have shaped me and complex and confusing ways. If my parents were from a particular millia in, in Russia, a particular intellectual, social millia, my mom was a literary critic and, um, then they came to Newton, um, where they sort of managed to reconstruct that, uh, with the other Russians that were there.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Um, but it was cut off. It was a world that they were cut off from the American world that surrounded them. So it was sort of island of a Russian, a computer programmers and intellectuals, um, in a prosperous American suburb. Um, and for me that was, um, it was confusing because I very much wanted to be an American. I wanted to, uh, fit in with the rest of the kids. And, um, I wanted to engage with American life. I wasn't, I didn't want to sit at home with my parents and the Russian books and drinking tea all the time. Um, but at the same time, I, I knew I could, I sensed, even though I didn't acknowledge until a bit later, that, uh, my parents were, it was a very rich world. Um, and I didn't really understand it very well until I started going back to Russia when I was in my early twenties, and, and seeing the world that they'd come from and, and understanding what their place in that world had been.

Speaker 1:          02:28          Um, and that's been something that I have been sort of working and thinking about, uh, for a while. And, and, and this book is really the first time that I've actually, uh, really started getting added. Uh, the book is, it's not about, it's not about Russian immigrants by any means. Uh, but that's kind of in the background. Um, the problem of, of being a person who, who has a lot of ideas, um, uh, comes a culture that's filled with ideas, um, and is confronted with an American reality that is not particularly interested in ideas at all. So my parents growing up, there was just no context for them. Um, they were these strange people, uh, living on woodcliff road, um, in, in our little house. Um, and then when I was going to Moscow in the 90s, I found a whole world of people just like my parents.

Speaker 1:          03:29          Um, and so, uh, it just put them into a context that I could understand for me with regard to this stuff, a very important experience was toward my, uh, toward the end of my senior year when I was working on my thesis. I was, um, I was a major, my major was Russia and America, but I ended up writing on a ts Elliot, who is neither really even, not even very American. Uh, he had spent a lot of time in England, um, but one of the, uh, one of the groups of people that, that Elliot meant the most to in the states where these people are on the partisan review. And, um, I didn't, I hadn't really known about these people at all. Um, they're not, uh, they weren't really part of the college curriculum. Um, and they were, uh, and I discovered these people who basically were first generation immigrants from Russia.

Speaker 1:          04:29          Um, so a Philip Rov, the editor of the partisan review was actually Ivan Greenberg. Um, he, he was born in Russia, came over when he was little, um, saul bellow as born in Petersburg. Um, and, and his parents left when he was still a baby. Um, and so these people who are all been born around 1920, um, so they were the age of my grandparents had actually had very similar experiences to me, um, in a way where they had, uh, their parents were, were, were foreigners. They didn't speak English very well. Um, and yet they very much wanted to be part of a American intellectual life. So discovering those people and feeling like I, in fact, I had a very similar experience to those people and that they were, um, a much more experience that was much more like mine than, than that of my contemporaries that of my American Jewish contemporaries.

Speaker 1:          05:27          Uh, that was a very, uh, important experience for me. And that has allowed me to, um, I think develop a way of, of writing about Russia and thinking about Russia, thinking about this place that I had come from. And that had been very important to me and certainly to my reading development, um, or writing about it in America because that's what these people had done. And they were all still very interested in Russia and the Soviet Union. Um, and they were, they were using these things to understand American life. So, you know, so irving Howe and, and, uh, Saul bellow or people who, who have helped me a great deal.
