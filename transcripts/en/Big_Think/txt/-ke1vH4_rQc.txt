Speaker 1:          00:05          If you look at our current technological systems near our minds are they are very different. And one of the biggest questions for me is what's the difference between where we are now and where we need to be. If you want to build mines, if you want to build systems that are generally intelligent and self motivated and maybe self aware. And of course the answer to this we don't know because if you knew we already done it, but uh, there are basically several perspectives on this. One is our minds as general learning systems that are able to waddle arbitrary things including themselves. And if they are this, they probably need a very distinct set of motivations, needs, um, things that they want to do. And I think that humans get their specifics due to their particular needs. We have cognitive and social and physiological needs and they turn us on who we are.

Speaker 1:          00:54          Our motivations determine what, where we put our attention to and what you learned and what we actually do in the world. But you model. How about we perceive what are your conscious of in a similar sense it might be that it's sufficient to build a genuine learning architecture and combined this is a good motivational system in beer, not there yet that we have built a genuine learning architecture. For instance, our minds can learn and create new algorithms. They can be used to write code and invent code programming code for instance, or the rules that you need to build the shop and ran their chop. If you were a shopkeeper, which is some kind of programming task in its own right. We don't know how to build a system that is able to do this yet. It involves, for instance, that we have systems that are able to learn loops and you have some techniques to do this.

Speaker 1:          01:38          For instance, a long short term memory and a few other tricks, but they are nowhere near of what people can do so far and it's not quite clear how much work needs to be done to extend these systems into what people can do. It could be that it's very simple. It could be that it's going to take a lot of research, the dire view, and this was more the traditional view is that human minds have a lot of also going our complexity that you need to build a lot of functionality into it, like in Minsky Society of mind to get to all the tricks that people are up to. And if that is the case then it might take a very long time. I had to do, we have, we created all these different financial mechanisms, but I don't think that it's going to be so dire because our genome is very short and most of that codes for the single cell, very little of it codes for the brain. And I think a sale is much more complicated than a brain. A brain is probably largely self organizing and build, not like clockwork, but like a couple of Chino. So you'll mix the right ingredients and then you let it percolate and then forms a particular kind of structure. So I do think because nature of pulls it off pretty well in most of the cases that, um, even though brain probably needs more complexity than a Cappuccino, dramatically more, it's going to be much simpler than building a very complicated machine like a cell.
