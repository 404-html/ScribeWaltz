Speaker 1:          00:03          To war again, when I was listening to a talk earlier today, which,

Speaker 2:          00:11          uh, talked about lifting a Edr men out of Oregon, MDA and placing them somewhere else, and, and, uh, and uh, without destroying the whole country, I mean a way of ways of neutralizing dictators that, uh, are, uh, less or that are more humane and less destructive than just an all out war on the country. Uh, I think I'm a leader that would have a more inventive sense of strategies because we need some new paradigm. I mean, war is sort of an, it should be. We should be over that, that, that old paradigm of just throwing our youngest people into this.

Speaker 1:          00:56          The face of danger.
