Speaker 1:          00:06          Is Peter White and I teach in the mathematics department at Columbia University, or my title is senior lecturer. Well, the first thing I'd say is that when people set talk about string theory, they're actually talking about a very complex set of ideas that um, lots of people, you know, very large amount people have worked on and done a lot of different things with the, um, the probably what it's best known for and what got people all excited about it and the physics community is, there's kind of like the conjecture that instead of at the most fundamental level you can understand matter in the universe in, in terms not of point particles. Uh, which is the way our best theories currently you kind of understand things. But in terms of kind of vibrating, if you like vibrating kind of loops of some elementary objects, so you're at your elementary object instead of being a point like thing is something you should think of more as being a one dimensional loop or a kind of string string, which is kind of moving around.

Speaker 1:          01:01          So it has a lot more, um, it can do a lot more complicated things than a point. This is kind of loop of elementary matter, whatever it is. And so it, it gives you a very different kind of class of, of theories and then the ones that, um, we've been so successful with before and the, the, the cafe. So during the 60s that this idea was initially developed and initially people tried to do one thing with these class of theories, something which didn't work out that well. And then starting in the late seventies and eighties, people then, um, came up with the conjecture that maybe you really could unify all of physics and solve some of the open problems in physics by replacing our standard theories. Maybe we call the standard model with some kind of string theory. And that's so, so since this idea, it became very popular in 1984 and so it's been now 25 years.

Speaker 1:          01:55          People have been working very hard on that. And, uh, and, and I think just the initial thing, I've got people very excited, at least I would claim, you know, really hasn't worked out and really can't work out. And that's kind of been, I think a lot of the reason controversy has been an argument over this issue of, you know, whether this, um, for a speculative idea about whether you can use the strings to develop, to get a unified theory about whether that really has, is that, is that an idea that's failed or is there still some hope for it? I think that's really the, uh, what's the, the controversial part of it?

Speaker 1:          02:30          Well, the main thing to understand about the current state of physics is that we have in some sense kind of a victim of our own success. We have an incredibly successful theory called the standard model. And it, um, it, it really explains everything that we can observe about, um, in terms of a fairly small number of elementary particles and some basic forces between them. And it's a, it's a quite beautiful theory ended. Um, it really just kind of absurdly successful every experiment, anybody knows how to do that in principle can be, um, did that, this theory has something to say about it. It works. It works out perfectly, you know, to, to whatever experimental, um, in whenever you need, how you can do an experiment to whatever precision. And it comes out exactly as predicted by this model. So we have kind of a semi unified theory.

Speaker 1:          03:19          This, we have this quite nice, beautiful structure, which explains everything we can see. But it still, it still leaves open. So several questions and um, some of the questions are just to kind of why, you know, we have all these different particles, they all have different masses. Why do they all have different masses? We don't understand why the electron has a certain mass quirks of other masses. So, so they're just kind of things which the theory just doesn't address. It just doesn't answer these questions. And they're questions that, which has physicists we think there should be answers to. But then there's also one kind of remaining forest, which isn't part of the standard model, which is the four, which is the gravitational force. And the, um, the gravitational force is much, much weaker than these other forces. And it's, it, it has a somewhat different nature.

Speaker 1:          04:06          So it, the problem with it is that we don't, um, w w the, the, the, these other forces that we have something which is a quantum theory. It really, it's, it's quantum mechanics. It really works down to the microscopic level. And in terms of this very fundamental idea about, about reality called quantum mechanics, the theory of gravity that we still use is Einstein's theory of general relativity. And it's what we call a classical theory. It's not a quantum mechanical theory. And the, um, you can make an estimate. The problem is that you can make an estimate within this theory of how big quantum mechanical effects would be. And that estimate tells you that they're just so absurdly small. You can never hope to see them. So there's kind of a problem with principal. We had this theory, which is not a proper quantum mechanical theory.

Speaker 1:          04:50          And we know that there's things which it can't quite properly explained, but there, there's, they're far too small for us to study them and to, to, to, to try to see them. So we would anyways. So it's, we're not completely happy with this setup. We have a, a force which doesn't quite fit with the others and uh, which for logical reasons that we would like to unify it with these others and think and understand it as a quantum mechanical theory and, uh, we've never quite been successful and able to do that. And, and this is what strict string theory was. It was kind of a promise of a way of how to do that. And uh, anyway, that's kind of that, that's why people got so excited.

Speaker 1:          05:29          Yeah. It's Kinda, it's kind of a famous phrase among physicists. It goes back to a, and there's a well known theorist called Wolfgang Pauli and the in the 50s stories that towards the end of his life, someone, I guess he goes, he was well known for being a very kind of hyper critical of, of, of, of, of things that were going on. And we'll get up the middle of a seminar and started saying, you know, it's wrong. It's completely wrong. And late in his life, someone asked him about some work that was some of some, some speculative idea of someone and heavily he shook his head and said, well, that one's not even wrong. And, and so the, uh, it, it's, it's, it's a well known phrase among physicists and it kind of carries I think two, two meanings. I mean, w w one one of them is just kind of a more somewhat of a term of abuse.

Speaker 1:          06:15          Well, that's so bad. It's not even wrong, but, but there's a more interesting, and there's also more kind of technical meaning that a very often used, you have respect, you have expected of idea. And if it's, if it's not a very good idea or it turns out you actually can't even, you end up not being able to do very much with it, you end up not being able to, um, to predict anything with it or to, to, or it's just not useful. So there's also a notion of not being not even wrong in the sense that it's not an idea which can be fully developed or it can turn into something which is powerful enough to actually predict something and be wrong. So this one problem is string theory is that it's kind of a I theory, which they could explain what the problems are, but the problems are such that you can ever even pin it down and say this is exactly what it predicts and let's go out and test it. So it's not even capable of being wrong, being wrong or being falsified are being shown to be wrong. So that's the more relevant meaning here. Really.

Speaker 1:          07:18          I said, I mean it's string theory is actually a very complicated stories. So they're, they're, they're, you know, if you start out with this hypothesis that maybe you're are, our fundamental objects are not points, but are these strings, there's a lot of different things you can try and do that you can, you, you, you have a whole different class of theories you can play with. And so I think a lot of, if you look at what most people who are still doing string theory doing, they're actually not directly trying to, um, to develop as unified theory anymore. They're off kind of doing other things with string theory there that people these days are trying to apply it to um, to problems and nuclear physics. They're applying it to problems and, um, in solid state physics, understanding superconductors. So they're, the people who still are interested in it, you know, are, are, are often kind of, even if they will, they may or may not explicitly admit that they've kind of given up on the unified theory idea, but they're, they're often doing other things.

Speaker 1:          08:14          So there's a, there's a very active, um, pursuit of string theory in, you know, with other applications that don't have any to do with unification. It's also turned out to be very interesting. And in mathematics, there's a very, one of the things that I'm most interested in is the intersection between mathematics and physics and um, the way the two fields kind of affect each other and ideas from physics lead to very interesting things in mathematics, ideas and mathematics get used and they give us new physics. And string theory has been very, very fruitful in terms of raising questions, which I'm happy to have led to very interesting mathematics. So there's a very active field of research given between math and physics in string theory, but, but it, but it just doesn't seem to be relevant to this question of unification. Yeah, I certainly shouldn't. My critical criticism of string theory is not that, well, you know, if you guys would just realize that you should be doing such and such, that would, that would solve a lot of problems.

Speaker 1:          09:09          I don't actually, yeah, I don't think that I have some my own ideas, which I'm very excited by, which at which I'm pursuing, which are also new ideas about how to use mathematics to do things in physics, which don't have anything to do with string theory. And, and, and, which kind of at least lead me to see you there. You know, there's a lot of areas, a lot of things we don't understand which are closer to are the standard model which we, which we do know works. There's a lot of kind of mathematical mathematical structure behind the, um, the standard model, which is still kind of mysterious and which is not well understood. And I think pursuing that is more likely to get us somewhere then the districts or unification idea, just because you're starting from something which, you know, a theory which you know is right.

Speaker 1:          09:50          And trying to further develop your understanding of that theory is maybe a more fruitful thing to do. Then I'm trying to, you know, just kinda throw out, throw the, throw all that out and start a fresh with something more speculative. The, um, I guess it gets one thing to talk about is, is the, uh, this, uh, what's happening in Geneva even that, this, this month, that, and so the, uh, a lot of the, a lot of the problem with the field, as I've said, is this business of being a victim of our own success, not having any experimental results of disagree with the theory, which makes it very, very hard to figure out how to, how do you improve a theory if you've got no kind of clues as to what, you know, what, what, what, what might possibly be wrong that it needs to be, needs to be changed.

Speaker 1:          10:34          And so there's a, this accelerator called the LHC okay. At cern in Geneva. And it's been in development for quite a few years now. And it's been a long process getting it working. But just over the past month, they've finally got it to inject beams into this accelerator and start colliding these beams and start doing some new physics. And over the next year, they'll start raising the energy of this accelerator to the point where we'll, um, we'll, we'll be in in a new energy regime where, which allows us to, uh, to, to get experimental data about what's happening at higher energy, which also coat, which corresponds to what's happening at shorter and shorter distances to um, to see what's happening in shortage. Shorter distances. In some sense you need to use shorter and shorter wavelength or higher and higher energy probes. And this, uh, this new accelerator, you know, pr finally promises some data in this new energy range beyond what we've been able to see so far.

Speaker 1:          11:28          And there, there are reasons to believe that this new energy range is one where, um, that we can actually start to get answers to some of these questions about, especially about mass, about why, why did different particles have different masses? Um, so, so, so, so the state of the standard model is that it's as quite beautiful theory, but you, um, to make the whole thing work, you need a, you need, you need to make sure that a certain kind of physical phenomenon. It has to happen basically in one way of saying it is that the theory has certain symmetry is, um, and, and the, the lowest tenant, the lowest energy theory, the lowest energy state, the vacuum of the theory has to have nontrivial properties under one of the cemeteries. It can't normally you say vacuum state. It's just kind of completely and interesting. And if you rotate it around, move it around the vacuum, nature can't, nothing can happen.

Speaker 1:          12:22          It's just a vacuum state. But, um, but the vacuum actually has to have interesting properties under these kinds of mathematical symmetry transformations and the so, so, so we know that that has to be true in order to make the theory work. And there, there are many ways you can imagine, um, making that happen. And, and one way is called the higgs, the higgs mechanism. And so the higgs mechanism involves a postulating the existence of some, some new fields and new kind of matter, which is this, this higgs part, this, this higgs field. And, um, and, and then giving this, that he did the dynamics for the making the properties of the higgs field such that the, that, that the, in the vacuum state, the higgs field, we'll have this done trivial property. So you can do that in some sentence. The higgs field is kind of the simplest way of getting what you want, but when you do it, you also, um, you, you, you, you, you end up losing the ability to predict all sorts of things.

Speaker 1:          13:25          Cause then if some, then there's the question of why, why did, why does the party, we'll have a certain mass just becomes, well, because that's how strong, it's how strongly it interacts with the higgs field. So you, it's a simplest way of making something happen. You know, it has to happen, but it, it, it, it, it's a way which has a lot of things. You don't really like it, it's not a very satisfactory way of doing it because it kind of of necessity. Then it leaves open a whole range of questions and questions, what you would hope to have answers to, but you just from, you just can't answer it that way. So one thing which we hope to learn from the LHC is, is this higgs mechanism or does this higgs field really there? Um, in, in which case that, that'll, that'll be actually somewhat of a disappointment because it'll mean that, okay, this theory kind of continues to work and we don't, we, we still don't know how to answer some of these questions or I think that the much more exciting possibility is going to be that there's some, some, something else causing this phenomenon of the, of the vacuum behaving this way.

Speaker 1:          14:28          And, uh, and, and there's something else would be a, you know, give us, um, what would be, it would be something which would be more interesting and we'll, and we'll allow answers to these questions. So instead, so this whole, this, this name of the Higgs field and finding the higgs particle, that's kind of a, it's an over simplified way of saying what, what, what we're really hoping, which is we're really hoping to understand what is causing the vacuum to behave this way. And, uh, and, and we have good reason there. There's, there's kind of a number in the theory which kind of says how big this phenomenon going on in the vacuum is. And, um, and what the size of it is. And the size is exactly the size that this, uh, this accelerator should finally be able to probe. So there's, there, there it's not, um, there's a very good reason to believe that this is the right machine to kind of start answering some of these questions.

Speaker 1:          15:19          The real problem is that the, the ways that we knew that there are various ways, a lot of people have studied a lot of other alternatives to the Higgs field, which I'm, the problem is that they're all fairly complicated and none of them, they all have as bad or even worst problem is in that the higgs field, they've all, so none of them are convincing. We don't have the convincing alternative to it. And, and I don't either. I guess, I mean the one about all I can say about that is that the, there I, I'm very interested in, in, in some of the kind of mathematical parts of the theory that we don't understand and some of the kind of deep mathematical structure that we don't understand in our, in these theories. And part of what we don't understand it and in these theories actually is, you know, is related to this problem of, of the vacuum of this behavior, of the vacuum.

Speaker 1:          16:05          So, I mean in my ideal world it would turn out that there's, there's, there's something there, there's something still to be learned about the mathematical structure of these theories, which would in the end, you know, explain this, this higgs, this higgs phenomenon, this is problem with the vacuum. But, but I mean I, I wish I knew how to do that, but I certainly don't have a UN has a very big reasons to believe are there. That's an interesting thing to look at. But, but I, I certainly don't have an answer to it. And I think I get, if I had to assign probabilities, who had what, I would a guess is that the, I'd say there's about a 50% chance the lhc will actually see an actual higgs particle and there will be a, there is some kind of higgs field and that this is going to be kind of depressing for us because it means, well, whenever there is this field there, it's, it's, it's working like this and the answer these questions, we would like answers to our, you'd have to go even higher energies or a smaller distances to understand them. And, or there's, there's, I think there's a 50% probability we'll find that we won't see a higgs particle, or at least not a higgs particle, the kind, um, that, that you see in the simplest model and, and that, and that will actually give us clues as to what's really going on. And that will be much more exciting. So, but I don't know which is going to happen.

Speaker 1:          17:27          You never know. I mean there's no reason that you, um, the general problem that with particle physics is that the, these questions we're asking are at, you know, they're having such high energy scales are such short distances that it's um, it's very hard to see how to do anything very practical with this. I mean, anything like these partners we're talking about, you know, I have often have have lifetimes which are, you know, 10 to the minus 20 seconds or, I mean they're, they're, they're, they're just, if you produce a higgs particle, it's going to be so short lived it, it's incredibly difficult to even see any evidence of the thing. It's not something you'd be able to go out and use these higgs particles to carry around and do something with it. On the other hand, I mean, you, you don't really know what you're going to find it.

Speaker 1:          18:08          If you do find, especially if you find something, I guess I, I could say it this way, if you do just find this higgs particle and just this higgs field, it's very hard to debate to do anything really practical with that. If you, if you find something completely new understanding of this theory, then who, who knows? I mean you can conject clay come up with all sorts of models. You can come up with models in which there's kind of new heavy, long lived particles which you could then imagine doing things with. But um, I think it is probably a pretty good bet that within the near future, this is not really a big way of practical. This is really a matter of I'm just trying to understand the world better and not, not, not as many as, not in a way, but not in a way that's particularly going to be useful for her for doing anything too practical. It's going to affect people anytime soon.

Speaker 1:          18:57          I mean some of that is because people, one of the alternatives to this is this higgs mechanism is it, and people started studying. It sets out some models in which, well, to go back a little bit, I mean one thing about string theory and string theory, to make string theory work, you have to have extra dimensions. You have to have more than a three space and one time dimensions and that, then that's kind of an in some sense, the main problem with it with string theory that you have to it, you have to have at least five extra dimensions. I start, sorry, six extra dimensions. And, um, the, the, the predictions of the theory and being able to use it for anything depending on what's happening, at least six extra dimensions. And that's no one has ever, initially, the hope was that there was a fairly small number of consistent ways of dealing with these extra dimensions and that would, uh, you know, make this a predictive theory, but it has turned out they're just too much.

Speaker 1:          19:54          You can do and you can kind of get anything you want by having these extra dimensions to different things. And so one, one thing as part of this, one thing that people studied was models in which these extra dimensions are actually of the executive, the right size that the Lhd, you should start seeing evidence of these extra dimensions and then producing black holes because it, because of these extra dimensions and that say, um, there's just never really been a reason to believe that these extra dimensions would, we'd see no evidence of them at our best accelerators now. And we'd go up by a factor of seven and energy and all of a sudden all these extra benches would appear. There's just, there's, there's absolutely no reason for that to be, to happen. It's you, you can make specked it a model in which it happens, but first of all, then anyways, so there's, there's really kind of no Ma no good motivation for these models and for them to happen and no evidence for them.

Speaker 1:          20:47          And then even if they were to exist when they did happen, any such black holes would kind of immediately, um, it'd be kind of completely unstable and what, it would just immediately decay into something else. So you wouldn't, you're not going to produce a, a dangerous black hole that way, but, but, but, but the first kind of, I think what caused all this trouble is that people kind of wanted to, to, um, to promote these extra dimensional models even though there was no good motivation for them. And so they promoted them by saying, well, in principle, you know, since we don't know what happens at higher energies, the Lhc, maybe evidence, these extra mentions will show up, but there's no good reason for that. So, but once people started promoting the idea of these extra dimensions of my job, then people are like, wow, if they show up, then maybe there'll be black holes. And it was kind of a speculation on top of speculation on how to speculation. But it's all, it's all suffered. There's has been, has no reason to believe that any such thing could, could, could possibly be true.

Speaker 1:          21:47          The thing that most fascinates me about this whole subject is, is something that, that, that promise, it quickly gets very technical. But, but there, there's a, there's some, there's, there's an area of mathematics which is known as representation theory. And from when, when I thinking and it's thinking about it is in terms of what are, what physicists were often called symmetries. So, so for instance, one of the basic facts about the laws of nature is that they're, um, they're, they're symmetric. Laws of nature are the same at, you know, if you move, if you move in any direction, are you moving time back and forth? The Laws of physics don't change. If you rotate things around in three dimensions, the laws of physics don't change. And so, so the, the so called symmetries and um, and these, these, these cemeteries have very important, um, physical implications.

Speaker 1:          22:34          So friends, the fact that the laws of physics don't change as if you change your, if you move in time, has physical implication that, that there's this thing called energy and energy is conserved. And same thing that and the fact that laws of physics don't change. If you move back and forth in different directions in space implies that there's a, um, something called momentum and momentum is conserved and doesn't change and as you move, as you evolve in time. And so, so these very, very fundamental facts about physics are kind of deeply grounded in the symmetries of, of nature. And so to a mathematician, this, this, this question is, um, is a question about what we call about groups and representations of these groups. So if you go into any math department and look at what they're doing, you'll see that you know that a lot, a lot of people and different kinds of mathematics are studying different structures, which are all so called groups.

Speaker 1:          23:29          And they're often when studying what are called representations of these groups. So even people setting num number theory kind of abstract things about, about prime numbers or something, they're also studying groups and certain representations, these groups. So there's kind of a, to the extent that mathematics has a kind of a unifying theme and a unifying principle which shows up in different areas of mathematics. It's about this row, this, these representations and representation theory. And the thing that most strike when the most of the things that most strikes me out physics and was fascinating to me about it is that if you look at quantum mechanics, quantum mechanics initially it looks like a very odd structure. It doesn't, it's not something that we can, we have any kind of intuitive understanding of it doesn't look like, um, you know, like what the way we're used to thinking about physics based on everyday experience.

Speaker 1:          24:18          But if you look at the mathematical structure and the basic structures of quantum mechanics, they're exactly the structures that show up in this theory, in this theory of representations. So there's a kind of a deep relation between math and physics, which is surrounding this whole notion of symmetries and representations of symmetries. So, so that's, so that's one thing that's always fascinated me and, and my own research, my own interest is, is in kind of developing t taking a lot that's been learned in mathematics. There's a lot that's been learned in mathematics over the years about how to think about representations and how to construct them and how to work with them. Some of it has made its way into physics had been using in physics and, and was using a physics since the early days of quantum mechanics. And, um, so for instance, one of the great kind of to the extent there is a, uh, a kind of hero of this book I wrote about this.

Speaker 1:          25:09          It's a mathematician and called the Herrmann vial who was a special, who kind of was one of the first people to understand how quantum mechanics work and to understand the relation to representations. But, but, but I, I, anyway, I think there, there's still a lot to be learned and that way and raised specifically the so called standard model has this group of symmetries which is called the gauge symmetry and it's an influential group and the standard kind of physics conjecture or understanding of the representations that this group is that there is that that should not be an interesting question. There should only be a trivial representation of this group. But anyway, my conjecture is that there's, there's actually a much more interesting question there. And, uh, and pursuing that you can, pursuing this question of how do you deal with the, with the gauge symmetry of this theory and in terms of using ideas from representation theory that are, um, that are more well known in mathematics that haven't been used in physics before, that you can actually get somewhere. So that's maybe a bit too technical, but that's about as good as I can do with this.

Speaker 1:          26:15          So it's hard to say and there's, um, we'll get improved. I don't know. There's a lot of the problem with, with elegant is actually an interesting a question. Maybe just say what, what is, what does elegance and what does it, what is beauty? I guess so one, the one thing, one thing that's come up even within this, this, the string theory, um, issue is this question are, you know, is this a beautiful idea or a beautiful theory? So, so my colleague Brian Greene as, um, irritant, very, very good book about this called the elegant universe. And so he's, um, and so, and, and, and within, within, within physics, this is our, I mean we're, we're, we're often raise struck by some of these basic ideas are, um, what we would like to our race striking and that we like to, in a way which we like to describe as being elegant are beautiful.

Speaker 1:          27:06          But, um, the problem with w with those, that terminology, especially with the terminology of beauty is that beauty means a lot of different things to a lot of different people and a lot of different ways in which things can be beautiful. But this really has very specific meaning and, and which is more along the lines of elegance, which is that we say that an idea as beautiful or elegant in mathematics or physics, if, you know, a very simple principle and raised simple idea or a simple set of ideas, it turns out to be very powerful and, and you know, leads to all sorts of unexpected structure and unexpected predictions. And, um, I think maybe the, what I find is, is, is, is the most beautiful, most elegant thing about this whole subject is a little bit what I was trying to explain earlier. If for instance, this idea, maybe just to say this idea that the, um, the fact that the laws of physics are the same as you as you move in time means that has very unexpected and significance.

Speaker 1:          28:03          It means that there, there is this thing called energy and um, you can associate a number of cold energy to us to institute a physical systems and it's not going to change it as, as you, as time evolves. So the, um, I mean that, that's actually the, so, so in, in, in, in classical physics, that's actually, they're there, that's a theorem called an annoyed. There's, they're, um, after, uh, method one called [inaudible] there. Uh, so, so, so there, it's a little bit of a slight non trivial theater, Amanda, and that, that's certainly a, a beautiful theorem. What, what fascinates me more is that in quantum mechanics, northern scenario isn't even a theorem. It's just kind of, it's just implicit in the definition. Just the, um, the way you set things up, it just is automatically true. So it's a, anyway, they're there, there's a theorem and, and approve in classical physics and then you, you, you, you, you, you start thinking about quantum mechanics and you think about it and then it's just kind of automatically true. There's not even a theorem anymore. And it's like, that's just beautiful.

Speaker 1:          29:10          Well, I think, I mean, any kind of thing that human beings do and there's certain politics to it and certain economic politics and Polish with field. So, but, um, mathematics is actually a relatively healthy field these days. I mean, people are, you know, are, are, are, are, are making, making good progress and a lot of different work, different ways. And it's also so, so anyway, I, I've, I've kind of lived part of my professional life and mathematics and part of the physics. And, um, and one thing to say about that, that mathematics is, it's a, I think a kid can have its problems, but, but, but, but it's, it's actually hasn't seen it. It hasn't seen a lot of the problems of other sciences and politically, partly, partly also the wonderful thing about mathematics is since so much of it is what people are doing is completely useless.

Speaker 1:          30:02          Nobody, I'm nobody kind of in the outside world we're like cares very much. You don't really have, you don't have kind of a right and left and people getting in, you know, kind of ideology coming in because there isn't any, it just doesn't actually connect up to the kinds of things that people who were worried about ideologically worry about. So most of mathematics, which it doesn't, it doesn't tell you anything one way or another about global warming or about, you know, health care or about any other number of things you might care about. So, so it's a mathematics. It is immune to a lot of exterior pot, real world politics because of that and the academic politics or it's there. But, um, I, I think it's actually less than a lot of fields. I, one of my colleagues likes to say that mathematics is the, he thinks that about the only subject that he knows of it in academia or in the real world where if two people disagree about something, if it, if people are studying some mathematical object, then there's what you're supposed to be a proof and they disagree about whether this proof works or not.

Speaker 1:          31:01          They will, you know, go into a room, sit down and talk about it and fairly quickly or at the end of the day one of them will admit they're wrong. And then he says, you know, that the problem a lot of companies, this is, this is just doesn't happen. Whereas mathematics, this is just happens all the time. And so the people, um, there is this notion of logic and proof and rigor, which we can all allows us to kind of all stay on one track. Physics is, um, well the other thing I'd say that physics, first of all, physics is a very complicated subject with many, many different things. A string theory and particle physics or only a small part of a physics. So when I talk about physics and I talked about them and the problems of those subjects, it's really a problem is of a very small, you know in one discipline, in one subfield of physics and a lot of physicists, people are kind of happily going on and doing their science and quite successfully and it has nothing to do with it and they get very, very annoyed when I hear people going on about the problems of string theory and as if that's some big problem for physics because it's not their problem.

Speaker 1:          32:00          String theory in particle physics suffers. I think a lot from the, from this business of being from its own success, from not having any, I'm not nobody kind of, it kind of has it. Has it been able to come up with any really good ideas to make positive progress just because there's been no experimental evidence to give you a clue as to which direction to go and that the subject is, I think traditionally been very connected often in, in at least from mathematicians point of view and very faddish way that everybody, all the smart people in the subject. The idea was it was, it would all kind of jump at the same problem and I'll try and work in the same problem very often because the, the subject was driven by experiment and you know, somebody would go out and turn on a new accelerator like the LSD at higher energy and this is certainly going to happen next year if the LHC is see something unexpected, everyone in the whole field is going to be trying to explain that one thing.

Speaker 1:          32:54          And so you have a very kind of, a little bit of kind of faddish sociology that everybody is trying to do, do the same thing at the same time. Or as in other fields like mathematics, people kind of spread out and develop expert their expertise and work on different things. So part of the problem of the politics of particle theory and has been that you have people used to the idea that well you should, you know, look around and see what these smart people are working on and I should work in the same thing as them. And so you've got, you have all these people kind of trying to do this. And so string theory then got identified back in 84 as being the hot topic. And for a lot of reasons, partly, um, you know, probably cause it was an intriguing idea, but, but partly also because one of the, uh, there's one of the great geniuses of our subject that Edward Whitton, who's a fantastic genius, has done these amazing things and you know, he got very interested in it and he started promoting the idea that this is a very promising idea.

Speaker 1:          33:54          And so everyone kind of jumped, jumped on it. And, uh, and, and, and my, my initial reaction at that time, that was, I was just getting out of graduate school at that time. And you know, my, my, partly the way I work and the way I think I, I wasn't so interested. The idea of trying to do it at the same thing as everybody else, I would prefer to work on something a bit different. And partly also, it didn't seem to me that, you know, it wasn't that this was obviously a good idea. It might be a good idea. I might not, but, but there were obvious problems with it from the beginning. And so anyways, so starting in [inaudible] 84, everybody started working on this and I think my reaction to it was, well, you know, that's great that they're doing this and what's going to happen is what normally happens in the subject is that after six months or a year or two years, people will see whether it's a good idea or not and you know, you, and if it's not a good idea, they'll, they'll move on.

Speaker 1:          34:46          And the really peculiar thing that happened here was that, you know, 25 years later, this is still, um, there's still a lot of people doing this. I mean, it, it, it, it really kind of caught fire and even without succeeding it, it's still kind of developed into this hole, into this huge subject. And, um, it kind of in some sense kind of achieves some kind of critical mass and more and more people were working on it and they're working on it for so long that people ended up kind of devoting their careers to it. And it's a very, very difficult and a very complicated subject. And, uh, it, it requires quite a lot of time just to even get to the point of understanding what's going on. So you had lots of want more and more people working on this for investing more and more of their time and their careers and their lives and it, and, and I think it really got to the unfortunate that people were kind of unwilling to kind of admit that this wasn't working. And it's a natural human reaction to an idea of your fond of that you put a lot into it to, it's kind of hard to get to, to get you to admit often wellmade this doesn't work. And, and, and this was kind of happening very much in spades in this story I think has been very hard to get people to kind of admit that this is something that hasn't worked out.

Speaker 1:          36:05          There's actually kind of two that, to kind of two things. What does the blog else I wrote wrote this book. And so the, um, anyway, for, for, for, for many years I was, I wasn't very happy with what was going on there and I was kind of observing, Kay, this is becoming more and more problematic. There's this, you know, not only are our people kind of not admitting that this isn't working out, but you know, there's this, there's this whole that, you know, there's a lot of kind of public promotion of the subject and, uh, and it's very difficult, complicated ethnography. A lot of people don't or don't understand it. And so it's, this is really not a healthy situation so that someone should kind of, you know, and kind of clearly explained to larger community of physicists and, and, and also at the non physicists, it, you know exactly what the situation is here.

Speaker 1:          36:48          And, uh, and so I, I wrote an article about this and then I finally wrote this book and it took, it took, it took a while to get the book publishers. That's a long and interesting story. But, but then while after, I guess it's after, after the book was written, I also started a, started to see, there were a couple of other physicists would started blogs. And I thought, well this is an interesting, interesting thing to try to do. And I can both talk about his issues related to string theory and things, which I was trying to get out through the book but also kind of follow it and on a day to day basis and also just kind of write about whatever I'm interested in. So the um, the blog, I, I guess I don't worry a lot about who about the, about the audience for it.

Speaker 1:          37:29          It's kind of written things. I realize it's very much, it's really just kind of whatever, whatever I would like to read. So I'm going to run, I'm kind of writing whenever I would like to read stuff to it. So if there's somebody out there exactly like me, they much find is really fascinating and if there's something quite different, they find it not at all interesting. And so, but because of that it's um, the kinds of things in the blog are often, you know, if I, if I learned something or something new, interesting going on and even in pure mathematics I'll be writing about that or pretty much anything going on in between mathematics and physics. They're writing about that, writing a lot about the LHC and um, and also just about whatever is going on in this controversy over string theory and had done, it's kind of, it's interesting that more kind of keeps happening without this, my book came out and there was at the same time there's a book by another physicist, um, with a similar point of view to mind and all came to that came out with that, that causes a lot of controversies with a lot of reviews and a lot of argument going on in these blogs.

Speaker 1:          38:25          And a lot of people refer to this as the string wars. And so the, there's this very, for for a year or two there, there was a kind of a right, interesting. If you're interested, it's kind of thing. There's an interesting warfare in terms of blog postings. And comments going on on my site and grey as others. And that was all sort of with, that would lead to all sorts of strange things.

Speaker 1:          38:49          Seven. And I mean I, it depends. I often learn interesting things from comment, you know, so, so now that the blog is fairly well known, so people will write in comments and I've logged off and telling me about something I hadn't heard about her new button you don't know about and that that's very interesting order. They'll, they'll often send it to me privately by email saying, hey, you might be interested in this. And so I get a lot of that. I learned a lot that way. Um, or what interesting thing I thought I'm using about the whole string theory thing discussion was that it say, uh,

Speaker 1:          39:21          it really is, it's an incredibly complex and difficult subject. And so it's really hard to over emphasize how it's a subject that really nobody understands very well. And even the people who are the most experts at it are. And it's amazing experience of having a conversation with some Nobel prize winners who people are thought of as the, the brightest people in this field and asking them what they think of the string theory and they'll say, no, I don't know. I don't really understand what's going on. I don't want to comment on it. And it's just, I'm baffled by it. So one interesting thing about the, some of these discussions and the blog was I found one way to have to figure out exactly what's going on in, in string theory and whether, you know, if something is really a problem or or not is to just put up my understanding of it, you know, in a blog posting or in a comment or whatever.

Speaker 1:          40:11          And then fairly quickly you would find that either, you know, either I was wrong and there, there was some reason that this actually made sense even though I thought it didn't and this would, I would, I would quickly, often abusive Leebee explained to me what an idiot I was and why this was, you know, here's the, here's the answer, what you really should have known or, and then then I found out that, okay, I learned something. Or, or, or often I would found out that if I was writing, if there really was a problem here, the answer I would get would often be just this abuse of, Oh, you know, you're a complete jerk and you're a moron and, but, but no, no, no scientific answer to, to the, to the scientific question. So, uh, that was one that was actually an interesting way to kind of see exactly what the state of research and the subject was by kind of probing it and trying to an egg and getting that kind of response from some of the more hostile people in the subject.

Speaker 2:          41:01          Okay.

Speaker 1:          41:09          I mean, I, it's mostly a positive thing. I mean, one thing to say about the w, one of the main problems with, with the blogs, one of the most annoying thing about the logs is, especially if, if, if a, if a lot of people are reading it, you're really in a situation where there's a small number of people who really understand this and know what's going on and have something really sensible to say about it. There's a very large number of people who have some kind of interest in it and you know, have the time and energy to sit there and write uninformed things on your blog and, and kind of just so, so I actually did, I think I'd like some logs actually delete a lot of the comments submitted to my blog and try to keep the noise level down. And, um, so, so, so that's the most, probably the most discouraging thing about the whole experience is just as the number of people out there who kind of want to go on about this and argue about this but don't know what they're talking about and want to kind of fill the internet and all information sources they get their hands on with kind of uninformed nonsense.

Speaker 1:          42:03          So there's a lot of that, but the, um, but, but, but just the kind of discussion of the other subject and have its problems, which I think went on in these blogs and which are in which, you know, if you're interested, you can now have an going to go and see and read. I don't think there's really any other form of, you know, it's an amazing format for that. There's really no other way that, you know, that discussion could, it could be held in that way. And um, and, and, and, and, and also, I mean the Internet just provides us amazing access to the information of a sort, which is just totally unlike anything we've had before. You can just google some term and immediately have access to all sorts of uh, often high level discussions of the subject. And um, I think the one, well it's actually made some of the um, faddishness of particle theory actually a bit worse in the sense that one thing that used to kind of slow down and fads was just the, how long it took to communicate them to people.

Speaker 1:          43:03          I mean, you know, the certain prominent people might have started working on some idea at Princeton or Harvard, but it would take a while for that news of that and understanding of what these people were doing to filter out to the rest of the community. And if people want it to kind of jump on it and pursue it in a faddish way, it would take them while to even find out about it. Whereas now everybody's kind of, every night there's a new set of preprints coming out in the pre print server and people logging in and looking at these. And the minute that somebody has some new thing, which is becoming a kind of faddish thing to work on, everybody throughout the world has it at exactly the same time when their desktop and can start thinking about it and working on it. And so it kind of makes that even more so than it used to be.

Speaker 3:          43:46          [inaudible].
