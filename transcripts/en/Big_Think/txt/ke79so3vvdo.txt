Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:04          I want to tell you one story, and the story came from the early 19 fifties, a woman named Wanda, Ruth Lunsford, who was the scientist in New York City and she published one paper which turned out to be our one paper in science, so we just actually push data science. What she did was she took an old rat in a young rat. She put him to sleep and she tied their skin together. So after about a day or so, their blood supplies joined. Well, several weeks later she looked in that old rat. There were new neurons growing in the brain, the heartbeat stronger, and the muscles were bigger. The gray hair term brown again, she claimed she reversed aging. People call her dracula or Frankenstein, all kinds of crazy names. Well, earlier this year, three separate laboratories at Harvard, Stanford University of California, San Francisco repeated the experiment and it worked, and what they showed is at age 25, and you and I are stem cells go to sleep and get turned off and proteins from young mice in this case or young humans can turn them back on again.

Speaker 2:          01:07          And when these stem cells get turned back on, new neurons can be growed, repair happens much quicker and tissue and tissue we all see read, our child breaks his leg. He or she are back walking again a couple of weeks. I don't even know what happened. Your grandmother breaks her leg and it hits her quality life the rest of her life. So there are clinical trials now using proteins that were founding young individuals to try to stimulate bone repair in the elderly who have fractures. And so just like a diabetic requires a shot of insulin so that they can manage their sugar going forward. If you break your leg in the elderly, we may just give you a shot of these proteins to turn back on your stem cells so you can repair quicker. We're trying it in cancer because cancer in kids is about 90 percent curable. Once you turn 25, that same cancer turns incurable. So maybe if I can give it to the body, it's younger. I can have a. We as a science community can have a bigger impact on cancer. So I leave you with that bit of hope, that aging is something that may be able to be reversed and not so we can live till I'm 150, but so that we can all live until our ninth or 10th decade without there being a decrease in quality in those last decades. Because that'd be the goal quality years till the end.
