Speaker 1:          00:02          I enjoy being a woman in science, different fields, what my field is one where I'm often working with mostly men, um, but, but there are more and more women coming into science and I think that there's a lot of issues around it. I'm actually involve them in the National Academy of Sciences Committee for Women in science and engineering and medicine and we spent a lot of time thinking about what were the issues. Um, and I think that there's very important transition points that we need to focus on. So a lot of women will do sciences, undergraduates, but then fall out going to graduate school and then there's a bigger follow that happens to postdoc. So why is it, is there this attrition? So, you know, really focusing on nurturing women through their transitions. Obviously there's a lot of cultural and biological differences with women and it makes it difficult because science is a very challenging job and you do have to make sacrifices and think about how can you do it in a way that will work for you.

Speaker 1:          00:56          So, um, yeah, I mean, I haven't, I've enjoyed it and I think that in general, um, people try really hard, they're just cultural differences that you have to understand and there's things I have to reckon with personally of how to do my science and be assertive but still be, you know, kind and assertive and all sorts of things and how to balance work and life and all of that. So, um, it's challenging and I think that there's a lot that can be done. I mean, we definitely can. I talk about in America that I feel like I can't speak for the rest of the world. I feel like in America there's lots of opportunity for women in science. It's not about the opportunity, it's about motivating women to enter science and a lot of the k through 12 education of getting them engaged earlier on, but then also supporting them, you know, supporting them through the transitions because no matter what we say there, so fundamental differences with trying to, you know, with the things that you have to contend with being a woman. Um, and so the opportunity is there, it's just the support systems need to do better.

Speaker 1:          02:01          I mean, I think that, you know, it's a lot of people say, and there's a couple of things, a lot of people say, um, you know, uh, like asked me how it is that I do, you know, I have an md and a phd and do research and also have an outside life and I'm, but you, no matter what, there's 24 hours in a day. So I don't like to pretend like, oh, it's just so easy. Like you make sacrifices and, you know, um, I wasn't being that healthy for awhile. I've regrouped and been like, okay, now I have to focus and you have to focus on the longterm. So going to the gym, doing the yoga and all sorts of things that you have to do in order to sustain yourself for your students and for everyone. So, um, there are challenges at every stage and um, it's easier to do when you really like what you do.

Speaker 1:          02:41          So that's, that's the important thing, right? Is the idea of liking it. Even when you're failing, it's failing in it and when it's hard and just just liking it in general, like you get a lot more energy and everyone knows that you have these sort of flexes of high energy and low energy and if you can maintain yourself in a place where you're always very focused and energetic and excited, then you can do a lot more. Um, and a lot of that comes with finding the thing that's your passion. So once you find your passion, the day to day gets a lot easier. So I love music and I would just do it anyway. Um, so whether I was in a band or not, like I write music all the time, so it's easy. It's not actually challenged in a lot of times I'm embarrassed to say like write songs, like on my bike ride to work.

Speaker 1:          03:20          That's the kind of thing that I do naturally and, and engage in. So it gives me time if I was to do something that was totally, you know, write a book that's out of my field and obviously that's a bigger sacrifice. Unless it was something where the ideas are just being for me and I was just really engaged in the process, so there is definitely challenges at every stage of being active and keeping it and sacrifices I've made. Like I, I've, I'm, I haven't started a family yet. I'd like to, but obviously the, the, when, when, and if I do, that's going to be another thing to bring into the mix, which is challenging.
