Speaker 1:          00:03          I hope it, I hope it comes out, um, intensely. Um, that's not to say that it's about me, that I, I think that, you know, conducting is obviously a visual activity because it's about showing things with your gesture to the musicians. But I don't want the audience to feel that they have to see a show from me in order to, to feel how exciting that the music is. Um, but on the other hand, if the music is exciting and if I look unengaged and not not in it, then that would certainly prevent the experience from being what it really should be. So it's a fine line that you have to sort of walk to, to really infuse the performance and the music with your deeply committed personality while allowing the music to still be paramount. It's a, it's a tricky thing and that's, uh, that's what we're all all going for.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Absolutely. I mean, I, you know, you have to allow your face to show the show the character of the music. But that's not something that I plan, you know, it's like you don't say, okay, well I want them to think I'm happy so I'll smile now. Um, you're naturally allow yourself to feel the music and then just as you, you know, when you're hanging out, you know, sometimes your face looks more serious. Sometimes it looks more animated, sometimes it looks more pensive. You, no, that's definitely part of the communication. It happens right away actually are. Hopefully it does. If it doesn't, then there's probably something wrong. Um, it's interesting. You can, you can, you can really understand the difference in orchestra, um, feels and conductors, if you go to a conducting class where there may be six or 10 or 12 conductors in a very short span of time, often it happens that these conductors will be doing the same music. So you have a really good basis of comparison. The sound is literally different within one second of instantly, once a new conductor comes on, they'll conduct the same music that had just been done by another conductor. The orchestra sounds completely different. It's uncanny. There's something in the body language that immediately translates into sound. And, uh, that's one of the exciting and kind of, uh,

Speaker 2:          02:24          amazing things about conducting.
