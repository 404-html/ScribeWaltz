Speaker 1:          00:06          To the infrastructure

Speaker 2:          00:09          sector, that's our greatest need. We plan to invest and this is a conservative estimate, $300,000,000,000 in the next few years into infrastructure. This will go into roads and airports, into the railways, into ports, and I would say to anybody going into infrastructure, because the need is there, it's recognized a lot of projects that have already been prepared. The government is, for example, a organizing mega power projects in which all the preliminary work will have been done by government of India itself and by the state government. So as soon as you go in, you can start putting up the power plant and we are an energy short country. We are short of a lot of power. And in order to sustain this kind of regional growth infrastructure is going to be the greatest challenge

Speaker 1:          01:05          for us. That's one of the most interesting phenomenon. The

Speaker 2:          01:14          Indian entrepreneurship or you have of course a lot of very highly recognizable names of Indian origin entrepreneurs in the United States itself. Uh, the head of Pepsi Co is an Indian woman in the head of the new head of Citi Group. Uh, Vikram Pandit is an Indian origin person. I'm the head of Roman Hoss, which has just been bought up as you know, I was an Indian origin person, Raj Gupta. These are examples really of Indians who have benefited from the fine American education and have had the opportunity but have grasped the opportunity to rise on the Indian side. Uh, we have a number of groups which have grown tremendously. Daughters is possibly the most well known, but also in forces. Wipro, the powdered forge group, Bobby Lloyd, I'm this, that in fact, if you looked at India and you look at the companies that are now our top 2015 of them didn't exist 15 years ago or 20 years ago. So you can see that there's a lot of new entrepreneurs and an interest. Another interesting phenomenon is that in the family owned businesses in India, we now have the second generation who is coming in to take over and run these companies. Most of them have had, uh, been to business schools in the United States or in India and they are running their business operations

Speaker 1:          02:59          nationally than was the case.
