Speaker 1:          00:07          One of the interesting things about healthcare today is the data is becoming unsiloed and increasingly accessible. So for example, I'm wearing right now a little patch will a company called vital connect or if my shirt, it's talking to my smartphone live and I can look at my dashboard and my data for my full, an ekg which will show up right here and it can track the trends and hopefully my ekg looks like, oh, it's okay. If there were any cardiologists out there, I could also see data about my steps, my stress level, my position. If I fall down and I don't get back up. Um, the, the, the, the system can tell that. And this is really an intensive care unit, like type level data. In a way it will be know less than $5 a day. Disposable Patch, which can be useful if you're training for a marathon.

Speaker 1:          00:48          If you're in a hospital and you're not on a monitored bed. If you're home with a disease like heart failure, that's a lot of data. We need to learn to sift through it and pull out the signals because no physician or nurse is going to want to be liable for watching your live streaming ekg, but is an immense amount of power and data and we're in this era now of creating digital health exhaust. You know, whether it's my smartwatch, this patch, my phone, it can tell a lot about me, my behaviors. If for example, you have a patient who's got bipolar disorder, you can tell from their phone whether they're depressed or they're manic. That can play a role in in smart disease disease management. We can take technologies like three d printing and tune homebase prosthetics. We can print prosthetic hands for folks and legs and the developing world.

Speaker 1:          01:34          Here's mini me and my pocket. It's a three d printed version of me that might be interesting if I need to make a prosthetic for someone who's lost part of their face or I was at mit media lab last week and met a young grad student who diagnosis ain't own brain cancer, written up in the New York Times and use three d printing to print a version of his tumor. Said, hey, you want a printer? Do you want to print in my brain tumor? This helped us surgeons do a better job of finding it and removing it, and he was proactive. He noticed some neurologic symptoms and pushed for his own. A repeat MRI that helped them get diagnosed earlier. I have in my pocket and new commercialized version of a brain computer interface from a company called interacts, so this is the muse. You can wear this headset and kind of use this for APA.

Speaker 1:          02:17          Find Mindfulness and meditation and I might use this to prescribe to a patient who has anxiety. Instead of giving them a drug, I give them a headset. Of course they can do meditation the old fashioned way, but this enables you to quantify it and have a bit of a feedback loop. So the ability to sort of quantify our own minds with brain computer interface like this can be used to treat everything from ptsd to Adhd. We're going to see use of video games to improve cognition or to treat disease. Um, we're seeing fancy brain computer interfaces from my Alma Mater, Brown, Brown university, to enable someone who's quadriplegic just by thinking to move a robotic limb and those are getting smaller and more integrated. And so the disabled in the future may just think move my arm and it'll be rewired back to the road arm. It benefit the spinal cord injury.

Speaker 1:          03:01          So lots of ways to take, you know, sometimes consumer devices, crowdsource new apps and platforms on these that will change, you know, neuroscience, psychiatry, and when we can pull this data together will become, become participatory in healthcare. We can move to an era, kind of like with Google maps, you donate some data when you use ways and Google maps through privacy, your speed and your location. But in exchange, you can build a map of your, of the streets and the traffic so you get some information back. I think we can have that same sensibility and healthcare, whether it's sharing your brainwaves, your genomics, or your wearable data, while maintaining privacy and optin abilities. Using that information can give us better public health, you know, better early signals if it's ebola coming or the common flu, or can enable patient groups to crowdsource better cures. For Crohn's disease, for example, there's this new world of the microbiome.

Speaker 1:          03:51          We have 10,000 times 10, 10 times more bacterial cells in an honorable in and on our bodies and our own human cells. We're learning that the microbiome plays a role in everything from obesity to inflammatory bowel disease, like Crohn's disease, maybe even some psychiatric disorders, and we're starting to be in this era of fecal transplants. And you can imagine in five, 10 years, you're going to get to and cocktail of a probiotic that's going to reboot your gi system to help treat diseases or prevent them. So a lot of these tools are gonna. Enable the clinician. You're going to be going to your corner, you know, pharmacy in many cases to get medical care or telemedicine. It's gonna enable you as an individual to own your own health information. There's already thousands of apps out there. Some are better than others, but you can use those as tools to stay engaged in taking your vitamin and your aspirin or being on top of a much more complex regimen.

Speaker 1:          04:40          And the challenge for all of us is to integrate these in the culture of health and medicine. You have the best technology, but unless your clinician uses it and gets paid for it, in some cases it may never be adapted. The payers of the world needs to start looking at how some of these can provide better outcomes at lower cost and even before they're fda approved. Bringing these to market and I think we're seeing many smart Pharma companies, payers, physician groups, think about how they layer these in to be the disrupter and not the disruptee.
