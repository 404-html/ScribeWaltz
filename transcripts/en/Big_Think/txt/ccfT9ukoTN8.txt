Speaker 1:          00:00          Every retail sales person in America just secretly wants to get through life without ever being accused of being a pushy salesperson. Um, and so the man in the desert story, um, you know, guys, there's a, there's a silly a story in the world, I mean, until I made it up because it's so silly, but the guy is, this guy lives on an oasis in the desert and he looks out one day and there's a man that's been obviously stranded in the desert for days, uh, uh, kind of, kind of approaching a serious, uh, you know, approaching death or something. He's like, well, and so what happens in retail, in the retail industry is people rush up to him and give him a glass of water. And then they, um, he drinks the water and they pat themselves on the back and the man of the desert wanders off some more and they're feeling great about themselves.

Speaker 1:          00:48          You know, that one, I got the guy a glass of water. And so we, there's so much more that you can do for him. You need to intuit his needs and you know, let's see. He needs more than water. He's been out there for days, he needs food. He, he might need electrolytes, not just a water. So let's give him some gatorade or you know, he needs to call his family and let them know that he's okay, you know, and, and not to mention Aloe Vera and all of that. So you're really the man in the desert. You're fulfilling his needs. Intuiting is nice and filling them, uh, through conversation and through it's hard work. Uh, but you know, you're, you're, you're doing all of that. Then you can feel good about yourself. Man and desert puts the moral imperative if you will, on selling rather than not selling somebody that really understands the mountain desert.

Speaker 1:          01:39          A story will understand that I'm selling and service for the same thing. We're not training people to sell up, sell this. Just help them in the true sense of the word. Just help the customer and the true sense of the word. And um, you can only help the customer and help the company or you can hurt the customer and hurt the company if you went out and give them a glass of water, then you're just kind of wimping out because you're afraid of being seen as a pushy salesperson. You're hurting the customer and in you're hurting the company. So if there's a woman in the container store, closet section and she's got a tie rack in one hand in a shoe rack and the other hand, I mean she obviously has a closet somewhere that's driving her crazy and, and you can conclude that fairly safely and if you let her get out of there with those two items, she's still got to have a closet, was driving her crazy, but the ties and the shoes will be a little bit better off, which you can do is, you know, causing interaction with her to find it and, and take a complete closet approach to really kind of redoing her whole closet.

Speaker 1:          02:46          And what that will usually lead up to is a customer that's vastly happier because she got a problem solved. She got her car and she's dancing in the closet because it's so perfect. That's what we're trying to get. We're trying to get what we call the customer dance. Then you have a really delighted customer who's coming back quickly who's so delighted with her closet that she's showing, um, her sister in law and her next door neighbor that closet and then they're coming in because they want, they want that feeling too, and they're like emotionally thrilled with this closet or pantry or toys towards solution or whatever. And that's how we build our business and an old market or a new market. And ultimately what people want is they want to feel emotional about the brands, about the prototype, this stuff home. And they live with it for a very long time and they either cus you every time they see it or they smile and they were very, very happy about it.

Speaker 1:          03:41          So we talk about that. You can get people to be emotional even about something as pedestrian as a trashcan. We probably have the world's, I think we have the world's best selection of trash cans and even a trash can can make you smile if you have this man in the desert interaction between customer and salesperson. She's got a lacquer trash cans so much as it fits in that corner perfectly. You love the way the pedal opens and closes, closes you're, you're actually kind of proud of your trash can. You're, you've considered showing it off to house gifts that you have over it stuff and proudly saying, no, that's my trash can. When you think about, you know, my trashcan, and that's man in the desert selling. You're just trying to help her figure out what she needs to feel that way. And uh, people want emotion.
