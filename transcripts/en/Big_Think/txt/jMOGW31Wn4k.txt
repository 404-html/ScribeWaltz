Speaker 1:          00:03          All the experts, by that I mean the NYP dea and the FBI agree I should be dead and somehow I managed to get through this horrendous experience. First of all, I stayed very calm. I stopped, I thought I listened. I didn't do anything without calculating the, the power and the impact of my words. For example, Stanley, it's your birthday. Wow. You deserve something nice for your birthday. How about a sexual favor for your birthday? Obviously they didn't use those words, but I won't say them on camera here. Um, and

Speaker 1:          00:46          going slow and being calm and thinking about it, I realized that if I said no, I might be very offensive. Why doesn't this lawyer? I think that our girls are good enough for him. So I was very careful to answer in a way to not offend. So I said, well, I'm sure the girls are lovely, but considering my circumstances, I'd really rather not made it seem light, but yet very respectful. And actually many hours later I had the opposite problem because they were smoking marijuana. They were in a good mood and I'm blindfolded with my own scarf covering most of my face and one of the men said, well, these, you know, Stanley, uh, I think these girls are starting to like you. They're looking at your lips. And that gave me the opposite problem because if we went down that path and their, their girlfriends liked me, they could get angry at me for the fact that their girlfriends like me.

Speaker 1:          01:44          So I had to deflect it in the opposite fashion. And I and I, and in that instance I used humor, which I think you have to use very carefully in these situations, but humor is another thing in the arsenal of, of a hostage, but only to be used sparingly and with great care. And I said, really the only reason these girls like me is because most of my faces covered. And they thought that was hysterical and they burst out laughing. Now, the fact is, if you use humor the wrong way, it can twist against you. For example, there was a point at which they, again, they are high on weed. They've had sex with the girls, this is the second time around. I was there for 25 hours and and they start, one of them started imitating a Jamaican accent. Well, I'm very good at doing all sorts of different accents and I pondered very carefully whether to go with it and go where they were and I made a decision to do it so I imitated my Jamaican accent for them and they loved that.

Speaker 1:          02:45          It was, it was hysterical to them. The thought that this polished pressed a Caucasian attorney could be imitating a Jamaican accent was was hysterical to them, but then they were talking about a store that was owned by Indians and I thought, well, should I do another kind of accent just to have some fun and keep things light? And I said, no, let me stop because I didn't know it and others. As long as I was doing an accident that they were doing, I thought, okay, that's far enough, but don't take it any further. You just don't know when they might twist against you. So I think survival skills stay very calm. Think, listen, observe, understand your circumstances. Also, give up your ego, give up who you are. I was a federal prosecutor in that position. I had considerable power in this position that I was in.

Speaker 1:          03:33          I had no power at all except the power of my wits, which I tried to get by with a but, but, but understand that you're no longer who you are. I'm in the situation and adjust to that. So that's another principle I would say for survival is to be very flexible. You know, getting the car guns pointed at me, you know, if I was inflexible, I might've started, you know, yelling, fighting, uh, all the detectives I spoke to say, listen, you can't second guess yourself Stanley, because you managed to survive. And I think because I was flexible I was able to go with the situation that helped me a lot. And another thing you need to do is feel some sense of empowerment. I mean, let's look at my thing, how much control that I have. I had seven people with automatic weapons on me who could have killed me at any moment and who might have killed me at any moment.

Speaker 1:          04:33          And I have no doubt in my mind, nor does the Myp dea or the FBI, that they were perfectly capable of doing it. Yet there were certain things where I felt I needed to keep control. For example, when I first went in, they invited me to take off my shoes. I said they put me down in a mattress. They took off my trench coat. I kept my sport jacket on, but they invited me to take off my shoes. And you know what I thought in my head, I thought a guy with his shoes off isn't walking out. Very powerful symbolism. So I said, no thanks. I'll leave them on because in my mind, and I think in the psychology of the room, a man with his shoes on could walk out, a man with his shoes off might not get the chance to walk out.

Speaker 1:          05:22          Or for example, uh, there was the point in time I purposely didn't ask to go to the bathroom. I didn't want to ask for anything that wasn't offered to me. But they eventually asked me if I needed to use the bathroom. I said yes. And as soon as I said just, they jumped up and sort of military alert cocking the guns, pointing them at me and it was, they were nervous that on the way to the bathroom I might pull something. So again, there I felt the need to maintain some control even though they've got the guns there, they're in control still. I wanted some small bit and I stopped and I said, Whoa, Whoa, whoa. I didn't even get up. I said, Whoa, hang on a second, relax. I'm not going to do anything. All I'm going to do is go to the bathroom. And they calm down. And then we went to the bathroom and I didn't get shot. Another example of maintaining some control was when I first got in there, they kept calling me, stephen and I kept saying, my name is Steven Stanley. They thought this was really funny. Oh, sorry. Stanley Stevens, the guy we did this to the other night and it turns out later they had actually taken him to the bank, not that the apartment gotten his money and then and then and then left him in the backseat of his own car.

Speaker 1:          06:38          I felt that it was very important not to be called Steven. I felt that it was important to be called by my correct name. My name is Stanley because my identity was my life. If I'm a real person with a real name, then you're less likely to kill me. And so I maintained that bit of control. So I think that's also to feel a sense of some empowerment. And if you. If you read the studies of posttraumatic stress disorder, what they say is that people get posttraumatic stress disorder because they felt the complete disempowerment. They felt the complete lack of control. I was in a situation that was out of my control for the most part, but where I could find it, I used it and also I gathered clues the whole time. So that to me, although purely psychological was a form of control for me to have. Um, so I think all those things helped me

Speaker 2:          07:36          survive.
