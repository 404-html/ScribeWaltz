Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          that we had a big party and lab had a lot of reporters came to get comments from people at Harvard. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:19          I think the, I'm really excited and because at Harvard, Harvard has a lot of private funding and so it's so some labs have projects that are less dependent on federal funding, but I think that lots of people in the US, there's thousands of universities, many of which are very bright people trying to advance stem cell research and that blockading federal money to those lab of toys. Villi hurts us a lot because we can't hope to bring queues into market. I think by just having pilot funding to universities and corporate funding for pharmaceuticals and that I'm really excited now that our current president is looking forward to trying to um, jumpstart stem cell research and biomedical research as whole. And I think that

Speaker 2:          01:10          as this money gets spread around the country, that we will see a lot of people from different universities and institutions publishing a lot of good work that's really going to move us forward. I'm really excited that this is going on. I think that while the first FDA trials, clinical trials for stamps was a going on now with spinal cord injury, um, that many of my colleagues and friends and I agree that it will be decades before this becomes a more prevalent trend. And I think that looking at the current, um, current drugs for pharmaceutical companies, it can take maybe on a scale of 10 years and a billion dollars to get a drug all the way to market. And so I think that means that for the stem cell studies are being done it now in mice, that it will take at least at the very minimum, a decade, much more to be able to get those to humans.

Speaker 2:          02:05          I think the fact is we're so comfortable with taking pills or taking shots, but when gene therapy came around, no one was too excited about putting viruses into the body. And I think that right now people aren't too thrilled about putting stem cells with stem cell derived cells into someone's body. And I think that it's really important that we try to take this slow and be careful and make sure that nothing that we can ultimately, hi a person, that these stem cells won't hurt anyone. And I think it definitely will take decades. And I guess maybe as my generation gets older, we'll see stem cells come around because there's a big interest in them and lots of people interested. But I think that it's something in the near foreseeable future but not but definitely not now. And that the future was definitely going to bring a lot. And I'm really excited to see how it.
