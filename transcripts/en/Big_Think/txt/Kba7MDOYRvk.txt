Speaker 1:          00:13          All families, all families have conflict, successful families actually illimited and move on to actually building positive memories, so how do you do that? I took a three day course from the folks at the Harvard negotiation project thinking they work with Israelis and Palestinians and general strikes in emerging markets. Let's find out what they know to bring peace and this changed a lot about how my wife and I, we used to have what I call it, 7:40 to fight every night the kids would be down and we would talk about who's picking up the milk, who's buying the tickets for vacation, and it would always just ended a model with my wife storming out of the room and what I learned was a number of things. First of all, I changed when we have these conversations. Highest stress time and families is between six and eight at night, so 7:42 PM.

Speaker 1:          01:03          The worst time you can have one of these fights, so we no longer have difficult conversations during this period. Second, I changed where we fight. I would be at my desk surrounded by my computer equipment, a pie. My wife would be lower, she'd be her arms crossed, resentful. Turns out I was in the power position, so now when we have difficult conversations, we sit at the same level. We actually, if we're having a really difficult conversation, have moved to our bedroom, to a bench that we have this cushion because research shows if you're sitting on a cushion bench will be more open alongside each other. You'll be collaborative across from each other, more confrontational. The point is there's all these new ideas out there about reducing conflict, so let's bring them into families. Some may be right for your family, some may not, but I'd be surprised if you couldn't fight smarter after reading some of these tips. For example, one thing, worst thing you can say on a fight, is it I is that we? Is it you or is it your mother? Your mother and I may not be great, but you turned out to be the worst thing you can say in a fight. You always do this. You'd never do that. Speak about yourself. Speak about us as a couple, but if you want to stop fighting, stop saying you.

Speaker 1:          02:20          So let's talk about things that can go wrong in families. Even if the adults are fighting smarter. The kids are probably getting into a lot of disputes and they seem incredibly petty to parents, but the truth is even those petty discussions and in my house, it can be socks in your house. It might be who's staying up later. It might be who's getting to sit in what chair? So here's what I've learned is simple three step process that can reduce sibling fighting. Number one, separate them, they're in the middle of the conflict. Separate them. Give everyone a chance to calm down and reflect a little, not only on what the other person did, but on what they. Step two, and this is the most important, have kids come up with two or three alternatives. Usually the first one is going to be the one that they've come up with and they may stick to that for a few minutes, but after awhile they'll come up with two or three alternatives.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Then you bring the siblings back together. At that point, there's four or five alternatives on the table and nine times out of 10, one of those alternatives overlaps with another and the kids are beginning to solve the problem. Again, the key here is to give your kids the tools that they need to solve the problems themselves. I used to think, oh, don't be referee. Let the kids solve the problems, but the truth is you need to teach them the skills. You can't just expect them to learn it. Teach them the skills so they can solve the problems. When you're not.
