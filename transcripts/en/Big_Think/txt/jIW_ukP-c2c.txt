Speaker 1:          00:09          Yeah. One of the things that, the question of what's uniquely humans is actually a big one. Um, and you, depending on who you ask, you might get really different answers. If I had to put my money on something that was actually uniquely human, it seems in some funny way to be our motivation to actually interact with others in a funny way. And what I mean by this is that, uh, you know, generally if you look at any humans anywhere, if they're hanging out with other humans, they're often doing something where they're showing something to another individual. So you see something cool, you say, Oh hey, look at this cool thing and to psychologist this is this process of reference, right? Sort of share referring to information out there in a world. And it seems like other primates, even though you think this is kind of a simple ability, they seem to lack at least the motivation to do this. Um, this leads to the fact that they don't have the kind of communication that we have your things like language with now. And so it can kind of point to things out there. In the world. Um, they also don't seem to share their own desires and intentions with others, which leads to a lack of kind of cooperation and a lot of domains. So, so if I had to put my money on what was uniquely human, I'd, I'd go with a kind of motivation to share information with others.
