Speaker 1:          00:07          I surely hope so. I mean, it's, it's a, it's inevitable that change will come. Uh, I hope it comes soon enough and, uh, and that the Cubans end up being free enough because right now we're going to see, it'd be tough for them to just suddenly be thrown into, you know, a whole new world that they don't know. So was going to have to happen little by little. Uh, but I do hope that they do that they do experience freedom. And that's when I would love to perform there in a day where I don't have to ask the government permission or have anybody take repressive measures about in any of our me, against the audience, against anyone. And I would need that. I would need them to be completely free. It's happening. It's gonna happen. It's just for none of us. It's soon enough, but as long as it's in the best way for them.
