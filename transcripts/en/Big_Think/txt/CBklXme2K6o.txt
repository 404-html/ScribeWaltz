Speaker 1:          00:06          We have a band called racket, which, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:12          it's a rock and roll band and it was set up by myself and a fellow called Nigel Smith who's a scholar of English literature in particular a marvel and Milton. He does some work and him used to teach at Oxford. I met him in Oxford actually when I was a professor poetry at Oxford and he was the head of the English department at Oxford United Teachers at Princeton. So He's, he's a very, very serious scholar, but behind it all he's a rocker. And um, so he and I got together and we started. I have always been interested in trying to write songs I just

Speaker 2:          00:59          would love to be able to do it was quite a difficult thing to do also. But anyway, we got together and we set up with a band, been a couple of versions of it, but the present version of a great guitarist and lead singer called Matthew as a music scholar. Um, and then, uh, we have, uh, Steven Alan who's an entertainment lawyer, but a trained musician, one of the Berkeley College of music. And then our drummer, Bobby Lewis as a also studied music at, uh, the College of New Jersey, Trenton. So they're all, they're all quite wonderful musicians. But this bit's rock'n'roll. So rock and roll with the way. Hope you know, Demi, Sammy,

Speaker 2:          01:53          Tammy semi. Interesting. Merrick's we're hoping. We're hoping that's the idea. So that combination and uh, you know, we keep plugging away at it. And a no, we do it for fun to a large extent, but we also were somewhat areas, not in the sense that we're expected who playing Madison Square Garden any day soon though. Mind you if there's anyone from Madison Square Garden listening, you know, you should think about is um, and um, you know, we have to be realistic about that. Uh, I, I suppose that a fixed but 56 year old like myself shouldn't be cherishing even the remotest notion of that. But then I think Mick Jagger, Mick Jagger's in slightly better shape than I am as A. Anyway, I'm back to the treadmill. I write the lyrics. That's my main role. I write the lyrics and I play the odd some sometimes ms dot calculated chord on a guitar, but you know, I do so with Breo or certainly the attempt, the attempt a of a Breo. I love it. I mean it's just, it's so much fun. It's so much fun. And the band actually is great. I mean it's, it's, it's the standard one side. We're praising myself, but I'd said they're quite brilliant really.
