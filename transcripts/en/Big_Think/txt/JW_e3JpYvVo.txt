Speaker 1:          00:14          A few important things that patients need to do in order to prevent a recurrence? Um, well the first thing is to really manage, you know, your own follow up appointments. I think there's a few of us that were surprised that doctors don't send that little card out in the mail to remind you, like a dentist used to do, uh, to remind you of those followup appointments. It's your responsibility to manage those and you've got several doctors appointments to follow up depending on the type of a treatment. For me, I had to, to follow up with my surgeon and oncologist, my radiologist and a for a while first year and my plastic surgeon. Uh, so there were several appointments that I needed to, to manage and monitor. And that is critical that you stay on top of that. They're not going to call and remind you it's, uh, doesn't happen and a, so it's your responsibility.

Speaker 1:          01:08          I also believe that changing your lifestyle is important. This isn't the lifestyle you have had cancer. It's over. You're done. We're hair starts to grow back and you start to feel better and healthy and your life moves on. But at the end of the day you had cancer and it's now lifestyle that you need to monitor and manage. That means, uh, you know, looking at your diet and eating healthy foods. Um, there's been a big link to um, uh, having, having extra weight and, and fat in the Diet and on your body, a linking with cancer. So being healthy and eating well, exercise. Um, and just being very cognizant of how you're, you feel on a day to day basis, how your body feels and recognizing any potential symptoms to, you know, make that phone call. If there's any concern.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Well, I'll tell you, I definitely treated this cancer a little differently than the first one. I knew to take care of myself. I need to stay positive. I need to wait to find out all the information. Uh, when I went to see my doctors before I panicked, before I went to the website. So I implemented everything that I, uh, you know, from experience. I, I did exactly what I tell everybody else to do. I followed the rules. I called my insurance insurance carrier. I, uh, made sure to have all my questions ready before and prepare it before my doctor's appointments. I had all my paperwork and my slides, pathology report. I, uh, asked all the questions and had several opinions before we went ahead and made the final decision of the ta type of treatment that I would, uh, take on. So, and even going through the process, like, I hate to say it, but a variant cancer, I thought, you know, I had breast cancer. I know what the surgery is going to be like. I've had that. I've, you know, I've, I've had chemotherapy. Well, it was

Speaker 2:          03:17          okay

Speaker 1:          03:17          about 10 times harder, uh, with the surgery and the chemo. That was a bit of a surprise. But the process remains exactly how I knew to get through it. And I was able to stay positive and keep my family from panicking and my friends from panicking, which is unfortunately one of the jobs that are not, uh, sometimes we end up taking on is keeping everybody else calm. Um, when your friends and families start to really panic. But I was very lucky. I got again, an opportunity to see some wonderful doctors I had. Um, I what else?

Speaker 2:          03:56          Um,

Speaker 1:          03:59          I have my counselor one on one planner and Aye. Aye. Aye.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          04:04          just before I was about to go to pressed as to prepare this planner for people with breast cancer, I had to stop the process where we're at in the middle of editing and about to send it to the printer. And I grabbed the prototype and I used it and I though it was designed for people with breast cancer. I was the organizer component. Um, that really got me through the process and was able to keep me calm and focused about my next steps. I had a place to put all my appointments, my notes, my business cards, and it really helped my mother who was flew in from Chicago to be with me. You know, as a mother, she was just devastated. So I think the plan are really kept us both organized and everything. All our notes were in one place where we could share this book together.
