Speaker 1:          00:08          Okay. There were some very definite, uh, qualities to good leaders will. One is decisiveness. If you have decision anxiety, it kind of says that you don't have confidence and people are frightened to be led by somebody who doesn't have confidence, doesn't appear to know the direction that the company is going. And you know, you always want to get in the trenches with somebody who you think is going to win the battle. And so confidence and is very big part of leadership being decisive. I think having, um, a sense of compassion is also important for leadership because you can order somebody to come in on the weekends and work over time, but you can't make them come up with their best ideas. They have to do that because they care about you and they want to please you in. And you're a leader that motivates that kind of passion in them. If you don't do that, if you're just leading by being a dictator or by fear, um, eventually it's going to come back to, you know, bite you where you don't want to be better and you won't get the kind of dedication that you are looking right.
