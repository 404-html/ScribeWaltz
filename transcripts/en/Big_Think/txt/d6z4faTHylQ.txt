Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, I actually am the founder of the founder is a guy named Steve Hindi. Uh, who founded it with his, uh, his neighbor, Tom Potter. And Steve had been a reporter in the Middle East. Uh, you know, he knew all the major players over there from Yasser Arafat too, you know, uh, uh, all the people that, that, that really were the main people on the stage back in the seventies and eighties. And when he worked over in the Middle East, they often, the journalists would make their own beer when they were in station places that didn't allow alcohol. So through that he fell in love with brewing, came back to the United States and was brewing with his neighbor who was a banker and it was a commercial bank loan officer and they got together and started Brooklyn brewery in 1988. Uh, I came on in 1994 to build the new brewery in Brooklyn and to expand from the tube or beers that they had back then to the 15 or 16 and a year that we create right now. Um, so, uh, I've been with the brewery for 14 years now.

Speaker 1:          01:17          No, they're all kind of like, you know, my, my children, you know, you guys like, oh, which is the, which is your favorite child. Um, now some days you might actually have an answer for that question and that would be true, I think of the beers as well. But if you asked me in the middle of winter, you're going to get a completely different answer than you're going to get on a hot day in summer. If you asked me on a boat, you'll get a different answer than you get in my house. It really depends on what I'm having for dinner. So, um, I think of the beers as all having their particular talents and it's just about like what mood I man at any particular time voted to me more likely we fear or a Pilsner, cause I'm probably going to be having a number of them. I don't want anything, uh, you know, two heavy. Um, but, uh, and I, and I, I like, I like the sharp, bitter flavor of, uh, of the pills and there, so I'm probably gonna lean in that direction. Well, it depends on before or after dinner, before dinner or with dinner. It's Brown Ale was after dinner, then it's going to be our black chocolates out.

Speaker 2:          02:27          Wow.

Speaker 1:          02:27          In my case, it'll be a rooftop in Brooklyn. Um, but, uh, and I do have 800, a big 800 square foot roof and a these days it's totally been our, uh, Brooklyn local one, which is, uh, uh, you know, the one that we're doing the bottle re fermentation on, you know, it's 9%. So you have to be careful about the stairs as you go back down from the roof. But, uh, you know, we, we've been having a very good time with that, uh, in the last year

Speaker 2:          02:56          Brooklyn lager because that's probably

Speaker 1:          03:00          why, uh, you know, at least for us, you know, that's, that's our, that's our flagship. Uh, that's our flagship beer. It's the beer that we're, we're probably best known for. And a, and thankfully, almost anywhere you go, especially downtown in New York City, you're going to see a Brooklyn lager. And, uh, you know, and, uh, we, we still love it. I think

Speaker 2:          03:18          it's a great beer.
