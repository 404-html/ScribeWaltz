Speaker 1:          00:00          And some of you may be wondering whether you're actually in a relationship with a psychopath or whether the youth, you might've fallen for a psychopath in the past. And if you are in a relationship with a psychopath, a what you can do about that. Now, uh, psychopaths do have certain characteristics. Certain tells a, to use a poker analogy, a that they display in relationships. Um, they tend to play on our pity a lot. Okay? So they tend to excuse they're misdemeanors and bad behaviors, um, through something that would be on their control. They couldn't help doing it because you know, something had happened and you know, there's always an excuse for it. And all those psychopaths don't feel emotions like us. They are masters at pushing those emotional hot buttons that elicit emotions in, in, in others, in us. Uh, sympathy being one of the major, major motivators.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Okay. A psychopath also tend to be very narcissistic. Um, they tend to think that the world centers around them. They're not really attuned to your feelings. They don't really care about your feelings. Uh, really, ultimately the world, uh, surrounds a, surrounds them a solid psychopathic, also very charming. They're very manipulative, especially when they're in a crowd, especially when they're in company. Uh, but behind the scenes when they're alone with you, they can be very, very controlling sometimes, but not always aggressive, but psychologically controlling as well. Okay. So if you're worried about the fact, if you're worried that your, uh, you know, in, in a relationship with a psychopath, what can you do about that? What might be some certain things to, to look out for? Well, first of all, the absolute first thing to do is, uh, to not go on face value, to not fall for the smokescreen.

Speaker 1:          01:54          Okay? Uh, number one rule of thumb is to don't judge a person on what they say, but judge a person on what they do. Okay? So that's the very first thing. Look at the evidence of their behavior and try to judge it objectively rather than subjectively. Not An easy thing to do. I admit. If you're in a relationship with someone. Secondly, if you suspect that your partner is a psychopath, why don't you get a second opinion from one of your friends? Why don't you confide in your friends? I think my partner is a psychopath or I think these, are there certain characteristics? Give me an honest opinion. What do you really think about my partner? Okay. And a second opinion. Two heads are often better than one in this kind of case. Thirdly, numb. A golden rule is don't cover for them if they start getting into serious trouble and they want you to somehow front up for them or be an alibi or somehow make excuses or whatever, whatever. Don't get tangled up into covering up for them because as soon as that starts happening, it's called the foot in the door technique. A very, very common persuasive technique. Once you've done something for someone, you're more likely to do other followup things for them. And before you know it, your in, up to your neck. Okay. And the fourth thing I would say is buy my book, uh, because all the, uh, all the signs and all the tricks of the trainer in there. Uh, and fore warned is definitely forearm when you're dealing with sign up.
