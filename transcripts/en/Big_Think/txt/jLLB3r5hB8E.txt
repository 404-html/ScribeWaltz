Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, the first step, the reason why I use the East West paradigm is because the West has dominated world history for 200 years and that's been the prevailing narrative for 200 years. That narrative is coming to an end. So it's important to emphasize that that's the one night is coming to an end now the Eco, right? It's absolutely diverse. She's remarkably diverse. I mean, China and India you mentioned are very different, but what most western minds don't realize is that in previous centuries there were a lot of connections among the Asian countries. Fairly deep connection. To illustrate this with my Mike Best of case, now I'm ethnically cindy. Cindy is a province in Pakistan and my religion, I was born a Hindu. Okay. Yet when I grew up, the script that I learned to write with as a Hindu, the right cindy is the Arabic script and it shows the connection, the Hindu, Cindy's halfway the Islamic world, you know, in Arab, in, in, in, in the Arab world and in pressure.

Speaker 1:          01:19          And at the same time when I traveled to the East Asia, when I go to Japan, when I go to Korea, when I go to China, I still feel a sense of cultural affinity because I can, I feel like an understand the Buddhist cultures that revealing those societies because what does it came from India and I had some Buddhists influence, uh, in my life too as a child. So, you know, you can see that in my personal case, if I can personally feel connected with West Asia. Okay. If you personally connected with East Asia, that's an illustration of how Aisha comes together in many ways that is not understood by the West.
