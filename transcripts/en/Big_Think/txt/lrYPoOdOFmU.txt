Speaker 1:          00:09          My mother raised us on real food and she was a fan of Adele Davis who was the pioneering slightly out of the mainstream nutritionist, but a lay woman, right. And so then, then a lot of people attacked her for not knowing enough, uh, who came out of California, um, in the sixties and seventies. She had a pretty big following and Adele Davis had very simple principles, all of which have been pretty much born out by the, by the subsequent science, wholefood b vitamins, real meat, real milk, um, traditional fats. She has a few clunkers that don't survive the test of time, which you come across in her books. But on the whole, everything, everything she said prove to be true. And so my mother raised us on whole wheat bread and, uh, the proverbial black strap, molasses. We made granola once a week. The children had, uh, an assignment to make granola.

Speaker 1:          01:02          Um, we also ate all the meats. It was not a Vegan hit becoming our little farm. Um, so we had very traditional simple American meals, like fried chicken, meatloaf. Um, I remember, uh, uh, food I regard as one of our super frugal meals was macaroni with tuna and cream sauce, which I loved. Um, my mother used to dip her toast in the bacon fat and nothing was off limits, um, except white sugar and white flour. Those would have been my mother's standards. And she used to say, no matter how little money we have will always have real maple syrup, real olive oil and real butter. We also had a cow and chickens. And in addition to the vegetables, we were growing our vegetable farm. So we drank raw milk. We didn't make any cheese or dairy products. Um, that would have been more homesteady than we were. And we were really busy as commercial vegetable farmers, but we did have fresh eggs and fresh milk. And then what we couldn't raise ourselves, we bought or bartered for the farmer's markets. And in the dead of winter, we shopped at the supermarkets.

Speaker 1:          02:10          My concept of real food was grounded in my mother's lessons for us. Um, uh, which were that it should be whole, it should be traditional. It should be simple, shouldn't be processed, a small number of ingredients. Um, and then I sort of went off track and, uh, in my teens and 20s, became a Vegan and a vegetarian and tried to low fat diets and low saturated fat diets and low cholesterol diets. And, um, the, and, and the reason I did that is it was not so much their thumb in the face of my mother, although perhaps we're, we're all acting against our parents in some ways. Um, but more because it was, um, the conventional wisdom of the time in the late eighties and the early 1990s that less fat was good, less saturated fat, good less animal fat, less cholesterol, more plant foods. So I assumed that if all those things were true, that, um, a nonfat Vegan diet was probably the best of all.

Speaker 1:          03:11          Um, and, and that's what I tried and, uh, things went, went along fine. No one would have called me sick. Um, but on Vegan and low fat diets, in fact, my health suffered and I was 25 pounds heavier than I am now. And I had a host of minor minor complaints, um, and, and no one really would have ever called me ill or, or certainly they wouldn't have suspected my perfect diet because I was not a junk food vegan or vegetarian. I had brown rice and beans. I, olive oil, light fruits and vegetables. Um, I just didn't eat, um, many traditional foods. How, how I now understand it. So what brought me back to real food, um, was, was a wonderful serendipity. I was living in London and I had started the first American style farmer's markets in London in 1999 and when I grew up in the, in the Washington dc area, at the farmer's markets, there were the vegetable people like us and the fruit guys.

Speaker 1:          04:13          And then there was the plant lady and the honey man and the baker at farmers markets. When I started my first little farmer's market in London, I had farmers even at my first little market with only 16 producers selling grass fed and pastured beef and lamb and pork and chicken. They were selling raw milk cheeses and cream and um, and sausages and meat pies. And fish and all sorts of wonderful things. So then I got a book contract and that was to write the farmers' market cookbook. And I had just been dabbling around with eggs and with fish. And I was no longer Vegan and no longer a vegetarian, but I wasn't eating. I was not yet a carnivore or an omnivore even. And so I didn't want to write a vegetarian or even a fish and eggs farmers' market cookbook. I felt I had to honor all the food producers at the markets.

Speaker 1:          05:08          And we'll the eaters as well. So I, I looked around and I saw that the, the farmers have these wonderful traditional foods, the meat, eggs, dairy, the fats, um, we're healthy and happy people and seem to enjoy their food. And, and the eaters were healthy and happy people and to certainly enjoyed all those foods. And I began to wonder whether I shouldn't try these foods. So for my cookbook, I tried every food at our markets and wrote recipes and ate all the recipes. And it was along the way that I slowly became a, an omnivore again. Um, and with each food I ate with each fat, with each rich thing, with each red meat, with each forbidden and taboo thing. Would g w with each item that the cardiologists were banning, um, in the u s and in Britain as well, my health improved quite dramatically. I lost 25 pounds. I didn't have to exercise as much. I used to run six miles, six, six times a week. I'd colds and flu and flu season. My nails and hair and skin were dry. My digestion was terrible. All of those problems melted away. When, when I became an element of Oregon.
