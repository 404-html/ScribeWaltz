Speaker 1:          00:06          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:09          Noncommunicable diseases are the diseases that you and I are most familiar with. There are things like diabetes and heart disease and unfortunately I think that if you run your hand over the planet, you'll see that in the poorest countries there's extremely little that's being done across these dimensions. These diseases are not getting the attention that they deserve and yet they are becoming a larger and larger piece of the puzzle of public health. So in Rwanda and Kenya and Ethiopia and a number of countries where I've worked over the years, we've seen large numbers of new type one and type two diabetes coming through the door. Just a couple months ago, I was out at a health center where a man who was suffering with type one diabetes was actually living at the health center because he didn't have the authority to provide himself with daily injections of insulin. Of course, this would never happen in the u s or in a rich country.

Speaker 2:          01:09          He'd get his needles and he'd get his insulin and he'd be able to inject himself at home. But where there is care that's given, it's given without very much instruction or very much knowledge of these diseases. One of the perhaps best interventions that we can make as a world today in the area of public health is around these noncommunicable diseases. We've actually got to start taking a look at heart disease and poor countries. I know that in China for example, heart disease has become one of the top killers in Rwanda, in sub Saharan Africa. Uh, heart disease is a major killer, but it's a bit of a silent killer because people haven't attracted over the years it hasn't been as interesting, nor has it attracted as much donor dollars as something like aids, tuberculosis or malaria. And yet it's still claiming a huge number of lives and a lot of productivity. Even though we don't have the best of baseline data, we do know that the impact is enormous, and we know that with changing diets and poor countries with urbanization, with increase in smoking and basically bad rich country habits, people are going to be getting sicker and sicker earlier and earlier, and now is the time to really prevent this disease, which is going to be the next wave of pandemic that hits the way
