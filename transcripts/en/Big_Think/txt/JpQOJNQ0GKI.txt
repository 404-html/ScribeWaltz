Speaker 1:          00:04          All right

Speaker 2:          00:12          from the age of five onwards. So it was one of the earliest things I started to read when I started to read. And, uh, it was very much part of my consciousness in the beginning. I saw the Bhagavad Gita is a text that was very classical, most like the Iliad and the Odyssey, a mythical saga that showed the eternal conflict between good and evil. But much later as I grew up, I realized that it was much more than that. It what it was an examination of consciousness and the desire of human beings or the quest that we have as human beings to understand ourselves. That it was the map you might say, for exploring the territory. And that leads us to find out things about ourselves. Who are we? Where do we come from? What's the meaning and purpose of our existence? Uh, do we have a soul?

Speaker 2:          01:20          What happens to us after we die? Does God Exist? Does God in fact care about us? How can we get in touch with that source that we call consciousness is the consciousness behind our thoughts. Also the consciousness responsible for all the intelligent activity of the universe. The bhagavad Gita is actually a very good text for Yoga, the Yoga of love, the Yoga of action or Karma, the yoga of understanding or intellect and the yoga of reflection and meditation. So I think it's a very important a map for understanding the nature of consciousness. The word Yoga is the same as the English Word York. Uh, so in the New Testament when Jesus Christ says, my yoke is easy and my burden is light, my interpretation is that he's referring to yoga. It Means Union, Union of the body, mind and spirit as one continuum of consciousness. I think the Bhagavad Gita is about, um, both are the forces of light and the forces of darkness that exists within our own self, within our own soul, that our deepest nature is one of ambiguity.

Speaker 2:          02:50          We have evolutionary forces, their forces of creativity and love and compassion and understanding. But we also have darkness inside us. The diabolical forces of separation, fear and delusion. And a, in most of our lives, there's a battle going on within ourselves between the sacred and the profane, between the evolutionary impulses and the destructive tendencies that we have between creativity on the one hand and addictive behavior. On the other hand, between the divine and the Diabolico between the light and the shadow between the sacred and the profane. So the [inaudible] Gita is a, an understanding of this battle that we have in our consciousness that ultimately is played out in the battlefield, as you recall, our physical bodies in the physical universe. So by understanding the dynamics of these forces within our own consciousness and by beginning to harmonize our impulses with the evolutionary impulse within us, we heal ourselves.

Speaker 2:          04:07          And in doing so, we heal not only our physical bodies but our world because the world that we find ourselves in is a projection both of our personal consciousness and our collective consciousness. So I think it's very relevant to modern times when you see things like global warming and climate chaos and changing weather patterns and natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina and extreme poverty and economic disparities and social injustice and war. And terrorism. These are the projection or the collective consciousness that's in disarray of a collective consciousness where there is a rift in the collective soul, a collective consciousness that, uh, is evolving. But, um, he was going through a lunch.
