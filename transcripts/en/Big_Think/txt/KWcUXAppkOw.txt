Speaker 1:          00:03          My name is Neil Martin. Um, my title is I like to be known. I am a author of habit. The 95% of behavior marketers ignore. And I am the founder and CEO of intellect, a consulting company in Atlanta. The real idea just came from watching my daughter use her cell phone, you know, teenager, you know, on the couch right beside the landline phone and you know, something occurred to her. She was online and she just whips her cell phone out and called a friend. And you know, the parent in me reacted like all parents do like wait a second, that one cost me money, the other one's free, you know, use that one. But then I realized that what she had done, she had done unconsciously and it was a habit. And so I do a lot of work with communications companies and I really started thinking about that idea about, you know, what we do unconsciously might explain a lot, a lot of the big problems with marketing. So when I did my phd in marketing was on customer satisfaction, and it was, you know, did all this research tonight, you know, all this complicated mathematical modeling. And then I did this, you know, large scale analysis of all this research and discovered that customer satisfaction tells us almost nothing so that if I know how satisfied you are, I cannot predict what you're going to do it.
