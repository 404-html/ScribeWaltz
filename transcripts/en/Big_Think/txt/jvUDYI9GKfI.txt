Speaker 1:          00:05          There's a lot of interesting new technology that scrubs job descriptions for gendered words because the layer, literally the ways that companies are presenting opportunities is screening out women are self screening out because they're seeing words that they don't relate to, uh, resonate. Absolutely. Absolutely. So there's literally like technology is going to have to help us shortcut our biases because we are so unfortunately kind of hopeless when it comes to. It's true with me, it's really hard wired into us to be biased against maybe ourselves and believing the stereotypes we hear, uh, but then also particularly bias coming out us of course, from folks who have not done the work around, you know, their own choices. Right? Getting us into boxes. So I want to know from you, so when you experienced in your career, maybe some stereotype threat and how did you correct for it?

Speaker 1:          00:57          When you know that it may be being applied to Ya, how do you not get swamped by that? It's like the death by a thousand cuts, you know, it's, it does accumulate and then it causes a lot of us frankly, to leave organizations. Absolutely. Like we don't even, we can't even put a death, a fine point on it, but we feel, don't feel valued and heard and welcomed. Right? So how did you overcome that and kind of claim your power and. Yeah, that's in line with a question. Um, so first by way of background as a professor at Columbia and the first African American to ever be tenured in the sciences since, you know, since, since Columbia started, so that says a lot. So that says, I think it's incredible achievement, but also says a lot about, about, uh, about even where, where we are today because people think I don't struggle.

Speaker 1:          01:46          I struggle every single day. I have perfectionistic syndrome where I work on an article for a year and then I work on it for another year and I know the literature that women are more likely to do that, that perfectionistic syndrome is linked to being worried about being stereotyped. I, um, make lots of decisions where, where I, I think very carefully about how I am perceived by others. And oftentimes I'll be in say a faculty meeting or even when I'm talking to companies and senior leaders and I'm like, well, how many common should I make about race versus gender versus religion? Like am I being seen as too this or too that. So I worry about these things all the time. But a couple of things I know to be true. One is that when you take calculated risks, you know, and you of put yourself a little bit out there, almost always something amazing happens.

Speaker 1:          02:43          And so that is one thing that I've learned to. I really believe that the whole diversity and inclusion architecture, people don't understand the underlying science and when they understand that it's not about bad people doing bad things, but about these structural differences, it sort of gives me hope. And that helps me take these calculated risks. And I think the third thing is just me personally knowing like I will feel anxiety every time I sit down to write a paper and I go, I'm the first African American tenured in the sciences. This has got to be really good. You know, this has to be like great, like what does, what, what do I, what do I do? Whenever I think about that, I understand that that's coming partly from an environment where there's lots of stereotypes. Just knowing that sort of helps me kind of take a little bit off in terms of anxiety, but it's something that I still work through everyday and it's something that I work with senior leaders to help eliminate that.

Speaker 1:          03:43          When you see underperformance. So in my field, it's how many articles are you writing a year, but in the corporate world it might be how many dollars are you bringing in or how many clients are you going to see or what your investment portfolio looks like. What I tell people is that underperformance is, doesn't mean that you can't do it. It might be something else that maybe there's something about the structure. So, but you must have the same at least kinds of experiences. I love to do. I think that perfectionism is gendered. Uh, yes. And, and if I were a person of color, I'd have it even worse because I think when you're the only, there's so much pressure on your shoulders and this is the problem with the demographics as we see them in many companies are particularly at the senior level when you are the only, there is just an undue amount of performance expectations.

Speaker 1:          04:33          It feels riskier because you're at that table like clinging to something that you've achieved and that you are the first. Yes. And so I think that it's double work, as you said earlier, and triple work to not only be proficient and excellent, but to be managing, am I safe here? Am I welcomed here, my valued here? Am I a token? Yes. You know, all of those things that go through our heads and so that's why I loved your comment about like who has supported you to help you believe not only do you belong here, but that you know you're, you're a star and there are many stars behind you. You know that you're actually paving the way for. I know in so much of my work with, with lower level employees or early in career seeing leaders like you who did make it, just that the, the power of being able to see yourself reflected in someone who's achieved and who is the first is.

Speaker 1:          05:30          So it is one of those things that I think leaders don't understand their role models every single day. Everything you do. Absolutely. And the fact that you rather a lot. You're your, uh, thank you. I appreciate that. Um, so I remember early on in my career, and this is something that when I worked with earlier, early career employees, I also talked to them about. I used to ask people for feedback constantly and I would go find the person who I knew was going to be the most critical and I would say tell me about my work even though I was really fearful. So fast forward, I've done research over the past 15 years showing that people with some kind of outsider status are less likely to receive informal feedback. So everyone received formal feedback, which is, you know, at the end of the year or you're mid career, your mid year review, but the watercooler feedback, which is I really matters what really matters.

Speaker 1:          06:29          Like, Hey, I think that you should be doing this, or hey, have you thought about this or hey, this new something or other came out and you should do this or hey, you probably didn't pull it together the way you should have, but you know, come back the next day. That informal feedback is really what sort of pushes people in one and when one direction or another. And so there, there are all of these subtle. So the way I always think about it is what is the structure of the company that either gives rise or facilitate stereotypes and really unconscious ways, or what is the company doing to mitigate those stereotypes. And that is all at a very unconscious level.

Speaker 2:          07:09          Mm.
