Speaker 1:          00:10          I, I was so young when I was in New York, I certainly wrote a lot,

Speaker 2:          00:17          but last time I was here I found it really distracting. I was hard to stay indoors because I wanted to be out all the time.

Speaker 1:          00:24          Um, I think the most important thing is to just get a ritual down wherever you are. Process.

Speaker 2:          00:38          Well there's two parts to it. There's the long term process of a novel and then there's the daily stuff, you know, it's like planning for a marathon. You, a, you set up your training schedule, you know, you have your idea. And I, I plotted out, I have to make a huge outline of it and about. And then I work every day about nine to two or three. I have to get three pages down everyday and there's usually a point about 150 pages in where everything falls apart. We're, all the plans are for not. The book has become something else and I have a nervous breakdown and then I submit to what the book has become and I keep going

Speaker 1:          01:21          and that's a terrible. And then a great time. No one likes to be around me during that to tell people. I mean, I really think it's just

Speaker 2:          01:36          what everyone says. It's a. it's willpower kind of a game that there's. Because the weirdest part in graduate school was that the most talented writers, we're not the ones who became writers. It was the dog had once and that. That's actually talent too I guess is just being willing to go every day and stay there until the pages appear every day and not. I tell this to my students too. I'm like, I know you can write a short story overnight, but that's not the job. That's not a longterm skill.

Speaker 1:          02:06          You need to write a short story over a month, every month and I think that's it. I don't think it's the right decision for everyone. You know? It was, I was coming from New York,

Speaker 2:          02:21          I couldn't afford anything. I was having a hard time figuring out how to be a writer here and I'm going to. Montana was a very attractive, completely different plan and it worked out great for me, but I'm not sure it helped my writing, you know, because you have a committee of people who are also lung young like you and don't really know how to do it well either, so it's a funny committee to be submitting your work too and you have to really know the confident in what you're doing because I wasn't writing like anyone else there and that was hard for me to figure out and I think it would be. And it's destructive to a novel for sure because you meet every week with part of a novel that really what you should

Speaker 1:          03:05          tell you a novelist is keep going until you finished the draft. Don't trust anyone in Montana. Yeah, it was, it was great. But

Speaker 2:          03:20          then also it was pretty cold, dark winters. I guess that helps novel writing to historically, but it also helps drinking, you know, at those times. But maybe that helps a novel too. But I love it. I go, I go every year. You know, I stay for a long time. I love going to writers colonies and pastoral settings where there's nothing to do, but

Speaker 1:          03:41          either walk around or read a book or work on your book and they all seem helpful in felonies.

Speaker 2:          03:54          I'm going there and then a month. Yeah, I can't wait. You work all day and produce so much work and it doesn't feel like work. It just feels like it feels like when you start out writing and you just want to write all the time and you're just so excited about everything you're doing. It feels like that. Again, it's hard to recreate because a lot of time it feels like a job.

Speaker 3:          04:15          It's like you're building something really huge.
