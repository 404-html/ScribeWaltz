Speaker 1:          00:09          Dave chappelle. Dave's my God brother. So I'm a bit biased and we came of age together in New York City, being in college and him at the Boston Comedy Club, which is a college of sorts for him. Um, I was actually known to some as Dave's Puerto Rican bodyguard because, uh, they didn't, they didn't know exactly what to make of, of the, of the guy who didn't smile much and just sat in the back of the club club reading books. Uh, they didn't realize that that was at Columbia University. And the only way I can have the privilege hanging out the comedy club as if I actually read books while somebody else was telling jokes. So say, yeah, Dave. Dave's definitely my favorite comic.

Speaker 2:          00:52          Okay.
