Speaker 1:          00:00          The New York Police Department over the last 12 years has made extraordinary progress in reducing crime in New York. Started 20 slash 25 years ago. I'm an idea that a called compstat, which was the idea that, um, turn all the data that we have about crime transparent, let us see in infinite detail where it's happening, who's doing it, um, gives us the opportunity to then manage a crime control very precisely and very and very effectively and move our resources where crime was and in fact bring it down in extraordinary ways. But what we also saw was that over these last 12 years, the move to crime control costs than New York police department, citizen support. It costs the New York Police Department, um, uh, the support of citizens for an incredibly important mission, which was crime control. We know that it's possible to have a great crime control and strong citizens support and we know that it's possible as well to truly engage police officers in that work.

Speaker 1:          01:13          When you have those three things moving together and when you keep your eye not only on citizens support and workforce engagement and crime control, but finally then on outcomes for neighborhoods, um, and we see we measure our success by whether people are playing in parks where their kids can walk to school safely, then we'll have a success in a way that we've never had before. We've lost, um, a, a large segment of New Yorkers, um, we know that we can get them back and we need to and we need to, in order to do that, um, will be successful with crime control when we are able to mobilize all segments of New York and support of it. If we can't, then we're not going to have the information that we need. We're not going to have the support that we need. We're, today's witness will, uh, won't come forward tomorrow if they don't see the results.

Speaker 1:          02:08          Uh, so they, we're in a new world today where, um, some of the traditional tools of law enforcement have been taken away from the New York Police Department by the courts. Um, stop and Frisk. We see the effect on the street corners and public housing. Trespass laws have been a very effective tool for law enforcement because we don't need to ask permission. We are the, we are the, the agents of the public housing. We can, uh, we use trespass, summonses for that kind of control. Even marijuana stops have been a way of control. Um, those three important control tools are now changing for the New York Police Department and we have to find new ways to assure safety and security for citizens to do that we will need to engage and to do that, we will need to understand far better than we do the sources of citizens support and to see far better than we ever have before.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Crime as it as it, as it begins to emerge. We know now that some of the hardest press a precincts and boroughs of New York, that cruise small groups of kids, teenagers have come together. One hundreds of crews that are responsible for a great deal of the gun violence in New York by hearing them speak, watching them speak. I'm looking at them on social media. We understand who is doing a lot of the, uh, who's causing a lot of the damage in the city and we've been able to address that not by hammering entire communities but by precision targeting, uh, these young people, not all of whom were bad boys and bad girls. A lot of them are good kids. I'm just getting mixed up with bad stuff. Um, and instead of hammering whole communities begin to work very surgically, that's the future of policing in New York in its future.

Speaker 1:          04:14          That's data driven, um, that looks for the supportive communities by, uh, by building up, um, uh, our contact and our engagement by social media, by using social media also to understand the ebb and flow of crime and disorder and communities using it appropriately and safely. Um, this is the new wave of policing in New York is the next generation where we measure our success now simply by Compstat, crime control numbers, but by crime control, plus citizen support, plus workforce engagement plus neighborhood outcomes. And we're now able to measure all of those in ways that we never have before. And we planned to so that we, as we achieve crime control, we lift support and we lived in a workforce engagement and we achieve great results for neighborhoods. That's really our goal. And I think what we can do next.
