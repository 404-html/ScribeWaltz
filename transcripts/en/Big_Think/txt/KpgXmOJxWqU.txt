Speaker 1:          00:06          No, it's very fun. It's like terminator, Terminator. No, I just liked the scan things and then something or wonder woman in a bionic woman. But, but something attracts the attention and I zero in. And it's funny because it can be millions of objects and uh, um, so at that point it's almost irrational. What attracts me about that object? But usually there's something, you know, I go in and dig deeper. Um, so it's not a first impression. It's not superficial. It's almost as if the work communication. Sorry if I sound a little new agey here at animistic, but it really works that way. And uh, what I do, I spend my day without thinking scanning things and uh, I, I already noticed your shirt and I already noticed, you know, I already noticed everything about you without even thinking it could be a good detective perhaps, you know, um, and uh, uh, and what attracts me in an object is some sort of communication that the designer already instilled in the object.

Speaker 1:          01:05          Because you know, what, if you notice today, the objects that are considered most interesting are the ones that are in doubt by the designer with some sort of a, how can I say, some sort of grabbing a element that attracts more than your attention, you know, that attracts really your interest. And this happens with all sorts of objects. That's why, you know, I was doing an interview once, I was interviewing Johnny Ive, who's the head designer for apple. He hardly ever gives interviews and I was really lucky that, you know, we're friends, but you know, I convinced him to give an interview, but we started talking about this, about the communication, um, that objects have with people. Because to me one of the most stunning features of apple computers is the little breathing light. You know, the little breathing light that tells you that the computer is leaping, is asleep and not turned off. I mean, that's amazing. It makes you think that the computer has a heart, you know? So it's this little touches that people noticed subliminally that differentiate certain objects from others.
