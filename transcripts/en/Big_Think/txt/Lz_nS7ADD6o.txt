Speaker 1:          00:06          Very common. Sorry, I'm a professor of psychology at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey. Well, it was an interesting research study by events and Wagner that was done in 1975. It was a long time ago, but it was a very interesting study where they, they asked men and women to describe their orgasms, uh, in writing. And then they, they remove all the specific references to the genitals. So you couldn't tell whether it was, uh, a man or a woman. These were college students, uh, describing their orgasms. And then they, they, uh, gave the, the descriptions. Each one was about a short paragraph of the description of, of the orgasm they gave. They gave the descriptions too. Um, uh, sex therapists and, and, um, uh, various experts in sexuality and mds and, and, uh, uh, asking, can you tell which one is written by a, uh, a male on which is written by a female? And the upshot of the experiment was that they couldn't tell the difference. They couldn't identify accurately whether the description of the orgasm was made by a man or a woman. Uh, so on that basis, my conclusion and their conclusion is that, uh, the, the feelings of orgasm when you remove the specific reference to the genitals, which would difference between the genitals and the sexist, uh, that the feelings of the organism are indistinguishable from each other for between men and women.

Speaker 1:          01:51          Well, we don't really know why some women can't experience orgasms. Um, actually, uh, that was, uh, I started out by, uh, uh, some years ago, uh, trying to find women who don't experience Orgasms, uh, to study them in looking at their brain activity during genital self stimulation. And we identified one woman and she, uh, but just before she came to our lab, she said she got a new boyfriend and now she's had her orgasm first orgasm. So that, uh, that, that did it for that experiment. So, uh, we're still looking and it is a very interesting question. We don't, we don't really know. I mean, certainly there are, there are situations in which, um, with a peripheral nerve damage or diabetes, these can impede the neural transmission descent, the, the, the sensory nerves as much more rare. In the, in the case of men, um, Kinsey, uh, reported that only, uh, uh, a few, uh, two or three of the men that they interviewed out of many hundreds, uh, could have orgasms by thought.

Speaker 1:          02:59          But, uh, we have found a substantial number of women who can have orgasms just by thinking and, uh, we've studied them and we're continuing to study them. It's really very interesting. Uh, the, the, uh, we have, we measured their heart rate and blood pressure and pain thresholds, which is a pain thresholds go up during orgasm. In other words, women, we found that women become much less sensitive to pain during orgasm and also the pupils dilate and all those measures, the heart rate, blood pressure, pain thresholds and pupil dilation, they all about doubled during orgasm, generated by, uh, uh, genital self stimulation. What we've found is that women, we had 10 women in the laboratory who said that they could have orgasms just by thought. And we measured their physiological responses when they applied a genital self stimulation, actual physical stimulation. And then we compared it with when they said that they had orgasms by thought alone, and the physiological responses were essentially the same.

Speaker 1:          04:07          There were, there were indistinguishable. In other words, they, those women were really having orgasms just by thinking. And, um, there were, they had different ideas. We asked them what, what they, uh, what their thought process is to elicit the orgasm. And some said that they had erotic imagery, but others said that they had, um, uh, pastor al imagery, like walking along the shore on a, on a warm summer day. Um, other women had a much more abstract image such as, uh, uh, imagining the, uh, energy, uh, moving up and down their bodies. The shocker is moving up and down the bodies, um, and, and producing the orgasm. So, uh, they're a big individual differences. And now we're looking at their brain activity in a women who, uh, have orgasms by thought alone. And we're seeing very, a great similarities between when they have orgasms by just thinking and orgasms when they, uh, do, uh, genital self stimulation.

Speaker 1:          05:17          We're starting to study men and, uh, it's a very good question, but we don't really know what, uh, what the differences, it seems to be much more rare in men than in women. Uh, one, one of the things that, um, uh, we'd be, we'll be looking for is, uh, one of the things we're finding a really very new findings is that when, uh, when women think of different parts of their body, uh, the, the, uh, thinking about those parts of the body activates the, the sensory cortex. Uh, there's a, there's a map of the body on the sensory cortex. In other words, is the, the fingers are in one place and the toes are represented in another place. The face is represented in another place, the genitals in another place. Um, and it's all systematically laid out very much like the body. The body plan is laid out on the, on the sensory cortex.

Speaker 1:          06:15          And what we're finding is that when women think about their finger being stimulated, or they think, think about their toe being stimulated, or they think about their, their, uh, uh, clutter is being stimulated or the nipple that, uh, the, the corresponding part of the body, uh, in the, the, the representation of, in the sensory cortex of those body parts is actually activated just as if they're really being stimulated physically. Uh, so I think one of the interesting questions is whether since women can think their genital, uh, systems into actual physical, into actual activity in the brain, can men do the same thing? If they can't, then that might be a way of understanding why women can have orgasms by thought alone. Are they activating their genital sis, their genital sensory representation, which then spreads to other parts of the brain and can mend, not do that or we don't really know, but we have the tools to investigate that.

Speaker 1:          07:23          That's an interesting, interesting that you asked that question because we're really dealing with that right now. Uh, because we have a, a, um, we want to see, since we know that if you think about your, think about the clearest. So think about the, uh, the g spot. We'll think about the cervix that those, that the, the corresponding part of the bottom of the brain map for those parts of the body, those become activated. So, uh, one question is whether a women who can think themselves to orgasm, do they think their genital activation, the brain, a representation of the Genitalia into act, into activity, and does that spread to the other systems that are involved in orgasm? How do they do it? We want to understand how they do it normally. And then the question is, what if we, uh, ask women to think about the Janet the genitals, um, more intensively or will we, will we, will they be able to intensify the response in their genital sensory cortex?

Speaker 1:          08:31          And will that spread to other parts of the brain? Will that facilitate their orgasm? I'd be, I think it could be very useful in, in women who say that they don't experience orgasms. It could be a useful in women with spinal cord injury who can't feel their, their external genitals. Can they, can they think their a brain greater activation and will that facilitate their orgasm? That's a, it's a, um, it's a question that we are currently dealing with it without a brain research and it's a, it's a very important and interesting question and it could be therapeutic for therapeutically useful. One of the techniques that we're, that we've developed is to have the women in the scanner, uh, looking at their own brain activity in near real time. Uh, and the question is if we can see our own brain activity in near real time in specific regions, can we voluntarily increase the activity of that part of the brain?

Speaker 1:          09:35          Just by thinking about it? Uh, just as um, as we can think about moving our finger and we can, we can move our finger. We can wiggle a finger. We don't know what we do. Uh, we, we learned to do it as an infant cause we got the feedback between what we see and what we, what we do. Maybe we can do the same thing with the brain. If we see our own brain activity, uh, maybe we can make a change and maybe that's going to change the way we feel or the way we move. Uh, so this is a, uh, a new technology of near real time brain imaging and, uh, with, uh, unlimited, uh, frontiers. We don't really know how, uh, how far we can go with that, but it's a, it's a new, it's a new approach.
