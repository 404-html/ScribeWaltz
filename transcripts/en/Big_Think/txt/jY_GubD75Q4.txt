Speaker 1:          00:07          Is a conventional wisdom kind of idea?

Speaker 2:          00:12          This is like the greatest period of technological change in history and certainly by some measures, there have been immense changes that are hard to imagine.

Speaker 3:          00:27          Uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:28          having been matched in the past, as we said earlier in this interview, I don't know that there's been a period of time when people have so rapidly gained access to so much information. But there've been other big eras where technology change very fast to beginning of the last century when the automobile, the airplane, the Telegraph, all these things came along very quickly. The telephone,

Speaker 3:          00:52          uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:54          even further back in history, various developments in medicine and sanitation and other things that really had huge outcomes in the way people lived and worked. And what gets me up every morning is that I, I am living in one of those periods. Even if it's not, it doesn't matter to me that it's the biggest or the fastest or whatever. It's one of those periods of amazing technological change. I, I work for a publication that is respected and that has resources for me to cover these changes. And I get to, uh, see a lot of these things, not only early but in the context of how they were developed. The developers come, uh, they want me to write about it. And so we have a conversation about why didn't you do this? How did you come to doing this? What was your idea? They love talking about it.

Speaker 2:          01:45          I love listening to it. It also gives me a chance to meet a important I people I think are important historical figures the way that I used to when I covered. And I used to go to the White House sites to go to the Kremlin. I used to go to all these places, 10 Downing Street, these various places. Uh, now I go to Google, I go to Microsoft, I go to apple. I, uh, have spent many hours of conversation over the years, uh, with people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and the guys who founded Google and uh, Steve case who founded AOL and numerous other people. And so, um, I've learned a lot from that and I feel like it must have been, like, it would've been like if you had sort of modern journalism covering Henry Ford or Thomas Edison or whatever. So that gets me up in the morning. It's fascinating.
