Speaker 1:          00:09          Uh, uh, of the changes since nine 11 have been positive. I mean an enormous amount of money has been thrown at the intelligence community. So you, you went from a period in the 90s where, uh, the peace dividend after the cold war was in many cases taken at the expense of the intelligence community and there wasn't much hiring going on and a lot of early retirements are being forced and there weren't very many investments and place, it really kind of hollowed out after nine 11, massive amounts of money were thrown in. Everybody went on huge hiring sprees and what you, I mean, I don't live inside the community but touring it and bumping up against it. What I, my impression is that immediately after nine 11, you had an extraordinarily talented group of young people volunteer to go into the intelligence beauty, probably the best generation of public servants and went into the government.

Speaker 1:          01:02          You know, since the 60s, people were motivated. They were smart, they were well educated and they were committed, uh, after nine, 11, and then they, but they went into the system. The system really didn't know how to absorb them. And a lot of them bounced out. A lot of people became disillusioned. There weren't a good senior programs or officers available to mentor them. And so I think that sort of wave of young people as has been atrophied and maybe not, um, sort of, um, brought up to the way, the way you would win in the meanwhile, one of their experiences when all these really great people went in was that the whole system kept being reorganized and then reorganized again. And then the agencies, we're all moving around. And so I think the sense you have from inside is that there's still a lot of confusion about what is a career in intelligence. I mean, how do you actually have a useful and successful and interesting career as a, as an operative. I mean, analysts, you know, there's millions of analysts running around. Um, but as to the actual collection of intelligence, which was what the problem seemed to be running up to nine 11, I don't think the system is, is, I don't think the system is fixed at all. I think it's still a mess.

Speaker 2:          02:25          Yes. Sorry. For

Speaker 1:          02:26          private firms, I think that's a, I think that's plain. I think it's, um, I don't think that private contractors ought to be acting on the battlefield as sort of proxies for or allies of the u s military. Um, I think private contracting for logistics and for support and for technology, um, and maybe for some analysis, uh, can be part of a governmental system, but to have private contractors in the field tearing out the, the sort of state craft of war or shadowy intelligence, a warlike activity, paramilitary or collection activity, I think is a mistake.

Speaker 2:          03:16          Pardon?

Speaker 1:          03:17          You know, he's a, he's a professional who I think was welcomed there when he was appointed because the turmoil of the previous regime had been pretty considerable. He was a known quantity. He was known to be sort of a friend of the CIA, wasn't there to tear it down or kind of reinvent it the way some other directors had, had come in wanting to do. But the basic problem that he faces and that the agency faces is that they basically had been reorganized out of their prestige and to some extent reorganized out of their parts of their mission. And you know, they've lost their place at the table. Their place at the table with the White House is now taken by the director of national intelligence, the new sort of tsar of all the intelligence agencies. And that means the CIA is adjusting to a completely different world in which it does.

Speaker 1:          04:09          No, it no longer has direct contact with the press of the United States every morning. That's what made the CIA the source of all this mystique in our political culture was that, you know, every morning, first thing, six 30 or 7:00 AM the president nodded, states sits down with the director of the CIA or his designated briefer and they talk about the world. And when the president wants something done off the books, uh, he turns to the CIA and he says directly, you know, I want to, I want to raid Cuba or I want to foment a descent in this country or that, and that relationship of the president and the CIO is broken. It just doesn't exist anymore. The CIA has now more like the FBI at works at one step removed. It has a mission to go out into the world and steal secrets and occasionally go out in the world and blow up bridges. But it's doing that almost as a kind of separate like, uh, like, like the Federal Reserve that does monetary policy that they're divorced from, from policy and decision making or if there's an intermediary and the DA and Dni. And I think Hayden has not been able to quite resolve how this reorganization will play out in the, in the life of the institution.

Speaker 2:          05:23          Well, there's a very heated debate yeah.

Speaker 1:          05:25          Within the U s army and the military continuing now, and I'm still, I'm doing some work on this now. Um, and you know, the, the strain, everyone agrees there was an enormous strain. Uh, the question is, uh, that are, the questions that are debated are what are the strategic consequences of this strain. Um, and on the one hand you have those like Casey or a certain colonels and others who would emphasize the loss of combat capability, uh, the potential for a surprise elsewhere in the world that the United States can't respond to. Um, and, and the general sort of inability of the United States to say pivot from Iraq where things may be going better to Afghanistan, where things are clearly going worse because there just is no, there's no elasticity in the, in the system anymore. The resources are all on the, in the field. So that's one side.

Speaker 1:          06:31          The other side emphasizes as gates did and a speech a couple of weeks ago, look, we have armies to win the wars that we're in. And you know, I would rather break an army winning, uh, the war that we have to win than worry about some future scenario. Nobody this. So somebody was arguing with her the other day. I says, you know, nobody worried during World War II that we were going to break the army and overemphasize figuring out how to beat Nazi Germany. And then we were going to miss Vietnam because we hadn't prepared for counterinsurgency. No, you, that's what you have armies for is to go all out to achieve the objectives you need to achieve now. So then that depends on whether you believe finishing in Iraq with every, uh, brigade available is really in the national interest. Uh, and that, and so in the end, these arguments about strain and breaking the army, uh, there are kind of coded argument about whether the rock is still worthwhile.

Speaker 2:          07:34          I think the hud still important for a lot of them

Speaker 1:          07:35          reasons. Uh, you know, starting with justice, the fact that he's, you know, at large and, and has more or less accepted responsibility for the attacks and no one's ever bothered to chase him down. Um, but more sort of relevant to the current scene. This, we talked before about the 20 years of continuous leadership, the ability to deliver messages to followers, to define the narrative of the war that he believes he's leading to identify targets to name countries, but he's still matters. It doesn't matter the way he did in 1999, but taking him off the airwaves and forcing al-Qaida to deal for the first time in 20 years with a succession crisis, probably from the point of view of alcaide his adversaries would be a good objective. Um, so I think there are lots of reasons why the, the hunt for him still matters as to what al Qaeda is capability is, uh, this year.

Speaker 1:          08:26          Um, I think all you can really do is look at what the system is reporting by way of kind of threat reporting on the one hand, and then what all the open source evidence from the last three or four years tells you about their capability. And I think that in summary, what it tells you is that they still have the intent to carry out what you might think of as sort of medium sized, uh, attacks against airplanes, uh, against, uh, subway systems against embassies, military bases. They have the capability to plan sort of six to nine month, fairly complicated, fairly ambitious plans like the one that's on trial in London involving the attempt to blow up planes over the Atlantic in August of 2006, the one that led to us not being able to carry our toothpaste board airplanes, that was their most ambitious plots since nine 11.

Speaker 1:          09:19          It was meant to be the fifth anniversary plot. It was meant to take down five to 10 planes. If it's exceeded, you'd have, we'd be living in a different world. There'd be 600 or more dead Americans and Brits lying in the Atlantic Ocean and we'd probably be occupying the federally administered tribal areas and in engaged in a very vicious, a counter insurgency campaign. But that's been their most ambitious plot since. And it's, it's a couple of orders of magnitude short of nine 11. So I think they'll probably, I mean, bin Ladin keeps an eye. Al Kind keeps an eye on the calendar. They know this is an election season. I think he'll probably want to do something in 2004 what we can see in retrospect is that he didn't have the capability to do anything other than a media event, but he appeared like an apparition on the weekend before the election and delivered this message to the American people. John Kerry's still believes that this day was a factor in his defeat in a close election. So at a minimum, I expect them to attempt media events, but if they have capability of, they'll probably will use it during the fall season. Yeah.
