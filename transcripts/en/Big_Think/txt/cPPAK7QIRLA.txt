Speaker 1:          00:06          There's a trajectory in the shows that have done at Moma up in there, it's almost 14 years and it's a trajectory that is personal, but that it's at the same time as institutional, you know, from the beginning. Moma has alternated in design very historical exhibitions that are meant to advance the scholarly field with exhibitions that are instead and programs that are instead about people's lives, about how design can improve people's lives, about, uh, issues that pertain to that particular moment. Just to give you an example, you know, Moma had a series in the 19 thirties that was called good called good design under $5, $10, blah, blah blah during the war because you, because people had no access to steel and aluminum and other materials. They did a show called good design in times of war. So it was always with an attention to people's needs in my particular, um, um, career.

Speaker 1:          01:00          I tried always to look at both people's lives and also technology advancements in always this to this two spheres coming together. So the first show that I did in 95 was called Newton materials and contemporary design. It was about a revolution in the way materials were designed and implemented, something that gave designers more power to actually find to not only the objects but also the materials, so it was technology and it was life and then I went on and did other shows. Sorry, can you cut in between? Okay. And then I went on and did other shows that were about people's lives. Just to give you an example, in 2000 I did a show called work spheres because@thattimeitwasthe.com boom. It was the beginning of wireless technology, so there was a lot of excitement. We all went, almost were all drunk, right? With this kind of possibilities, but at the same time wireless technology was not really working.

Speaker 1:          01:56          We were always traveling with too many plugs and then the plug didn't work. The server at home did not connect. We had to dial in. I mean it was just hell. So it was about wireless technology, new possibilities and people's real lives. So it was all this new concepts for working and traveling and so on and so forth. And about two years ago I did a show on design and safety because safety has become a really big concern, you know, the world has changed. I don't need to explain, it was something that was conceived before nine slash 11, but, and it was topped by 9:11 because I freaked out at that time and waited for a long time. So it was only two years ago, but it was about design and safety. Now I've come to the point that wireless technology really works, that we really are in communication with many different parts of the world. We work at different scales, we work in different time zones on screens, have different resolutions. We speak with people from all over the world. We are sometimes alone and sometimes in the middle of the gigantic route we've become much more elastic. And uh, um, it's an about these possibilities, new technologies and the connection between design and science. So it really is about us negotiating all these changes and negotiating progress with the help of design.
