Speaker 1:          00:03          It was, it was an incredible, except it's a great experience actually. Um, um, I, I sort of wandered into this, into this business. I'm inadvertently, I was in the book publishing business and, um, I started to publish books about technology and about the Internet so that I, I was, I, I suppose I'm earlier than most, um, through this product that really had nothing to do with the internet or technology. Nevertheless, being about those subjects introduced me to this, to this business. And in New York I became sort of very early, one of the few people who had any claim on knowing anything about this business, although I'd like to footnote that I really knew nothing at all. And um, uh, but as this business started to, to um, uh, to heat up anybody who had any claim on it was suddenly at the um, um, at center stage.

Speaker 1:          01:09          And, um, it was a opportunity knocking venture capital came my way and I began to build a company again having no idea, um, um, um, what kind of company I was building or really any idea about the business in which I was building this, this, um, this company. So this was truly learning on the job. Um, and, um, I, I can only say in my defense that virtually everybody who, who was starting Internet businesses at that point in time was also learning on the job. Um, and, um, I, and I, I learned I'm not enough, but, um, nobody in those days learned enough and, um, everyone, virtually everyone went under and I went under as well. Um, um, I was in the fortunate position to be able to, um, um, to tell the story and I wrote a book called burn rate and, um, um, and that, which I still think as serves as one of the great cautionary tales of, of the period. But, um, um, I, I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Speaker 1:          02:31          I took certain steps when I, when I started newser to ensure that, um, um, that, that, that I, I had gotten somewhat older and I didn't think that I wouldn't necessarily be able to, my, my system would be able to, uh, to tolerate the highs and lows of, of the first experience in, in the Internet. So I went into newser with um, um, with a few safety measures. Um, my partner, um, in nooser is someone who absolutely knows what he's doing, who has, um, uh, started two successful companies. I'm on the Internet. He founded hoovers.com, hadn't took that public and then sold it, Dun and Bradstreet, and he started high beam, which I'm an another news database company which he sold. So I feel in a remarkably good hands, um, the, the editor and chief of news there is also, um, um, Caroline Miller, who was the editor and chief of the New York magazine, credibly, um, um, professional and, and tenacious and accomplished woman. So in reality, I'm at news or I do very little.
