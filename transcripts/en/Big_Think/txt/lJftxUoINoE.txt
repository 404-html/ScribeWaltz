Speaker 1:          00:00          So my name is Dan Arielli and I'm the James B Duke professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. So I became interested in online dating because one of the people who were sitting in an office next to me was incredibly miserable and he was an assistant professor. He just moved to the university where I was at a. He was spending long hours. He was not finding anybody to date. He was couldn't date students at the university who was a professor and he didn't have time to go outside, you know, we will not particularly social bunch, you know, he was, he was basically stuck and all I did it was a very promising way to think about this solution for a marketplace that wasn't working very well and he tried online dating and he was just failing miserably continuously. So that kind of piqued my curiosity about it.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And then I started looking at online dating. So I started looking by registering myself and looking at other people. And then I said, let, let me ask some of my friends to enroll because I didn't ask them to really enroll. They just took the profile sheets and they ask people, could you fill those out but without your name, and they took people that I liked more than I liked less and they took a profit and I tried to figure out who they tell the difference. You know, and imagine that you did this. Imagine you went to 50 people you really like and 50 people you only like so, so, and you asked all of them to feel this profit. Then you took this 100 profiles and you try to sort them into piles. It turns out we were terrible at this, right? So this is kind of an initial observation is that something is going wrong in this, in this market, and then went a step further, did some studies with online data is about how much they enjoyed it and what they were getting from it until the final stage we.

Speaker 1:          01:39          I figured out, I thought I knew what was going on, which is that online dating site assume that people are easy to describe on searchable attributes. They think that we're like digital cameras that you can describe somebody by their height and weight and political affiliation and so on, but it turns out people are much more like wine that when you taste the wine, you could describe it, but he's not a very useful description, but you know if you like it or don't, is the complexity and the completeness of the experience that tells you if you're like a person or not. And these breaking into attributes turns out not to be very informative. So in the last stage of this process, we created a different website and that different websites allow people to experience other people without all of these attributes and we show that this is actually much better and would lead to much more, much higher probability of going on a second on the real date afterwards.

Speaker 1:          02:30          So. So it kind of goes from an observation to a little study to a bit more details and finally proposing some kind of solution of something that I think would actually work better. So the site basically looks at real dates and think about what real dates are. They're not about sitting in a room and interviewing each other about question. They're often about experiencing. It's in something together in the real world and I think it's because if you and I went out and we went somewhere, I would look at how you react to the outside world, what music you like, what you don't like, what kind of pictures you like, what kind of images, how do you react to other people, what do you do in the restaurant and through all these kinds of non explicit aspects, I will learn something about, you know, I would feel that I'm learning something about you and the online system we created was very much like that.

Speaker 1:          03:17          It was about you came up when you got the little Avatar is square or triangle, some color and you wanting to a virtual space which you could explore it and you could see lots of stuff. There were pictures and images and there were words and there were movies and they were bands. There's all kinds of stuff and you could go and when you came to another little Avatar, you could start chatting and you would chat about something. It wasn't about interviewing when you went to school in what's your religion? It was about talking about something else and it turns out it gave people much more information about each other and they're much more likely to want to meet each other for the first eight and four for a second date.

Speaker 1:          03:57          So I think that online dating is an incredibly unsatisfying experience. In fact, when we do surveys to understand what people do, they the basic trade off is for each six hours of searching for people and emailing them and you get one cup of coffee and it's not as if people enjoy online dating. It's not as if they have fun searching people in a writing blogs for them. I mean imagine that you basically had to drive six hours, three hours each week to have coffee with somebody and you know, coffee usually ends up with just coffee. It's an incredibly unsatisfying experience. So I, I think it's a really bad. It's really bad system. On top of that, there's another thing is, which I imagine they gave you the search criteria which asks you to search by height and weight and income and all of those things.

Speaker 1:          04:43          You're going to use it. That's what I give you to search. You're going to use it. There's a million people out there. You want to limit them to $3,000. That's what we're going to. That's what you're going to use, and because of that, I think actually people become much more superficial than we think they're. So here's an example. It turns out that women really care about men's height. I'm five nine. If I wanted to be as attractive as somebody who's five, 10, right? Another inch, I would have to make about 35, $40,000 more a year. That's another money for one inch. At the same time, it turns out that men care a lot about women's BMS. In fact, they want women to be slightly on the rack sick. It's like 18 and a half and you look at women's attractiveness. It goes really up at low BMI and really drops below that.

Speaker 1:          05:28          Now people online look incredibly superficial, they look at hair color and they look at height and they look at income and that's basically it and attractiveness of course, and you can ask is it because that's all people care about or is that because that's what the system is giving them to search for and I think it's because of combination, right? Sure. We also prefer, sure we do care about attractiveness and in heightened income, and these are, these are features for us, but they think they're exaggerated by the way the system is creative. Imagine you were looking for something else. Imagine you were looking for eh digital cameras and imagine that I only allow you to search on mega pixels and the f stop for the Lens, right? These things will become incredibly important. Right? And if I drop some things from the search, they will become as if they're not important or much less important.

Speaker 1:          06:17          So I think part of the problem is that the systems don't give us the right information that we need and because of this, I think the experience of online dating is generally unsatisfying. I mean, think about it, how many millions of people are participating in this activity and a marriage rates has not increased. Divorce rate has decreased. I mean, not really much has happened because of the Atlantic. At the same time. I think it's incredibly important, right? We, the dating market is perhaps the only market that we moved from a centralized market to a decentralized markets. You know, we used to have a into your parents used to tell you what to do. All this is gone. Now you have to fend for yourself. On top of that, we move a lot, right? You, you go to one place for Undergrad, then you go to Grad school, then you move to another city for a job to easily remove.

Speaker 1:          07:07          Again, you have no time to create a social network. We work long hours, so it really assist them where we don't have time to find people for ourselves. It's very, it's taboo to date people at the workplace. Uh, the social networks are weaker in the physical world. We move all the time and we don't have a, our parents to tell us what to do. So, so online dating are incredibly important. They could be central and crucial and we need to create them because it's really a miserable situation for most single people at the same time. The ones that we have created and they all look the same. Basically, there are no real differences between them. The ones that we're creating, I just not that useful.

Speaker 1:          07:48          Assortative mating is the idea that if you took all men and you rank them on how attractive they are from the most attractive to the least attractive and you write it all women from the most attractive to the least attractive and you can think about attractiveness is built, being built from lots of stuff, right? It's not just beauty. It could be beauty and intelligence and so on, but if you created this, it was mostly about beauty, but you know, if you created that, it turns out that the most attractive would date, the most attractive, the middle attractive with basically the middle and the low data low. Now there could be slight deviations, but that's what happened and why? Because if you're at the top and you're a guy, you can pick anybody you want, so you would pick a woman who was on the top and if she's at the top she could pick anybody she wants you will pick you.

Speaker 1:          08:30          So another question is what happened to the people in the middle, you know, most of us, what, what happens to people in the middle, how do we make sense of where we are in the social hierarchy? And for me that thought actually became a very kind of crucial in the parents when I got injured. So here's what happened. You, you grow up and you have some kind of space in society and you know, basically where you are and you know, who date you and who would not take you, who's kind of outside of your league in general terms and you know, where you fit in the social hierarchy. And, and, and I knew I wasn't a social hierarchy, but one day I got badly injured and you know, I couldn't think about romantic stuff for a long time. But when I could, um, office and I started wondering about where do I fall now in the social hierarchy, I'll try to think about, do I fall in the same place?

Speaker 1:          09:17          I'm kind of the same person inside, but I look much less attractive. Right. And with the women who were dating before we keep on dating me now. And I said, why would they, they have other options, right? I'm not the only guy in the world. So, so it was kind of a very difficult concept for me to think about where do I fall? I felt differently on the social hierarchy. I basically lost my space all of the time and I was trying to understand how these social dance happened and how we find our place. And I was really wondering about where would I find my own mate, where, where would I fit in this in this scale? And there's a lot of personal complexities with it, but eventually it led me to a study in the study was really asking the question of how do we make sense of where we fit in the hierarchy and the basically kind of multiple explanations, right?

Speaker 1:          10:05          You could say you never adjust. You never. If you kind of in the middle range or the low range and you only are. You have to date somebody else who's in the middle range. You never make peace with it. You wake up every morning, you look at your partner across your shoulder and you say, well, that's the best I could. I really wanted more. Sadly, no. I have to admit my limitations. That's the most I could do. That means you don't adapt. It could be that you adapt. It could be that, for example, if you're unattractive, you start looking at other features that are unattractive and see them as attractive. You remember the story from cree love when you have this, this wolf city say grapes over the fence and he tries to get them and he can't get them and eventually said, ah, there was sour anyway, and he goes to eat something else.

Speaker 1:          10:53          Right? So you could imagine that if you are attractive yourself, you start valuing. If you're a woman, you start valuing short men who are bald with bad teeth, right? I mean you just say, these are really wonderful features. I like hairy chest. I like bullheaded. You basically change what you like and that actually helps you adjust. Or You can imagine that you start liking other things. You stop paying attention to attractiveness and start paying attention to other things. So we tried that in an experiment. Initially we went to this website called hot or not. It's a wonderful website. You see pictures of people and you decide you rank them on a scale from zero to 10 about how attractive they are and then you see how you rated this person, how other people rate them. But the nice feature about this website is that if I reach people, the website knows how I was rated as well because I have my picture there as well.

Speaker 1:          11:45          By the way, I'm not rated very high, I think like six point four. But there are people who are rating, you know how the rating and you know how the rated. So now the question is the people who are providing the rating, there are people who are really attractive, that are providing writing and people who are really unattractive, providing the rating. And the first thing you can ask is do they have different ratings? Are the people who are inherently unattractive? Do they see beauty differently? And the answer is no. We all see beauty in the same way. The people who are nine rate people the same way as the people who are for in the hotness rating. So, so people don't change their sense of beauty. Now you could say, uh, so maybe they don't adjust at all. Maybe they don't adapt the people who are for coupons looking for the people who are with nine or maybe they adapt some other way.

Speaker 1:          12:36          So hot the note has another feature which is the cycle of meet me in which you see pictures of people and you say, do I want to meet them or not? Now it's not just reading. It's about also thinking about the probability that you will be accepted or turn down and it's not so embarrassing to be turned online, but it's still a little bit embarrassing. So the question is that people who are nine, will they approach different people than the people who are for. And the answer is absolutely yes. The people who are for basically approached people who are four or five, the people who are nine approach people who are nine or 10 people are a little optimistic. They approach a little too high, but they basically know the rage. So what happened is people know the range, they know where they are in the social hierarchy, but the same time they see beauty at the same thing.

Speaker 1:          13:19          So what happens? So how people solve it, they wake up every morning feeling bad or do they solve it in some way? So the last step we did the speed dating events. We get people to do a speed dating event and we asked them to rate other people or lots of attributes, not just attractiveness, but all kinds of other things and what we saw was the people who are very attractive, cared more about attractiveness. This is like one of the dominating criteria. They want to date somebody who is attractive. While the people who are unattractive basically say we don't care so much about attractiveness. We want people who are kind and have a good sense of humor. So what happened is that the way people adapt the people at the low end of the scale is by changing your priorities and office and saying, I want people with different set of attributes I don't care so much about, but I want somebody who's client good hearted with a good sense of humor. And that's actually the story for the patients. So that's the story of how we are coming into a social hierarchy in a certain place and based on our circumstances come to understand differently what we want and don't want and how we view the world in a way that is compatible with where we are in the social hierarchy.

Speaker 1:          14:32          So I don't know if you've had the experience of going into a Kia, but uh, I, I go from time to time and the last thing I did was a builder, a toy chest for my, for my kids. And when I got home with this box actually set up boxes and they started assembling them. Uh, for me, the instructions were very unclear and I kept on screwing things and screwing them wrongly and had to disassemble it, put it back together. And so on. By the end of the day, I worked a lot. It was not a particularly beautiful piece of furniture, but I was actually quite attached to it. What did. I think that's kind of the interesting idea is that when you put a lot of yourself into it, some sweat and energy and anger, not even frustration, you end up loving the end product a bit more.

Speaker 1:          15:15          We tried to do this with experiments and we got people to build the Legos in and all kinds of things and the first thing we found was that if there was an origami that you build in Origami that somebody else built, you think that yours is much, much more beautiful. Not only is it more beautiful, you willing to pay much more for it. Right now. The question is why you could imagine I built an origami that is uniquely good for me and you the other origami is not so it's unique to me. It's not about the fact that I kind of wrongly evaluated. He just has some features that are particularly like. So we ask people to predict how other people would pay for it and it turns out people are really wrong with it. Not only do we like more the origami we make, we think other people would love them as well.

Speaker 1:          15:57          And you can think about kids like this, right? I have two wonderful kids. I love them dearly. I think they're amazing when we go to a party and they dance or do something. I can't believe that any of the parents would want to do anything but look at my kids. Right? And that's the issue right there. My kids, I think they're are wonderful, but not only that, I think that other people should see them as wonderful as I see them in the same thing happened with origami or with everything we make. Not only do we overvalue it, we think that everybody will share our, our perspective. And this of course creates both opportunities for better things and opportunities for mistakes. Right? So if you're, if you're a company and you can create things that people would actually put something of themselves into it and actually value it more, that's a great thing to do, right?

Speaker 1:          16:47          Uh, there's lots of opportunities for tailoring and custom made and use a design on the web. It's also about cooking for yourself and doing your own garden and fixing things yourself because we might not understand that if we do something ourselves, we would like it more, but the fact is we we likely would do the same thing, but of course there's the downside and the downside is if we create something, we ended up loving it, perhaps too much. We don't sit it in an objective way and as a consequence we can make mistakes as well. And that's actually a general comment about rationality and irrationality. Rationality and irrationality is not always bad. It's not always that the irrational person is better than irrational. It's a mixture, right? It's really wonderful that we can love our kids so much that that's why they actually get to live and we care about them, but at the same time, our blindness to them, to them or to the weaknesses can actually create some negative consequences as well.

Speaker 1:          17:47          So I think the world would actually be quite terrible if everybody would be, would be perfectly rational. And you know, when you ask people this question initially, you said, Oh yes, I want everybody to be irrational, but the fact is that I pick the title, the upside of irrationality, because I think there's a lot of wonderful things about your rationality. I'll give you two examples. The first one is imagine that you left your wallet on your desk and you went out for lunch. What are the odds that somebody will steal it right? And now think about what are the odds that somebody would steal it if everybody you worked with was perfectly rational. If everybody was constantly doing the cost benefit analysis, if that's all what people were doing, they would pass by your desk. They would say, hey, nobody's here. Nobody's looking. I can steal this and have no chance of being caught.

Speaker 1:          18:29          Let me do that. Right? In fact, if we lived in a society where everybody was just maximizing their own self interest all the time, it will be quite a terrible place to live. Here's another example. Imagine a game we call the trust game and then I'll tell you about the trust game. We'd revenge. So imagine two players, player a and player B, and the trust game looks like this. We tell player a player, you have $20, you could do two things, you can either go home or you can give your money to player b and you don't know who play B is and you'll ever meet them. If you send your money to play or a B player b will get $80, the money will quadruple magically underway. And now play a beat who decide to do two things? They could go home with $80, in which case you will get nothing or they could send you back half the money.

Speaker 1:          19:13          Now think about this situation. Imagine you player a and you ask yourself what would play or be do if player b was perfectly rational, what would they do? They will go home with all the money, right? They will maximize the self interest. Why would they give you back any money? So if you thought that player b was perfectly rational, would you send them the money? Of course not, right? So the rational prediction is that player b will never send the money back, and because of that, player a will never trust him to start with. Turns out people are much nicer than economic theory predicts. There's a good chance that player a, we'll send them money and a good chess player. B, we'll send half the money back. And if you were a player b, you can just imagine. Imagine you just got in the mail.

Speaker 1:          19:51          Somebody that says, Hey, here's what happened. Would you send the money back or not? Right? Most people would do it. So people, this is the case when people are national economic theory, but imagine your player a and you send them money to player B and player b took the money and left and now I come to you and I say, really? Salary player a, you lost all your money. But I tell you what, if you go into a checking account and you get more money out and you give it to me for every dollar you give me, I will go. I will hunt, play a beat down and I'll take $2 away from them. You give me $2, a 109, take four, you gave me 10 $100 and take from them and the question is would you lose more of your own money to exert revenge on them?

Speaker 1:          20:36          You just lost $20 and you can lose even more to exact revenge on them. And everybody who had a divorce or breakup know the answer right? When we feel betrayed, we would spend lots and lots of money to inflict even more pain on the other side. And when Ernst Fair in some of his friends did it work like this, they basically put people in an imaging so they could image people's brains while they were executing and plotting revenge and what they saw was that the activity of revenge was rewarding. It was pleasurable. Now again, it's irrational. Why would it be rewarding and pleasurable? Think about it this way. Imagine that you and I were living on a desert island and imagined I had the mango and you wanted my mango and imagine I kind of looked. I was away for a minute and you could still my mango if you thought that the only thing I was doing is a cost benefit analysis.

Speaker 1:          21:29          You would say, Hey, if I steal Dan's mango and run far away enough, he will do the cost benefit analysis. You will decide not to chase me, not to find out what happened. He'll just go and get the new mango and under those circumstances a good chance you'll take my mango away, but what if I was a revengeful type? What if you knew that if you stole my mango, I will not sleep and I will not rest. I will hunt you down. It doesn't matter how long it will take me and how far I have to run and how many nights I will not sleep. I will hunt you down. I'll take my mango and all your bananas in your goat and your whatever, whatever it is under that condition, you will probably not start with me to start with. Right? You will not take anything with me.

Speaker 1:          22:07          So the way to understand it is that trusting is irrational, but we do it. Revenge is irrational, but we do it and we do it because trust and revenge are actually two sides of the same coin. Trust is incredibly important for society. Imagine how we would live in a society without trust, but to have trust, we also have to have revenge and those things together make sense. They're both irrational, but they're both make sense and they actually help us to live in a better society. So would I prefer a society when everybody's rational? I don't think so. Not In a. not in a long shot.

Speaker 1:          22:49          One of the things that I think companies do to a large degree that makes very little sense is the use of focus groups. So think about what a strange idea is that we take 10 people who know basically nothing about your project and you put them in a room and you let them talk for awhile and then you take the whatever they came up with as a consequence of these two hours of random thinking and you base your strategy on it to a large degree. And, and I don't want to say that focus groups are always useless and also uninformative, but I think that taking this data and then realizing it as extensively as companies do, I think, I think it's crazy in many ways. And the reason I think companies do it is because when these people create a sentence or an idea, it's very easy to say, joe focus group 17 said this and it can help you create a form, formulate an idea around it.

Speaker 1:          23:43          When if you said 87 percent of the people said x, he just doesn't have a face, he doesn't have a desire, it's just not as concrete and therefore people are not as excited about the, about the notion. So I think the focus group is incredibly useful as a persuasive attempt, uh, to, to tell people what to do, but as a way to find out information, it's not as useful as people think it is. The other thing that really puzzles me is that the companies, how little they understand about how incentives really work. So the, the biggest expenditure for almost any company is salaries. And you ask people, what do you know about the relationship between salaries and performance? The answer is nothing. Right? And the question is why don't they study anything? Why don't they studied? Why don't they try different performance, different incentive level and see how it influenced a performance.

Speaker 1:          24:36          And they often say, well the law kind of laws and if we have pay some people one way and another way we might be sued. And, but in the last two years with all these questions about bonuses and so on, I've gone to many companies and said, why don't we at least do some surveys? Why don't we at least see how happy people are on the months where they give them, you give them their bonus and how productive they are. And the answer I got 100 percent of the time is that people are really miserable in both the season. And because of that they don't want to ask them any more questions. And I said, if people are miserable in bonuses and shouldn't it mean that you should study it, understand it and try to prevent it from next for next year. And say, well, well not this year, this year was really miserable.

Speaker 1:          25:18          Maybe next year come back to us next year. But if you think about it, it's really incredible. Now how do companies decide about compensation? They look at what other companies are doing and try to equate compensation to what other companies are doing it, but it's a place of the blind leading the blind. Right? And then if we pay five percent more, other people will start doing it, but the real question is how do you pay in? How do you get people to care about their work and become more productive and be happier at their work? And the answer is not simply that more money is better, more money can be part of the equation, but it's also the question of how do you give that money? You give it a bonus to give this a fixed salary. You give it as a part of the benefits. Maybe you give benefits for the gym. Do you send people on vacation to the Bahamas? And it turns out that there are ways to use money that is economically less efficient, but actually get people to be more motivated, care more, and actually become more productive.

Speaker 1:          26:16          So this is a you can think of is the Baby Jessica Fair trade. When Baby Jessica fell to the well and she really suffered and her parents must have been incredibly miserable. She got more CNN and coverage in Rwanda and for right then the question is why? Why does this happen and why do people care so much? And it turns out there's the research on what's called the identifiable victim effect and the question is if you have, how many lives are at stake and how much do we care you would that as more live? So at stake, we would care more maybe in the linear relationship or maybe we will care more in the beginning and they'll be kind of a diminishing return. Like we wouldn't care if it's 100 or a thousand, but we care a lot of the bottom range. But it turns out the function is different.

Speaker 1:          26:56          We care a lot about individual life and you care less and less as the pie is the number of people become bigger and this goes to kind of an observation is both stallion and Mother Teresa said, Stalin said one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic, and mother Theresa said in the same spirit, if I look at the masters, I will never act. If I look at the one I will and both of them basically portray this idea that what happened when we kind of think about recruiting ourselves to act against something, it's not about our mind thinking. It's something about to call calculated, thought about what's worthwhile and what's the cost benefit analysis. It's about our heart. It's about our emotions and the question is what can activate emotion and it turns out that an individual case can get us to care versus a big set of cases just becomes statistics.

Speaker 1:          27:52          So this beautiful results by a depth small and George Loewenstein and Paul Slovic that basically say, here's one girl in Africa who's hungry. How much money would you give her? And then two other people, they say, here's the problem of hunger in Africa, they have 3 million kids in Sudan and are 5 million kids here and this. How much money would you give? And people give half as much to Africa. Then they give to the single girl Rokia. It actually gets worse because you said if people give more when it's emotional, then when you statistical, what happens when we give both inflammation will say, hey, here's one girl Rokia. Think, see how sad she is and how much money could help her. By the way, there's 5 million more like her. What will happen? It goes down. It turns out that every time you activate cognition, calculation, thoughtfulness, you turn off the emotion.

Speaker 1:          28:45          People care less and give much less. And of course this explains a little bit, Eh, the, the kind of imbalance between what we give to and what we don't give to. So think about how difficult it is to get money for prevention of diseases, prevention of malaria or prevention of diarrhea or deworming kids in the world. You know, lots of kids have have worms. And it turns out that those things are incredibly important, incredibly useful. You can actually get people to be much, much healthier, but it's not motivating, right? Deworming of kids or you know, a million kids in India just doesn't make you feel warm and fuzzy or preventing kids in the future from getting malaria is again, not that exciting. But if you can help one person, specific concrete get something, we all get very excited from it. So there is a real imbalance between what really matters and what we care about and what we give time and money to.

Speaker 1:          29:45          If you run the not for profit, of course you want to build on this on the Russian art is because you care about your non for profit. And I think the example here is of course the American cancer society. They've done a really good job. First of all, the word cancer is great in, in, in, in a minute, recruiting where right? It's an, it's an awful disease. The second thing is the word survivor is really good. And the third thing they do is they create an incredible fear from cancer. I mean, the truth is we all have lots of cancer and we all usually get, get over it. I mean, some, some people of course it dawned, but in our lifetime we'll all have cancerous cells and in most cases it will be just part of the deal of living, um, but, but they created these really negative association that now everybody who had cancer, even if it was not malignant, that will not cause them to die or it was so slow, it will take 50 years to develop and they're called everybody at cancer survival.

Speaker 1:          30:37          And because of that, everybody who knows them and everybody who cares about them start caring about about cancer. Now, uh, you know, it's kind of interesting because they basically have mastered this issue, right? They've mastered making it central focal, created very strong fear about, about cancer and, and caring embodied. Then they basically get a lot of money and if you look at them as a non for profit, they are an incredibly wealthy non for profit. In fact, there are other non for profit field that they're Kansas. It is getting so much money that people just don't give to other causes because they give so much to that cause and now there's all kinds of movements to basically stop the status as a nonprofit because they're so wealthy and they spend so much money on salaries and, and so on. But, but in a sense of understanding human psychology, uh, they are the top. Basically.

Speaker 1:          31:30          There's lots of lots of behavior like this. So, so the, the basic, uh, essence is a trade off between the short term and long term. Kind of a personal story about this, uh, when, when I was in hospital a long time ago, I got to liver disease from bad lunches, fusion and for a long time they didn't know what it was. And from time to time I would get some liver infection. And it was, it was kind of bad in about seven years after I got to India, that was already out in the hospital. I was in Grad school. I had another flare up. I checked myself into a hospital and they found out it was hepatitis C and they, there was an experimental treatment at that time called Interferon, so why don't you try, why don't you try this? I was very happy to try it because you know who would want to die from liver cirrhosis and they basically got these injections.

Speaker 1:          32:18          I had to inject myself three times a week for a year and a half and these injections basically symbolize for me, they kind of the essence of the human condition. He was an injection that could potentially be very useful for me 30 years later, but what happened is that he also had very bad side effects, so every time I would take an that would be sick for about 16 hours. Vomiting, shaking fever, nothing really terrible compared to liver cirrhosis, but for sure unpleasant and now and here's the question, liver really important. Injections, slightly important but now in for certain and that's basically the trade off we have everything. It's about saving, not good for now, good for the future. Exercising, not good for now, good for the future. Dieting, not good for now, good for the future, safe sex, not so good for now, good for the future.

Speaker 1:          33:12          Lots of things have this trade off in terms of that when we face these tradeoffs, we often do what's called the present bias focus. We focus on the present too much and as a consequence, we undermine the long term, the long term effect. This is the problem with Adam and eve and you can ask yourself, you know, who would ever give in eternity in the garden of Eden for an apple? Well, if you ever texted and drive at the same time, you basically have done this mistake, right? And most people have texted while driving and, and, and why do we do it? It's not because we weigh the cost benefit analysis and we say it's a really good idea to text while driving. It's because we're tempted at the moment to do something that we realized it was really stupid from the longterm perspective. Now, back to my story, when I, after a year and a half, uh, there were two pieces of good news.

Speaker 1:          34:03          The first one was that my liver was working fine and there was no trace of the disease, and the second thing is that doctors told me was that I was the only patient that I ever had who took the medication on time. The question is, how could I do it? Do I have nerves of steel and might not succumb to the imputation? The answer is, of course, we also come to temptation all the time. There's no difference, but what I did was I found a trick in my trick is that I love movies. If I had time, I watched lots and lots of movies, so every Monday, Wednesday and Friday on the way to school, I would stop at a video store. I would run two or three videos. I really wanted to see how with carry them in my backpack the whole day. Anticipating watching them, I would get home, I would give myself the injection, I would push a video in.

Speaker 1:          34:48          I would get the bucket that we get the blanket. I was already to the side effect and I will start the video immediately. I would wait for the side effect to settle in. I started immediately. Now you can ask yourself, do they really care about my liver? And the answer is no. The fact is that delivery is really important in me and all the other patients should have kept on taking your medication on time because of the liver, but it wasn't strong enough. So what did I do? I substituted deliver with movies. Now you might say this is a stupid idea. Liver is really important. Movies not that crucial. If you asked me what do I prefer, movies or liver, you know, there's no question, but because deliveries in the future, it was vastly discounted because the movies were in immediately. It was actually motivating me and we call this reward substitution when I behave as if I care about my liver by actually caring about movies and I think there's actually a big lesson though.

Speaker 1:          35:41          You can think about how do we get people to care about their health and money and a longevity and so on. Can we really get people to wake up everyday and care about those things? That will happen 30 years from now. The answer is really very difficult, expensive and unlikely, but can we find other reward substitution? Can we get people to behave because of other things in a way that would make them behave as if they care about the things that are doing for. So why do people go to the gym, right? Do they really wake up every morning worrying about how they will look, feel like 30 years from now? Probably not, but can we get them to do some of these about the moment that actually get them to behave because they do something that makes them care about behaviors if they care about something else. And I think that reward substitution actually provides a general answer to lots of problems in, in human behavior. We just need to find out what these rewards can be.

Speaker 1:          36:42          Absolutely. So if you think about the question of trust and revenge, that's a great example, right? The fact is that we're live in a society. We're inherently social animals, unlike some other species, and because of that we need things that kind of connects us in a social way. So we have this social utility in which we just care about other people now that's create lots of problems. For example, if you do a favor to me, I like you more and then it might put me in, in, in conflict of interest because they would want to reciprocate in some way or in a trust and revenge and all of those things. So the fact is that there are some things that we are irrational and we would have liked to fix it, but there are some things where irrationalities actually what allows us to live in a society and if we lived as individual organisms that basically had no social ties and we're just working each one of us separately, it will be a very different social structure, but we might want to actually have different strategies for decision making.

Speaker 1:          37:40          But because we're inherently social animals, there's all kinds of things that make that are irrational from the perspective of thinking that everybody's a social is a, is a selfish maximizer, but nevertheless make sense when you think about people as social items. The other thing of course is about processing information. So the fact is that we have a limited brain, you know, we're kind of limited physically in many ways, right? We can jump very high. We can't sustain cold or heat. I mean, think about all the stuff in the world that we do to make yourself more comfortable. We have chairs and clothes and glasses and headphones. I mean, lots and lots of stuff. It turns out our brain is also not perfect, right? In the same way that our bodies are not perfect, we can't do everything we would like to do. We're not superman and our brain is also not perfect.

Speaker 1:          38:27          Our brains process information in a certain way, and the reality that we experience is not out there. It's in here. That's what gives us the. The brain gives us the world brought to us courtesy of our brain and it's processing ability and because the brain is not perfect, the way we get information and process it is also not perfect and that's just kind of functional structural limitations to how rational we can be. And the fact is that we better recognize if it's really good to recognize it, understand the limitation, then act accordingly. Because if we don't, we'll just make more and more mistake. We'll just assume that we can be perfect. We'll create the world as if people would create, can be perfect. And we'll just set ourselves to this appointment time after time.
