Speaker 2:          00:09          I picked it. Um, I was conditioned that an early age to appreciate nature photography through my grandfather who's a, he was Irish and, um, he left Ireland in the 1920s and moved to India and then the, he was a doctor and, um, and in the early part of his life, he was engaged in safaris and whatnot, which is not that glorious, uh, looking back in retrospect because he shot tigers and whatnot. But in the twenties and thirties, you know, I suppose it had a different type of a social imprint as we might examine today. But in his midlife, he traded has a, is gone for a camera.
