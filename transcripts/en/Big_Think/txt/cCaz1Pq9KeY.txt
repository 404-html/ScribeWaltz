Speaker 1:          00:06          It's fairly neat. It's both the head of state and the head of government. And that's pretty rare.

Speaker 2:          00:14          I mean, the head of the government, the head, the head of government, we expect to fulfill a litany of duties and we get in there and do a, b, c, d, e, whatever. The, how to stay is special. The head of state is, is, is ideally a reflection of our better selves. A heightened version of the common man or a woman. This person that kind of embodies all that America should be. And you know, to George Bush, to his credit, he doesn't stint on, on who he is. I mean, he puts it out there to be embraced or rejected. And, um, um, and that's what's so weird is that, that the Bush administration, this is a side point, but

Speaker 3:          01:05          okay.

Speaker 2:          01:06          The Bush administration is visionary. I mean, no one can ever claim that there was anything incremental about this administration. It was, it's been a visionary administration with terrible eyesight.
