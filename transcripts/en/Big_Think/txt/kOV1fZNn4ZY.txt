Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:10          well my advice is really to follow your passion. I mean study something that interests you but also qualifies you to apply. It's a, as I said, NASA recruits from a wide variety of backgrounds. You have to have a bachelor's degree at least in science or engineering. But, uh, pick the field that you like, you know, um, I know people who have applied to be astronauts who, who asked me, well, should I do this, should I do that? And I said, you don't, it doesn't matter. The basic requirements are you have to be in good health and you have to have a good heart. I mean, in a technical way, not so much be a kind person while, although that helps. But, um, you know, study something that you like and do well in it.
