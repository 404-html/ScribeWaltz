Speaker 1:          00:02          Let me start a different place first and then come through exactly what you want. Um, I was born in 1933 is that Adolf Hitler was being elected, the chancellor of Germany and some of my earliest images is that young lad in the movie theaters in the 19 forties was really the opening of the concentration camps by allied troops. And then more and more as the weeks went on, film became available and we could say these bodies being heaved like sacks of earth or something like that up on the trucks, off the trucks. And, and, um, uh, I, that frightened me a bit when I was young, but it also impressed me that he had a life could be a lot more meaningless than we think it is. A not nearly so comfortable. Who of those people thought a year before that they would be so treated? I'm 100 million people in Europe alone.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I lost their lives by violence in the 20th century. So when I read Haig only said history is a butcher's bench chair. Sure sounded true to me. So, um, I'm, you know, I, this, this sort of sense of the possibility of darkness and chaos and meaninglessness and a cruelty and barbarity at the heart of things that seemed always to be alive in my conscience. Uh, you know, I don't remember a time when it, when it hasn't been there. Um, and then I studied for a long time to become a priest and I, you know, spent more than a decade in a monastery is too strong a word because it's a more modern now the order of the holy cross fathers, little bit like the Jesuit, they teach it, he run Notre Dame and Stone Hill College, my alma mater and so forth.

Speaker 1:          01:52          But we used to pray, we admitted our regular schedule, regular hours of the day, a long day. But, um, we, we hit about four hours or more set aside for prayer, much of it together, much of it private. I'm alone. And, and there are often days and weeks where I just didn't have any feeling for God at all. When you, when I, you know, I, I did so much doubt. But nonetheless, I did wonder sometimes whether all this is a fraud or a, you know, am I kidding myself or deceiving myself, but I learned that, that this is a pretty common theme and, and you should be, you should be glad that these adult moments and they're learn too well. What do you do? I love the text of St John's letter m

Speaker 1:          02:51          where he says, how do you know that you love God and either you wouldn't be in a seminary or a kind of, and if you didn't think you love God, but how do you know? Um, it's not enough just to say that. And he said by this, do you know if you love God, if you have love for one another. And so the moments of darkness ought to lead you to be more kind and receptive to others, especially the ones that get on your nerves. Uh, especially the ones that are hard to deal with the gods in them too. After all. And, and I say that just as a way of negotiating the darkness. It's not that you suddenly feel lighter constellation, but this seems like the North Star, this seems like the right, the True Path and some favorite saints in mind. Carmelites mostly not mother Theresa, but St Theresa of Louisiana's and Teresa of Avila, um, live through this darkness were marvelous books about it and guidebooks homeless if you want.

Speaker 1:          03:57          And I think they're onto something real and deep and into, and the Inter religious, you know, you find in every religion you find the deepest people understand this very well and can talk about it very well. The more shallow people makes them nervous, but I religion that intends to be universal. It is meant to be universal as in different ways that Judaism and Christianity or, um, has got to be a shallow enough for ants to wade through and deep enough to drown giraffes, if you know what I mean. It's gotTa have room for all types.
