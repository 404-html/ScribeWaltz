Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:03          when you look at us, us as humans, as apes, as primates, as mammals, when you look at some of the most appalling realms of our behavior, much of it has to do with the fact that social organisms are really, really hardwired to make a basic dichotomy about the social world, which is those organisms who count as us and those who count is them and this is virtually universal among humans and this is virtually universal among all sorts of social primates that have aspects of social structure is built around separate social groupings of them's. We turn the world into us as investors and we don't like them very much and are often really awful to them and the is. We exaggerate how wonderful and how generous and how affiliated and how. Just like siblings, they are to us. We divide the world into us and them and one of the greatest ways of seeing just biologically how real this fault line is, is there's this hormone, oxytocin.

Speaker 2:          01:09          Oxytocin is officially the coolest grooviest hormone on earth because what everybody knows is it enhances mother infant bonding and it enhances pair bonding and couples and it makes you more trusting and empathic and emotionally expressive and better at reasoning, reading expressions, more charitable, and it's obvious that if you just like spritzed oxytocin of everyone's noses on this planet, it would be the garden the next day. Oxytocin promotes prosocial behavior until people look closely and it turns out oxytocin does all these wondrous things only for people who you think of as an us, as an in group member. It improves in group favoritism, in group parochialism. What does it do to individuals who you consider then it makes you crappy or to them more preemptively, aggressive, less cooperative, and an economic game. What oxytocin does is enhanced this us and them divide so that along with other findings, classical lines of us versus them along the lines of race, of sex, of age, of social, economic class.

Speaker 2:          02:22          Your brain processes these us them differences on the scale of milliseconds. A 20th of a second, your brain is already responding differently to an US versus them. Okay, so collectively, this is depressing as hell. Oh my God, we are hardwired to inevitably be awful to them's and them's along all sorts of disturbing lines of, Oh, if only we could overcome these us, them dichotomy's, the worldly. Oh No. Are we hard wire to divide the world along lines of race and ethnicity and nationality and all those disturbing things and what becomes clear is when you look closely is it is virtually inevitable that we divide the world into offices and thems and don't like them very much into treat them well, but we are incredibly easily manipulated as to who counts as an us and who counts is of them and those fault lines that we view as, oh my God, how ancient can you get that?

Speaker 2:          03:22          Say somebody of another race of volks limbic responses in US commensurate with they are them. They respond, they motivate automatic responses. Oh my God. Is that just the basic fault line and then you do something like have faces of same race versus other race and either they are or aren't wearing a baseball cap with your favorite team's logo on it and you completely redefined who's in us. US is people who like the Yankees and them are red sox fans and suddenly you're processing within milliseconds what damn baseball cap they haven't race as being completely ignored. Oh my God, we are negatively hardwired to make really distressing us that were manipulated within seconds as to who counts as us as event. Good news with that, we can manipulate us out of some of our worst us, them dichotomy's and recategorize people. Bad News. We could be manipulated by all sorts of audio logs out there as to deciding that people who seem just like us really are into.

Speaker 2:          04:28          They're really so different that they count as of them. Okay, so fabulous study showing this, this double edged quality to oxytocin and this was a study done by a group in the Netherlands and what they did was they took Dutch university student volunteers and they gave him classic philosophy problem. The runaway trolley problem, is it okay to sacrifice one person to save five runaway trolley? Can you push this big beefy guy onto the track who gets squashed by the trolley, but that slows it down so that five people tied to the attractive standard problem at philosophy, utilitarianism and justifies means all of that. So you give people the scenario and people have varying opinions and now you give them the scenario where the person you push onto the track has a name and either it's a standard name from Netherlands. Dirk, I think who's like a peer to peer or something which like if you're.

Speaker 2:          05:25          This is like a, like a meat and potatoes Netherlandish name or a name from either of two groups that evoke lots of Zena phobic hostility among people from the Netherlands. Someone with a typically German name. Oh yeah. World War II. That's right. That was a problem. Or someone with a typically Muslim name, so now they're choosing whether to save five by pushing dirt onto the track or auto or Mahmoud and in general give them those names and there's no difference in how people would rate it. Then if they were anonymous, give people oxytocin where they don't know that they've gotten it. Controlled group has just placebo spurts up their nose. Give people oxytocin and Kumbaya. You were far less likely to push dirt onto the track and dirk is add, you are now far more likely to push good old auto or good old mom onto the rails there and you are more likely to sacrifice an out group member to save five and you're less likely to sacrifice an ingroup member. All you've done there is exaggerate the US than divide with that.
