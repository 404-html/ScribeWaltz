Speaker 1:          00:11          Trauma is something that's unexpected out of our control and outside of our ability to prevent it. And so that really by definition is a loss. You can have the loss of life, the loss of physical control, which is an injury, the loss of emotional control, which is a mental health need. You can have a financial loss. So loss of that nature brings trauma

Speaker 1:          00:41          and mass casualty can take the form of a violent crime or an individual's involved in harming lots of other people. It can be a natural disaster. It can be a combination of those things. Many times in the public, people don't know how to respond and so they kind of default to what they would perceive to be something that's helpful. So donating clothes, knitting things, sending food, this kind of thing. And ironically, in many situations that's not really that helpful. Somebody drove a truck, a tractor trailer full of fruitcake and actually parked it in the middle of the disaster zone. You know, one, forget it would be funny actually, but you know, in in the midst of this natural disaster, it's not the right kind of resources that to big people typically need. They need other kinds of resources and those needs, uh, commonly revolve around immediate safety and security issues.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Uh, immediate, immediate emotional support and then time to recover to some degree. What do you typically get when you say, well, is there anything I can do for you? Well, there's nothing. You know, I'm, I'm fine when at that casket, when you make that comment to that widow at her, you know, her husband's visitation, she's not thinking, yeah, the grass hasn't been mowed and my mortgage needs to be paid and the dog needs to be let out. All very practical things. And many times that's really what we need to focus on. How do we discover those practical needs by asking them

Speaker 1:          02:17          in the aftermath of a situation, people are recovering emotionally, physically, financially, and many times those needs are lifelong. If a person loses his or her job and can't work, that's an issue of disability. That's a need. Paying funeral expenses, dealing with medical expenses, medical bills, sometimes they're still trying to make their house payment. Do they have resources to be able to manage with that? Do they have the ability to get worker's comp or longterm disability that can be questionable? A manager of a compensation program is State Compensation Program told me that they consider the average cost of a shooting victim who survived to be roughly $50,000 that's, that's the calculable consideration for their costs, their expenses, and so even just financially, you know, that's, that's where donations can be helpful and so it's important for the public to be thoughtful, to make sure that whatever account that you might be contributing to is actually the legitimate take an extra step or to ask some questions to do a google search and to make sure it's legitimate and authentic.

Speaker 1:          03:35          When you think about how we respond to a person, we challenge people to ask the question, am I really defining their trauma for them by the statement that I'm making? For instance, God wanted your loved one more than you did. That's why he took your loved one. Well, when you kind of examine that phrase, what are we really doing? We're defining that loss for that individual. Most people who are experiencing that kind of loss would say, that's not helpful. I don't find actually that that is comforting to me. Comforting phrases, truly comforting phrases are really the kind of phrases that empower the person to have control. One of the big phrases that we use really in terms of crisis intervention is, I'm so sorry that your loved one died and use that person's name. I'm so sorry that bill died because we're, we're affirming the value of that person that they've lost and we're affirming the reality of what they've experienced. Now, the easiest thing, believe it or not, is to say nothing, and that can be helpful just to be with a person. If we don't know what to say, you can simply say, I'm here with you. I just want to support you.
