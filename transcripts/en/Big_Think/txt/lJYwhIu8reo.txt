Speaker 1:          00:10          Incredible the last day have put America in such jeopardy in so many ways. I mean the fact of these trillions of dollars of debt we have now, that's going to be a huge burden to arrive with the fact that global warming, as nothing has been done about it. Even Mccain now says he's, you think something has to be done about it. Lord knows he changes his mind so often. We don't know how long that will stay, but I'm, I'm the Iraq war of course is a huge issue. And the economy, unemployment, immigration, I mean the person who's job one should really want, um, these are, these are really incredible issues. I think from what I've seen of him, um, his basic intelligence will allow him to assemble a team. I mean, basically a president is a team. It's hardly a single person will allow him to assemble people to help begin those problems. And the fact that he's such an inspired arbiter or some people almost hold against him, I think is very, very crucial. Very crucial at this time that someone will be able to speak and convince people what they have to do, convince the country, convince them that there's hope. First of all. I mean, America has never apparently in all the polls express so much of a lack of hope in anything. And I think the fact that he is that inspiring could be very, very important. Will be very assuming you went to

Speaker 1:          02:02          bruce. I mean, that's where Kennedy is remembered for Kennedy made a lot of terrible mistakes. But what he's remembered for is that, that there was a moment when people felt as though there were light. I think that's partly, that's a good part of what a leader does. A leader finds the positive things, finds what we can do. Um, the reason Bush's administration was so despairing to so many of us was that it was based in fear. It was a constant repetition of fear. We have to be afraid of this. So we have to do that. We have to be afraid of that. So we can do this. And um, and this is what's happened is that people now are really in a state of anguish, didn't have to be that way.
