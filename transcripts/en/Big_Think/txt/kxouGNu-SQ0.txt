Speaker 1:          00:07          Well,

Speaker 1:          00:10          even the extravagant spending proposals, which is what I'm calling for it, we're talking about on the order of four percent of GDP now, we have debt. I should check that number. I believe we have a debt GDP ratio and then 50 percent ish range right now. That's not good. It's been rising in, in, in the absence of a major war, which is not supposed to happen, but I look at other advanced countries they've managed to have or ourselves. We had a debt to GDP ratio of 125 percent at the end of World War Two and paid it down and never. There was never a question about the good faith and credit of the US government. Even advanced countries with fairly weak governments, uh, Belgium, Italy have managed to have a debt debt equal to or greater than GDP. So we have a lot of running room as long as there's a reasonable presumption that we will in the end, do what's necessary to bring our finances under control. It's not that we can't afford to spend this much. Um, it's and, and the, the alternative not, not providing the stimulus is just to run the risk of a truly frightening.
