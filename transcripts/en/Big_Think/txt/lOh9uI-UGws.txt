Speaker 1:          00:09          It is very difficult to it on the same thing. It's like a person wants to stop smoking, right? They're addicted to smoking and he's not so hard to stop one, two, three days. But most people will relapse after two or three days. The same thing with, with uh, with diets and food for once these, these changes that'll cure these condition responses. Number one are long lasting. So you are going to be constantly inhibiting these pre potent, uh, nice to actually want to it. Now Imagine Your Day, 24 hours. I sort of sorts of the managing my day 24 hours in the morning and go run exercise. I'm all all wired up so I have perfect control. Nothing bad has happened to me. But then I basic alley loose, loose my key on, I have to make these huge line and then the secretary insults me and I have to say, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not going to get.

Speaker 1:          01:12          So you start to get frustrated. I'm frustrated and frustrated and angry and angry and your ability to then regulate this urge to eat the food starts to be on their mind. So as we get frustrated, as we get stressed, our ability to exert control gets diminished. So you're going to die then this is one, one of the reasons is not the only reason, and I'll, I'll come back to it in a second. The ability to exert control, to control our emotions and our behaviors gets eroded when we're stressed, when we're tired or actually when we're full deprived and that's why people become irritable. This is actually, it's a response where your, your brain, your body sensing that you are in a state of deprivation and under a state of the premade Bayesian, your main full state changes to go and want to do that behavior that will get you out of that state.

Speaker 1:          02:16          So you have again that balance of an intense drive to get out of that very unpleasant state and on the other one your cognition and says, I want to lose weight, I want to lose weight and there is a point that you do lose. You lose this battle and so you give in and you get a stressor comes up. The flight has been canceled. I've been dealing with all of these, these psych had a bad day on my flight on top of everything gets canceled. And at that moment you lose the ability to control. So that's one of the things I need to, exactly the same thing with drugs or weed smoking behavior. A person he's doing fine and all of a sudden their spouse says, you know, I want the divorce when they have been stopped smoking and then they relapse. Something very, very stressful. They lose that ability.

Speaker 1:          03:02          There are all other things that, that are um, being, um, shown by animal stories that may also being very, very provocative. And again, this is at the research level in animals. It hasn't been shown in humans, but in my view, the moment that I started to see results like that in animals, I want to question, is this happening in humans? There's been a series of stories now by Dr Hobble, uh, for many years. And I, I, when I read these I said, wow, where he takes rods on key, gives them a diet high in sure we'll, we'll eat the societies a lot of sugar. Well, he takes these little ruts and gives them high amounts of sugar and then he takes these animals and gives them, I draw that we call an opiate antagonist now. Why do you say an opiate? The Taiwanese and not being a townie.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Some medication that when you give to a rat only when you give it to a rod that has been repeatedly exposed to opiates like I'm caroline. Morphine, oxycontin, repeated exposure only when it's repeated, you gave that you trigger, I withdraw like a heroin withdraw. The animus satish shatters. It's gets to shake and a, it's very, very unpleasant for the animal. When a kid these these opiate antagonist into an animal that has been exposed to high content of sugar, he triggers an opiate withdraw. This is incredibly unpleasant. Now, one of the things that we haven't studied in humans is could there be something similar that they're eas are we draw out just like it's been shown in animals or Kurian when a person is a stops in a diet and then they basically are courting the intake of sugar which liberates endogenous opiates, so no longer those endogenous opiates are being liberated and your creating a mile state of withdraw that he's not of course so powerful that you recognize it, but that may be creating this state of dysphoria and discomfort.

Speaker 1:          05:09          This is artifactually factually, which is what happens when you put someone on on withdrawal. Maya withdrawal from opiates. It's not like they're going to start shaking, but there's a sense of discomfort. It's just you're not feeling well on your Stinger like like that and it's very unpleasant. And so the, the extent to which a similar process, for example, maybe happening is something that should be investigated that could also, if proven correct, help to understand why so very difficult to go into a diet. And we'll also, if it's again, a document that in humans, because this is documented in animals, could provide a strategist to help so on, so that they don't have these very, these very disagreeable state of discomfort.
