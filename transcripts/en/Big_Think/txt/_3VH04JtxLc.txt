Speaker 1:          00:13          Well, um, I had been to Afghanistan, uh, previously that was my first covering of a war, but I had written for rolling stone for a few years. And the short answer is I would always write about youth subcultures, like skateboarders, criminals, radical environmentalist. And I pitched my editor the idea that, hey, I'll cover the military. It's another youth sub culture. Um, but I think the other reason I wanted to go to Iraq because I studied history in school. I was fascinated by it more actually. And I had also previously worked at Hustler magazine as a, as an editor, as an editor there. And I, I always felt that when I worked at Hustler, we are beneficiaries of the first amendment. And I thought, now here's another way to, um, to, to live the first amendment. The military is giving me the opportunity to cover the war from the front. And I feel it.

Speaker 1:          01:19          Um, when I first covered troops, it was in Afghanistan and I was a little, I spent a month with a heavy weapons platoon in Kandahar. And with those guys, I was always sort of like, should I let them know that I worked for hustler cause I thought maybe they'll be angry or some it'll offend some born again Christian or something. And it, it got out and it really increased my respect and acceptance in that platoon. So by the time I got to Iraq or to, to the Marine Corp prior to the invasion of Iraq, I kind of knew in a minute, in a manipulative journalistic way that hustler was a good card to play. Um, but it's more of a humorous thing. Like they, I knew that they would laugh about it. Um, what really I think made them accept me as much as they did and not everyone accepted me was just the fact that I stayed with them and I believe in journalism, nothing beats, um, time and persistence. Just follow people around and they kind of, it breaks down the barriers. The fact that I followed them around after we were getting shot at and ambush of course also helps.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:34          In Afghanistan, we had some rocket attacks and there are big issues with land mines that were blowing people up. That was a different sort of tension the first time. In fact, it was a worst, just the fear of the fear of landmines that we had in Afghanistan was worse than actually being shot at. And the first time I was really shot at was at the bridge at Nasiriyah, which will be depicted in episode of the mini series. And it was like, strangely enough, very exciting. And it was strangely enough, I, I, and this was voiced by marines that were by my side, it was like, wow, this is just like a movie. And it's weird to me that my reference point and their reference point was movies. But that's the case. It was, I mean to see, um, you know, and for some reason to have like a mortar blow up sort of near you and you feel the overpressure and you to see a machine gun fire tearing into trees over your head, even though it's scary. It's very exciting.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Well, I think that, um, they were all dangerous. I mean, once you start getting shot at, you know, who knows? But who knows what's going to happen. But for me, this happened time and time again. We were in a convoy moving forward. So at times a unit would have moved ahead of us and they would say, okay, you're going to have enemy contact in five minutes when you, when you reached this turn in the road. So then you're in the Humvee and you know, hey, the last guys that drove up here, they took rpg and machine gun fire. It's going to happen to you next. It was the anticipation that was always the scariest.

Speaker 1:          04:34          Well, when I came back from Iraq, um, a lot of my friends were like, oh, you know, wow, you were in combat. It must be, you saw something that no one else could ever understand unless they've been there. And actually I disagreed with that. The weirdest thing is there was an element of being in combat that confirmed to me what I'd read about it. And I'd read studied history. So I'd read a lot about it. And it was weird as a writer and a person who's sort of live the life of the imagination, I was like, wow, it's really cool that my imagination did actually prepare me for what combat would be like. So there was an element of it that was very familiar based on my intense reading as a history student. But the one thing that I really saw in Iraq graphically and I'd never quite understood was how attractive war is for the combatants.

Speaker 1:          05:26          That basically in Iraq you had these young Marines who had prepared for war and it was pretty exciting for them to finally get a chance to be in it. And on the other side, many of the people that were attacking us, we're professional Iraqi soldiers now, many of them were actually working as insurgents because the, the Saddam's military had prepared for an insurgency as we invaded, but they were professional combatants. So you had these young men on both sides that were sort of fulfilling their dreams. They, it was, it was very self actualizing for the Marines, as I'm sure it was for the Iraqis. And, and it was a war is attractive to those guys. But in between is this massive civilians who are being slaughtered, who are suffering. And I'd never quite realized a, that, uh, for combatants war is kind of attractive and be that truly what happens in war is just civilians just get fucked. You know, there's no there, there is no glory. There's nothing for them except for pain, misery, death, suffering. And you really see it in Iraq. I really saw it.

Speaker 2:          06:41          Okay.
