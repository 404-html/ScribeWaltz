Speaker 1:          00:06          People are not fully rational and then they do, they make many choices that if they reflected upon them they would do differently. There's no question about that and we have a fair understanding actually of what is happening, at least at the individual level of my senses that we have explored a lot of what is happening. I wouldn't say there's going to be no further progress, but we've explored in law, um, the major tendencies, well the major tendencies to people tend to frame things very narrowly. They take a narrow view of decision makings. They look at the problem at hand and they deal with it as if it were the only problem. Very frequently. It's a better idea to look at problems as they will recur throughout your life and then you look at the policy that you to adopt for a class of problems. Difficult to do would be a better thing.

Speaker 1:          01:02          People frame things narrowly in the sense, for example, they will save and borrow at the same time instead of somehow treating their whole portfolio of, of assets as, as one thing. If people were able to take a broader view, they would in general make better decisions. So that is certainly one, one of the weaknesses of human decision making, we call it narrow framing. Mental accounting, you know, is is a big deal. This is the way that we live. So we have, we have, we keep our money in different mental accounts for which we have different rules, so people will, well of course they spend, they're spending money. Um, but then there is a hierarchy of the accounts that they will touch. They will spend money that they've stalled for vacation, what often before they will spend whatever they're thinking of a savings for their children's education.

Speaker 1:          02:01          So those are mental accounts for which people have different rules more foolishly versus pretty sensible because mental accounting is a tool of self control. But more foolishly, investors tend to view each stock that they buy as a mental account and they want to sell it, uh, when it is a winner. And so they tend to sell their winners and hang on to their losers in their portfolio. And that turns out to make them substantially poorer than if they had done things differently. And you need to be numerate for certain kinds of decisions. So numerous people have a significant advantage over those who are not understanding compounding compound interest. And it makes a huge difference whether you're a credit card borrower or somebody was saving. People have a very hazy idea of compound interest and, and it's very, so I would say that first of all you need to be numerous that many people are then, then you need to frame things broadly.

Speaker 1:          03:08          I mean that's a, it frequently goes with numeracy but it's not quite the same thing. Uh, and then by taking the broad view, it is very important not to have overly strong emotional reactions to events. And what I mean by that is that most of us tend to respond to gains and two losses, two changes that happen in our life. Actually, you're better off if you frame things broadly and you think you win a few, lose a few, and you have very limited emotional response to small gains and two small losses that tends to induce better decision making.
