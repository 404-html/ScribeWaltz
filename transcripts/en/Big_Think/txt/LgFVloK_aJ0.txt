Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          I think that researchers themselves could do a better job of trying to explain to the public what it is we do. So first of all, I would like to say that we need to do more of this. Um, and I think that the public, if we take the time to do that, um, will have different viewpoints. Of course we're a heterogeneous and diverse society, but, uh, unless we do more of that, uh, we can't say that the public has misperceiving if we don't give them the information to evaluate. Um, I, I think that, uh, there are many elements that we can explain and speak less than a scientific jargon. Um, uh, and, uh, actually work a communication specialist frankly, to get messages out in different languages and different, uh, different levels. You know, why not let fourth graders here about what we're doing at the level of fourth grader university students, medical students, medical professionals have different ways of communicating with the different, uh, constituents in society.

Speaker 2:          01:13          There are many organizations now that, um, because the public votes with their, their, their checkbook, in other words, their taxes on the people they elect. We have to go to the public, uh, and particularly around public private partnerships, uh, that we want to build from the private sector with, with a, a civil society and with the public sector, we need to be out and to say, you know, what it is, you know, what our core values are, what our mission is, what we can do to be part of the solution, not to take on the whole problem. Uh, and to build these partnerships with the public sector.

Speaker 2:          01:50          I am worried that, uh, there is mistrust between the public and academia, uh, and uh, with public entities as well, but particularly with the pharmaceutical industry. Um, so w we have many corrective actions that we've taken. We are trying to respond and get feedback, uh, on, on what type of activities we need to improve ourselves on. But I would like to see us on a much more positive trajectory where it is clear that what we are doing is delivering what the public wants, the diseases they want us to work on. And the public has a lot of voices as well. So we can't satisfy all. Um, all of the needs, but, uh, you know, certainly we want to be a serving medical need, um, in the way that public a regained some competence in what we do.

Speaker 2:          02:45          I think that, uh, many of the issues that the public has with Pharma, we need to listen to and we need to understand those, what their issues are and we need to have an internal dialogue with the, about these things. When that happens, you know, uh, we need to negotiate a, a path out of that. So I think, you know, part of the district trust was around transparency, around data and publication, that data and frankly the safety of our medicines when we explain what the safeguards that we do and the fact that we're a very highly regulated industry more so than, than most industries. And get out with what we're doing that to show that we've heard what they've said to us and then what are our plan are and then to ask them, is that what you had in mind about our, our, our corrective action.

Speaker 2:          03:36          The other thing we can do is just talk about the great science we do. Um, about the lives that are affected by our medicines and our vaccines, about the programs that we build, the disease elimination programs, the health management programs around our therapeutics, because it's not just about the molecule, it's not just about the vaccine, it's about the, the disease management programs that we build into this telling the story, asking our customers are our constituents, you know, how, how are we doing a getting feedback changing course. Um, and I, I think that that, so I, you know, I don't look at the public is having a misperception of us. Um, I, I look at, uh, our need to have more of a dialogue with the public and to evolve science. It's about evolution anyway. So a scientist, we should evolve with the public.

Speaker 2:          04:25          Personally, I'd like to see progress in infectious diseases because, um, uh, you know, we have A. HIV is still a raging pandemic now. Uh, it's not thought about as much in the developed world because, uh, in many Pharma and public private partnerships working with the NIH and other public entities, we now have turned HIV in the developed world into a chronic disease is very treatable, not with the best and not with optimal medicine. So we still have room to go, but the largest part of the, you know, the, the planet with HIV, uh, until recently you had no access and now I'm a, we were making great strides with the Global Fund, pepfar, um, other programs that originated out of a Pharma to get into some of the issues around access. So, but, you know, there are two to three, four, five, um, after HIV. So Tuberculosis, malaria, acute respiratory infections in children, etc. Uh, that, uh, uh, really deserve as much attention I think as hiv. So I woUldn't want to say one thing, I would say let's have a grander vision and tackle the top 10, at least the top 10.

Speaker 2:          05:43          Tacoma is a, is a historical disease. It's, it's mentioned in the greek papaya ray, and it's actually mentioned in the bible and it was in the us, uh, in appalachian on indian reservations after the battle of a denial when, uh, basically, uh, nelson sank the french fleet, the returning navy and soldiers brought tacoma to europe. So this has been a disease in the developed world, but with improved sanitation, uh, the disease has gone away and actually on the reservations with some mass antibiotics. So until the poverty agenda in the north south divide is a really, a solid tacoma is going to be a disease that requires other modalities including antibiotic treatment. Uh, but agaIn, I believe that with the current mobilization that, that the disease is within reach, tacoma is caused by a bacteria. It's usually crowding and in poor conditions and with repeated infections of the eyes, scarring occurs over many years. That leads to blindness. Um, malaria is a mosquito transmitted disease. Um, and uh, actually again, uh, the south all the way up to Washington and this country was a endemic from malaria. Um, but, uh, today 90 percent of malaria and malaria deaths are in subsaharan africa. Um, and, uh, again, the parasites have the advantage because of their sheer numbers and replication that they become quickly resistant to many of the available drugs.

Speaker 2:          07:26          I believe a tacoma tHat, uh, the global Illumination of tacoma is, is within reach by the year 20, 20, and that is our goals. I'm going to the world health organization, uh, tomorrow eVening to be part of that annual meeting. Um, that program iS being linked with other neglected tropIcal disease programs that again, uh, many people in the field have been working on it. But for about fifty cents a year, uh, with four or five already approved medicines, we can look at eight or nine neglected tropical diseases and imagine and actually set metrics around elimination that's different from diseases like malaria where frankly resistances as some of the, the biggest concern. And we really do need a full pipeline from early discovery to a full development to address the continuing evolution of resistance. The parasites of the advantage. Um, there will always be a need for new therapeutics until we eliminate malaria. But I don't see elimination as a, as a, as a real viable strategy for malaria right now.

Speaker 2:          08:36          Very often these are a bacteria, vIruses, or parasites that were formerly a completely susceptible to a therapeutic. Many people don't. so one such a bacteria is mrs. Say, and people hear about it in the news, which is methicillin resistant staph aureus, when fleming first discovered penicillin, penicillin would treat staph aureus that didn't last very long. Other agents have been synthesized, including different penicillins, completely new classes of agents. Um, and I would say now that staph aureus is pretty well served, so what I would expect would be there'll be a lack of a further discovery and development for staff laureus. And maybe in a period of time, five years, 10 years or 15 years, we'll be back to the problem of not having agents with staph aureus. Um, right now, uh, we have gram negative organisms. So these are bacteria that are found in water supplies, especially in hospitals because of the antibiotic pressure.

Speaker 2:          09:44          There were a, again, if you were to get infected with one of these organisms, there may not be a therapeutic that will help any effect against those organisms. These are the super resistant bugs that you asked about in New York city just to make the case locally in the late eighties, early nineties, um, uh, there was relaxed control of tuberculosis and so that patients would be admitted with tuberculosis hospital for isolation and therapy, um, after two weeks would feel better, but they need six more months of therapy. It will be sent out. They would often get disorganized because they were from the inner cities are actually had a mental illness, uh, and this would happen three or four times until they develop multidrug resistant tuberculosis. And in The layman's jargon, a super resistant bug, um, and this was frightening. Um, this situation is now playing out in places like South Africa where they have something called an xdr, a tuberculosis. and so I know I had many patients, I had many, and these epidemics, we'd have outbursts and in clinics and hospitals. So I knew health care providers that were infected and got sick. Um, sometimes both the patients and the healthcare providers were hiv positive that seemed to promote actually the aggressiveness of the bacteria progressing, um, in the, in these patients. So It was quite a frightening situation.

Speaker 2:          11:13          One of the good things about international travel now is that people are more aware of cultures and environments because they're traveling on business to, to emerging markets and frankly, even some of the less developed countries, uh, so I think they're in general is a, uh, what globalization has brought as a more awareness of the, some of the inequities, not just with poverty be with diseases. And uh, you know, I, I hope with some of the economic trouble in the developed world that we don't lose sight of the fact that in the developinG world they are suffering much worse than we are. Um, so that, uh, you know, we have an obligation in the develoPed world, uh, to not lose focus on international development issues.

Speaker 2:          12:01          In the seventies when a nixon announced the war on cancer, um, budgets were decreased for infectious diseases. And this has been well published and talked about in both the scientific and the, in the lay press. Um, and look what happened. Hiv, multidRug resistant tuberculosis. I'm a west nile virus. I think we've responded now what we, we can't do is relax our, a surveillance for emerging diseases, our laboratory capabilities to study these organisms and then to scale up to have useful either therapeutics or vaccines when sars hit and then people would probably prefer forgotten about it was, it was terrifying what, what happened? And it was a, a, a, like an influenza type of illness. Um, and uh, you know, the company I work for actually synthesize 65 compounds in less than a year, uh, in, in a very much of a manhattan project like environment, um, to then the disease went away inexplicably.

Speaker 2:          13:07          Um, so I think that capability to quickly respond. Um, and also, you know, I'm, I'm a firm believer in science evolving, um, in new technologies becoming available. So when it be nice and actually we are working on this technology to have a vaccine response that takes weeks and not nearly a year and in some cases, um, and so there are, there are approaches and we are working in that field as well. Um, so it's about having existing capabilities, uh, and not relaxed in the guard, Both on surveillance of new diseases, but also they built the ability to respond.
