Speaker 1:          00:10          I believe in democracy and liberty that you can not, you can not talk in the name of any people without elections. And you cannot supervise the people in that says, Eh, you, I am not in. Nobody has the roid eh, to, to say what is good and bad for the Egyptian people. They must, uh, truth for themselves. Uh, that is a very, very strong idea in the west. That free elections means in the other boards. Phonetics in public. And this is not true in Egypt is not true. First. Second, I think that we must respect the choice of the people. And third, Egypt has, uh, its first democratic, uh, experience, uh, in the, about that in the 19th century. So I mean, we are not beginning from zero. We have our own experience. And as you say, you have, uh, it's, it's at risk that you'll have terrible people coming be, could be elected any moment there.

Speaker 1:          01:14          But what is very important is how to be able to defend the who own a democratic procedure. And the, this, this could be done easily. Uh, so I see no point are to support Arab dictators. You see and claiming that, uh, they are the only choice because, and I would say even a, the country, I would say that because of the Arab dictators, we are having much more, uh, people going to becoming phonetics everyday because, uh, the WHO would that be? The young generations are not, uh, allowed to express themselves politically because the dictatorship means a total failure in, in every domain. So you'll have more and more desperate people who could be a turning to a phonetic people at any moment. So I think that, that the real solution for the whole outer world is a year at the moment.
