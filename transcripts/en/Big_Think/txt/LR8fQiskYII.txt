Speaker 1:          00:04          Oh boy, that's a really tough question is it's kind of like asking a what are the, what are the five countries you should know about if you're not interested in geology or geography or politics? Um, and the answer varies depending on what your actual interests are or what are the five companies you should know. Uh, but, um, and, and the answer changes over time too. Um, uh, back when I was getting started, Lo these many decades ago, uh, the answers would have been Fortran, cobol, basic lists and maybe Apl, uh, and uh, those were very formative languages back then and people learned a lot from those. But these days, uh, it might be more important for you to know a Java script, even if I'm a, the only reason you know that is, is that you know, whether or not to click the enabled Java script button in your browser, um, but javascript is a nice lightweight object oriented language.

Speaker 1:          01:09          Um, and, uh, that's why it can fit in a browser, uh, and, uh, do these things such as, uh, uh, run little programs that, uh, that, uh, help you input your data. And then send it off to a web server somewhere. Um, there are, there are heavier weight, a object oriented languages. Um, and uh, you know, the elephant in the room is sort of Java. You can't really make a list of modern languages without talking about it. Java is sort of the, uh, the Cobol of the 21st century. I think it's a kind of heavyweight, a verbose. And uh, everyone loves to hate it. I'm not, everyone will admit that, but managers kind of like it because, um, it looks like you're getting a lot done. Um, you know, if 100 lines of Java code, uh, accomplish a task, then it looks like you've written a hundred lines, even though in a different language, it might only take five lines, you know, it's, it's like, uh, you know, you can eat a one pound steak or you can get a, you know, 100 pounds of shoe leather and you feel a greater sense of accomplishment after the shoe leather.

Speaker 1:          02:21          But, you know, maybe there's some downsides. Um, but it also, um, because it is sort of considered an industrial language and programmers, they're sort of interchangeable parts, a managers like it for that reason, and for that reason, a lot of Java jobs that have been outsourced from the United States. Um, oh, what other languages? Um, I think, uh, going in a different direction, coming more from academia, we have a language like a Haskell, which we call a functional programming language that means function in a mathematical sense, not in the sense of the other language or other languages are dysfunctional. Uh, but a function mathematically has an input and an output and it maps to, um, uh, you know, with a great deal of a mathematical certainty what those, what those are. So, um, uh, a Haskell is one of those languages that a mathematician type minded people love.

Speaker 1:          03:36          It's, it's sort of a language for geniuses by Jesus. Um, so you should probably know about it if only to be able to say, well, is this Kinda like Haskell? And if so, then you know, you have to hire some really smart people to, uh, to program manage A. Haskell is sort of a modern kind of lists in that sense. Um, what else? Uh, well, we can't, we can't leave off modern languages without talking about c, the c language that's just spelled with the letter c, m is actually about 40 years old. But, um, people have tried to replace, see with other languages that are, are like it, and have by and large, not succeeded because a c is a very minimalistic language and very close to the metal as we say on a, on a machine and lets you get down and do very fine grain stuff very efficiently.

Speaker 1:          04:35          But it's a lot of hard work. But once you've done that work, you can run it pretty much everywhere. So almost all the other languages that you see, a Java, Perl, whatever, uh, actually if you look down underneath, they're actually implemented and see or, or in a closely related language. So, um, uh, that, that continues to be a very fundamental language if only because everyone is trying to reinvent it and not succeeding in doing so. And finally, um, for a fifth language a, well, you'd probably want to pick one of the scripting languages. Um, there's, there's several to choose from a, there's python, there's Ruby, but of course I am prejudiced in favor of Pearl, uh, because I think it has the, um, the liveliest community. Um, and because, uh, we, uh, have intentionally been redesigning it lightly to leap frog, uh, all the, uh, other languages, uh, for the, for the last number of years we've been redesigning it to take out all the warts that we've noticed over time. And we figured it was our one chance to, um, a break, backward compatibility, break the things that need breaking, keep all the things that make parole parole, keep it a joy to use. And with this make it a language that will be able to be useful and enjoyable for decades. Um, and so, uh, I, I'd recommend Pearl, but I'm known to be prejudiced in the matter.
