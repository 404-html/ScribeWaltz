Speaker 1:          00:10          Well, you know, I have a blog and I've actually written quite a bit on this because you know, if the US capital markets in terms of sophistication or a 10, China's a two. Okay. So China's got a long way to in the capital markets in China. Like when I went to Wall Street in 1973, they were about as developed as that was. Okay. So you know, that's a, that's a negative in one sense, but I think that China could learn a lot from what's happened over the list of the last 10 days, two years, whatever you want to, whatever timeframe you want to pick. Because the US market has gotten so sophisticated, so big, so complicated and you know, now everybody's scratching their head and saying, hey, how do we regulate this? How do we control it? How do we prevent, prevent this from happening again?

Speaker 1:          00:54          This gives China a gigantic opportunity to really look at all this would have everybody's gonna be analyzing and studying about this whole crisis and then to think to themselves about how they then go about the process of taking their capital markets up the curve. So you know, in many ways being the second or the last kid on the block is a lot of times an advantage because you get to kind of see where everybody else has gone through and kind of learn from their experience. And I think that the child would be well served to really look very, very hard and really try to understand how this all happened and then to think about in the context of China and what that means for how China's capital market.
