Speaker 1:          00:11          I don't know how else to describe it, but the joy is seeing it finished. The joy is seeing people using the building, seeing them, enjoying being there, seeing their response to the uniqueness of the place. We have many projects here that are extraordinary. Drawings had beautiful models, but they're not realize, and for me that's the saddest thing because the joy is the realization struggle is getting it realized. The struggle was dealing with a myriad of people that sometimes come and go during the building process. I've been involved in many, many projects were the only person who's there from the beginning to the end is the architect of the people who have prominent positions in decisions that are made aren't there to see what those decisions cause and how they affect what is fine.
