Speaker 1:          00:00          If you start out a side project aiming at it needs to make money, you will make decisions on a complete different level. I think the beauty of a side project is that you are so playful and experimental because you don't put the money component on it. You don't put a layer of money on top of it. So I started my blog as my personal visual archive of things I find online that interests me and inspire me. It was completely meant just to be my personal archive and then slowly but surely I realized because I started looking at my stats and I was like, oh my God, this is not so personal anymore. And eventually I realized, Oh my God, this is a growing community. This is people coming back every day. And then with that, all of a sudden you get companies that come to you and asks you, Hey, Hey, can you put my product up here?

Speaker 1:          00:45          Hey can advertise. And again, this was not meant to be a business. So when all of a sudden the aspect of money comes at me, I had to really do some thinking and like, do I want that? It's just, am I gonna hurt my credibility by putting ads on here? But then the interesting thing was when I was approached by Jim coudal and he told me the concept of the deck network, it totally resonated with what I wanted it to be. Like for example, the deck network, um, is a teeny tiny ed that is on the top left side of my blog. I'm, that rotates a second rss feed that just rotates in and out and it believes in the concept of you can only have ads that are really catered to your audience. So to creative audience. So it's not noise, but it's actually irrelevant.

Speaker 1:          01:36          So I realized, Oh, wait a second, I could actually have advertising on my site that is actually valuable to my readers because he points out maybe tools they would love to use. There is a way that you can add value with advertising if you have a site or whatever it is that somebody wants to give you money for an exchange for eyeballs just makes sure that it adds value to whoever is reading your site, that it is something that you completely stand behind. I will never ever write about something if I don't love it and unfortunately there's too many sites that debt just say, well, we have to bring the Bacon home so we just got to take this advertising and I think that's where you ruin it. That's where you lose the trust of your readers, your audience, and there is nothing that a value more than the trust of the people that come back to my site everyday. Your credibility is all you have and I think it doesn't have to do anything. Whether you run a blog or not, it's in your day to day like don't lose your credibility. Don't sell out.
