Speaker 2:          00:18          There's so many artists out there all over the world that are making art really. I know this sounds idealistic really because they're artists and they just have to make things and they come through the art schools where they don't go to art schools and maybe they are influenced by a trend or a theory. Maybe they even want to make money from art, but they're making art. I've never really met that many people that make our just to make money. There's so many other ways to make money. This is said with investing in the end, to hear about these people that want to make money from investing. You can make so much more money investing the traditional ways then you can from investing in art that there's certain, a certain mythology about that. Even though, yes, of course some people have made money from buying art.
