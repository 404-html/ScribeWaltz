Speaker 1:          00:11          What I'm talking about is something that will take a generation to do what I need to start there is that if we're looking for a healthcare fix for something as complex, uh, with, with, with the previous choices we've made in healthcare, that's going to have a fundamental impact on our system. It's hopeless to too many of us depend on the current forms of financing. I have spent our whole lives participating in it for an instantaneous change and frankly the whole healthcare industry, which is almost a fifth of our economy, has been set up with an existing system. So the first thing you need is a generation commitment. I, it's taken roughly 50 years to create this mess. You're not going to solve it in 12. You're really gonna have to be committed to fundamental change over time. That's a very hard thing for our, or frankly any political system to do other than accidentally we did it accidentally with Medicare and Medicaid and, and company funded insurance to do it intentionally as much harder, but that, that's number one.

Speaker 1:          01:08          It's just a realistic sense of what it's going to take. Beyond that. I think there are really three important elements. Number One, I believe, uh, and I think many Americans do that there really does need to be a true cradle to grave safety net for all Americans for catastrophic health, which is really the initial starting point of many of these debates in some cases over a hundred years ago in the developed world. We still don't have that and I think I think at two, one will be up to near two and a half trillion dollars of spending next year. The number one question we need to ask ourselves is how on earth do we spend two and a half trillion dollars on healthcare a year and not have a true safety net for health catastrophes? For All Americans? That's number one. And to me what that's about is catastrophic insurance.

Speaker 1:          01:55          It actually is an insurable good. Unlike so much of what is uninsured and healthcare, and I start there and it needs to be a national pool because we can't get into the situation. We see now when we have private insurance insurers competing for profit growth in part on how successful they are on underwriting out the worst cases. We can't just let the public pay for the worst cases. It's actually an extraordinarily inflationary approach to creating an insurance. But we need a national poll. Beyond that though, we have to look at funding non catastrophic care, which does include late life care because it's plannable, right? Unlike most insurance events, it's, it's something that we can plan during our life and that we do fund during our life, uh, but also a lot of disease management issues and frankly a lot of routine care in the ways we fund other things in our economy.

Speaker 1:          02:42          How do we do that? We do that out of income, out of savings, out of credit against future savings. And so what I would like to see over time is a shift in the enormous resources that we currently pay to support the insurance system back to consumers to allow them both to fund their current, uh, medical expenses and save for future. Once it has a couple of benefits. Benefit number one is it returns us to our role as consumers. Uh, it, it, it, it does something. We have to start with one, I think now, uh, indisputable fact, which is our 50 year reliance on employers and insurers on governments to control costs have failed, right? W W we will hear endless details of how we can do it better in this odd, this new regulation will finally do it. But if you follow the last 50 years of healthcare, we've tried a lot of different things that Medicare, medicaid, and private insurance and that theory, that big will exercise, leverage and leverage will keep prices down.

Speaker 1:          03:45          You know, if 50 years of the past experience hasn't taught us, that doesn't work, then I guess we'll need more years. But I, I at least not many others believe at some point you say, okay, this doesn't work. What will. Well, the one thing we really haven't tried is to do what works everywhere else, which is to have a mass of desegregated thinking consumers, uh, pushing prices, forcing quality, forcing accountability. That's number one. I, I do want to come back to criticisms with that approach because I think there's some important criticisms of that approach, but that is, you know, where I start the second is we have to avoid the use it or lose it. Approach to financing healthcare and reliance on insurance and on government programs means that every dollar we put into the system is going to be spent on healthcare. If you think about an individual's own life, uh, you save money for rainy days, uh, but if it doesn't rain, you may not apply an umbrella.

Speaker 1:          04:43          The healthcare system doesn't quite work that way, right? Once a lot of the money we take from people to pay for insurance premiums, medicare tax, a medicare premiums down the road is in case you need it. But the very fact it's there means it will be spent on healthcare. Now from an individual's perspective, that may seem irrelevant, but from a society's perspective, it's a real problem because at coming up very soon or 20 percent of GDP, the dollars we're spending on healthcare are things we can't spend on. The other good things in life, and you may be aware of my article, I talk about how we don't even know if we're making the the expenditures that are best for our health. We just know we're making the expenditures that provide the most health care. Those are different things. Nobody can answer the question, would we as a society be better off all giving each ourselves another week vacation?

Speaker 1:          05:34          We're spending another 150 billion on healthcare. They're almost treated differently, but they're not different. Of course we're at a point in our health where over 50 percent of annual deaths come from conditions or causes that have more to do with lifestyle. Uh, this is of course heart disease, diabetes, accident, suicide, homicide. Then they have to do with health care. We've done a great job in healthcare to get to that point. But being at that point, if we're interested in improving our health, we don't know that these investments are better made in healthcare or all the other aspects of health, whether it's recreation or environment or nutrition or what have you, that are being crowded out by society's decision to fund healthcare in a use it or lose it way. So this is less important for the individual, perhaps more important for us as a society. So what I'm seeking to do is I'm seeking to say rather than look for a magic bullet, single way to finance health care, which I think comes out of that early misconception I talked about that healthcare is sort of a lump emergency. Need it, we know what it is, pay for it. That's not true anymore. It's much more complex than that. We need to match the way we finance healthcare to how we use it to what it is. There are emergencies that are catastrophic. Uh, not all of us will have them. It's completely appropriate for insurance to finance them. Insurance is actually the most efficient way to finance them. Insurance that the least efficient, most costly, most distorted way of financing everything else.

Speaker 1:          07:04          The first one is just a financial one, which is people saying, I can't afford it. I have enough trouble affording my deductible. And they are right. The key to this is that generational shift I talk about every year. We need to reduce a bit our reliance on insurance and take some of the resources we use to pay those premiums and get them to consumers. We need to gradually over a 20 year period increased the deductible insurance policies from what they are now to general catastrophic. What that will do is it will move more healthcare resources to individuals, uh, enabling them to finance their care. Now, the only good news about spending two and a half trillion dollars on healthcare is that all of us, and I mean all of us are spending an incredible amount of money on care. We may not be aware of it.

Speaker 1:          07:50          We may think somebody else is paying for it. That's an illusion. You know, one of things I looked at it in my article was hire higher 23 year old today and he spends his entire career with my company and he has a spouse and a couple of kids and a few years and retires at 65 and lives to lady, um, and what would the amount of money that goes into the system for that 23 year old and started them at entry level salary $30,000 a year, uh, which is roughly 60 percent of the average household income in our country. And had him grow that his income grow at three percent over the course of his life, gets a salary, have little over $100,000 by retires. And I made an assumption which hasn't been true for 50 years, which is let's say the growth of all healthcare is only equal to the growth of income, of course has been running one or two points above income.

Speaker 1:          08:42          The amazing thing is that 23 year old is looking at one point $7, million dollars being spent on his or her behalf to fund his household, had medical care over their lives. That's everything that's, uh, their own share of, of, uh, health insurance, their out of pocket. Um, uh, their medicare premiums when they're seniors, the stuff that they actually see, but it's also the stuff they don't see what their employer paid on their behalf. The Medicare tax that came out. Um, and uh, um, uh, what's interesting is I realized later that I understated it because I didn't include the amount of general tax revenues that subsidizing our healthcare, which is another big bite. But let's, let's forget that for a moment. I think if you said to the average 23 year old, you want to participate in this insurance system, or you want a million dollars over your life to spend on your own care, and if you don't spend it on your own care, uh, you can put it away.

Speaker 1:          09:39          The only thing I'm, I ask you to do is I'm going to insist you buy catastrophic insurance. I don't think there's any question what the average 23 year old and say now you say an average 23 year old may not be smart enough to make that decision or longterm, but let's look at the impact on everybody in this country have a healthcare system that costs the average employer who pays insurance 12 grand a year per employee 12 grand. So if you're earning the average income in this country, $50,000, your employer is paying $62,000 was forget about social security tax and Medicare tax, a moment for the privilege of employing you and you're getting only 50 grand. That is an extraordinary aggressive tax. The interesting thing is if you transferred that 12 grand to the average family, they could buy catastrophic care for the whole family and have a significant amount of money, leftover savings, the health savings account or per year.

Speaker 1:          10:31          So you have to be willing to do both. You have to be willing to reduce the coverage of insurance, but transfer those resources to individuals and if you're not willing to do both and people would be afraid that you are. Of course, the you can't have a consumer driven system. The second concern I think a lot of people have is consumers aren't wise enough or smart enough or capable of driving pricing and quality in our healthcare system, and I think as a lot of fundamental reforms have to deal with that seems to be comparing a proposed new approach was something that doesn't exist today. Consumers make all the decisions on their healthcare today. Not the negative ones, but you can't. You can't treat somebody without their choosing the treatment without they're agreeing to the treatment. I'm not proposing getting rid of doctors. I'm not saying let's take the professionals who advise you now out of the system and you design your own treatment and find someone to do it.

Speaker 1:          11:23          What I'm saying is right now we have a system where doctors advise a patients make the ultimate decisions subject to insurance company via. I am removing the insurance company from that equation, but I don't think that most consumers would say, well, that puts me in a terrible position. I rely on my insurance company to help me through my life self care decisions there. There's another thing that I think again comes out of the island nature of health care. Very few of us are true active comparative shoppers and everything we buy. We all benefit from the existence of Walmart, whether we shop there or have ever in our lives compare the price of toothpaste. What happens in a consumer driven economy isn't that every consumer after getting hit by the bus, goes to the Internet and calls up a emergency surgeons to see who to hire and at what price.

Speaker 1:          12:13          What happens is is you benefit from the fact that the entire structure of providers is altered to attract consumers as opposed to serve insurers and governments. That's the. That's the dynamic I'm trying to capture in a consumer centric approach. That dynamic of providers who answer to us patient consumers and not to intermediaries, and if you spend time in a hospital watching a patient be treated, not for a second, can you forget that that patient isn't the customer of that hospital. Can't forget it. You see it in the care in almost every element of the care and if you've been in the rest of our economy and bought anything in the rest of the economy, you know, that's true. Nowhere else. And that's a crucial thing.

Speaker 1:          12:56          I'm not sure there are, there are many. Um, I think some of the objectives, uh, that we've talked about today are things that people are increasingly aware may matter a in resolving this sort of trap we're in, of ever reducing access ever lower quality and ever higher prices. I think one of them is there's an awareness that a lack of competition and a lack of price transparency makes it difficult for consumers to exercise, um, any of the disciplinary force they do in most other industries. There's been a movement in some states, certainly for greater price transparency. Unfortunately it's not true price transparency is list price and of course hospitals don't charge this price for anything. Um, so it's been fairly meaningless, but it's a step. It's an understanding of, of the right direction. One of the interesting things that's occurring, and we've seen it occur and other government programs as well, is that there is the beginnings of something of a shadow economy and healthcare for people who are outside the system, uh, for many of those who either don't have access to health insurance or can't afford health insurance.

Speaker 1:          14:06          Um, there is increasingly a cash and credit based economy around health care services. There are parts of this country you can drive around and see services advertised on billboards on a cash only basis. Um, you obviously see some of these clinics that have opened in walmarts and cvs is, they'd get at one of the, uh, you know, one of the things you would expect to see in a more consumer oriented system, which has real value services, uh, for some of the less complex, a more easy to replicate a treatment, uh, possibilities such as it is many in primary care. Um, but I think we have to be, we have to be candid about the walls around the political process. Now, the reality is most Americans are happy with their health insurance. And I think some pulsate it's 55 or 60 percent, uh, and probably a percentage of those who have health insurance, it may even be higher and as long as that's the case, we're not going to expect any politician to propose fundamental reform. They can't. There are enormous interest groups, uh, that existed in the, in the provision of healthcare, um, who would be opposed to anything that negative that affects the status quo negatively from them. And obviously anything we had real discipline on price would negatively affect the status quo for these interest groups. No politician's going to buck that for a public that believes it's got a good deal at 55 or 60 percent approval. You can't go at the fundamental of the system.

Speaker 1:          15:33          One of the things that I, I mentioned in my article and the reasons I spent a lot of time on numbers is that I think this is actually an illusion. I think much of healthcare policy has been about perpetuating this illusion that somebody else's magically paying for your care. Uh, one of things I talk about is a very common among my fellow liberals is to say, well, if we eliminated advertising and we eliminated the profit motive in order things I mentioned in my, in my articles, if you confiscated the profits of every single American company, forget about the drug companies and the, and the hospital companies and the device manufacture. Just take every prophet, every dollar of profit in the American economy. You'd pay for something like four or five months of our healthcare in two and a half trillion dollars. We're not there yet.

Speaker 1:          16:16          We'll be there next year. I think the number of this year is likely to be somewhere between two, three to four, but two and a half trillion dollars. The only people who can pay for healthcare is all of us and we're all paying for an enormous amounts, right? You hear people talk all the time. And I, one of the reasons I, I, I, uh, have so few friends left, is one of the things I do at dinner parties is talk about, I asked people to mention a healthcare bill I have and I break it down, what do you think the costs of that are? But you'll see a $5,000 bill for something that probably had five or $600 and marginal cost, uh, and you'll recognize just how extraordinary the inflation is, but you'll also recognize that what your friend was worried about was the three or $400 they had to pay against it.

Speaker 1:          16:59          And, um, you know, the difference in that is costing us all a fortune. The moment at which everybody says, you know, it's kind of like having a credit card. I can go out and buy a $2,000 plasma television, not pay for it at that moment and tell myself, hey, this plasma tv costs me nothing. It's the damn credit card bill. It's costing me a fortune. That's what we've done in healthcare. Um, and unfortunately we have divided the funding among so many different places, right? Ourselves. Um, our, uh, our employer in many cases, various targeted taxes, the government general revenues that people don't sit there and say, wow, the average middle class family is probably looking at 20, 30 percent of their income, somebody somewhere taking out and paying for healthcare. That's extraordinarily regressive. And I think if there's awareness of that or when there's awareness of that and it may take more time and more spending and more afraid, safety net and frankly more people suffering and being hurt, uh, for us to get the realization that there is no free ride in healthcare, it's costing us a fortune and we're all being hurt by the lack of discipline in the system.

Speaker 1:          18:10          I think only then you'll look at the true fundamental reform being politically possible for politicians to take the enormous political risk of saying to some of the interest groups in health care. I'm sorry, but the pie hasn't been. Again.
