Speaker 1:          00:11          The key issue when you're looking at cost cutting is to always plan for the future. Uh, the first set of, of, of questions ask yourself when you're doing cost cutting is, is relatively straight forward, which is, you know, can you use the, the necessity of cost cutting as an opportunity to do pruning a trimming for projects that aren't being as successful. Um, but you know, frequently though, those are the easy ones. I mean there's always some kind of social costs internal to the company, but, but that's the easy way of looking future. Then the more difficult is, is if you have to make decisions about resource allocations, about what you can apply to going to the future. And, uh, the algorithm or the, the thought analysis that you apply when you look at this kind of cost cutting tends to be okay, which of these things are most likely to return the company to a very strong position by which it can rigorously invest in its future. And so the projects that make it are the ones that you know, and those of course usually involve people and resources are the ones that you are investing in your future. And, and that's, that's the key algorithm. Look at him and, and, and whatever level of depth you need to do. You always looking to how do I rebuild this thing into the future?

Speaker 1:          01:22          Managing risk is a key variable for frankly all aspects of life businesses, just one of them. And one of the things that most people do in terms of managing risks, that's, that's, that's actually bad thinking is they think they can manage risk. Cause zero everything has some risks. You know, you drive your car down the street, drunk driver may hit you. So what you're doing is you're actually trying to get to an acceptable level of risk. Now in economic crisis times, the kinds of things you're looking at is it's generally harder to get capital a revenue growth. Maybe more revenue lines may be unstable or growth may be a less easy to predict that you're going to get to. And so, uh, what you do is you take a certain conservative approach of when, as all entrepreneurs should do you plan for both good luck and bad luck.

Speaker 1:          02:07          You put extra time on, okay, if I have bad luck, what do I do about that? And that doesn't mean that, for example, you, you planned that the bad luck of certainly going to happen, but you're ready to adjust your strategy, iterate, uh, interact and, and presume that you have bad luck. So in for example, a financing circumstance, what if financing is much more difficult to get the new thing? Do you have the contingent monitoring points and the contingent, uh, you know, I'm like, okay, here's what we can do in order to keep this company going and build it into the future. Even if financing is difficult, times of economic crisis can change what the competitive landscape looks like. Because when, for example, you have boom times capital's easy to come by, growth as easy. Sometimes what you focus on is how to accelerate in the boom during, uh, economic crises.

Speaker 1:          03:01          The question is the companies that come out of, you know, there are sailing through that with the, the best liquidity, both assets on the balance sheet, making money, ability to grow their businesses, get a disproportionate competitive advantage. So one of the really key things to look at in terms of, of crafting strategy when you're in an economic crisis is how do you maximize your look, your essentially your liquidity position and your ability to both take kind of profits and revenues and in business and then convert that into a stronger lead. And so those companies can do that, can, can actually, uh, you know, uh, get a march on the competitors.

Speaker 1:          03:43          The key thing for all businesses, and especially of course technology businesses or businesses that deploy technology as a key kind of strategic advantage is you always have to be investing in the future. Uh, technological change comes at accelerating rights. There are such things as, you know, Moore's law and that sort of thing. And that kind of bubbles up into kind of more feature sets and competitive ability. So the key thing is to invest in the future. And what that means is when you're deploying technology or you're a technology business is to make sure that you're keeping on the innovation cycle where you're, you're, you're both creating and adopting the new business practices and the new techniques in order to drive your business the right way. Now a really key thing in terms of doing that is staying in touch with the people in your network and in your industry to know what the benchmark is, to know what you should be doing in terms of, you know, what are the tools and techniques available and to be revving them as you go.

Speaker 1:          04:38          And that is, that is essential for B for maintaining a competitive edge and being successful if your business and kind of serious trouble, you have to make a decision about whether or not you have a Sufi. It's almost like on an investor or venture capitalist, the decision can you take the assets are my you are and get to a place where you're investing in the future. And if you're not, then you need to look for, you know, essentially, you know, how do you, how do you, how do you mass, how do you, how do you get the business to the place where it can invest in the future? One is sell the business. Another is getting strong financing and kind of reinvest in the business. The way of doing that, the key thing in any kind of guiding of the business is how do you create a strong organization that is kind of accelerating into the future. And when you're in trouble, the question is what are the techniques that you can, you know, Trim, refinance, soule, et Cetera in order to get this business back to that characteristic.

Speaker 1:          05:37          The CEO's job is always about leadership. It's about leadership on a vision in terms of where you're going. It's about making sure that people, that you have the regular organization and staff and that you have kind of clearly communicated what some of the plays are and what some of the goals are in terms of the business and how do you organize together in order to make that happen. So the key thing for a CEO to keep their head in the game is recognize that those turbulent times plan for, you know, bad luck as well as good luck. Uh, keep people, uh, focused on what the key business wins are and, you know, provide the energy that people always need in order to, you know, uh, you know, to go into battle because you know, work is hard and go into work and do that well and provide a good leadership. You can for that. In other words, it's the same thing that makes good leadership in any of that.
