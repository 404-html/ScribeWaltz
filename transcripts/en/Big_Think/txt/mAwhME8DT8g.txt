Speaker 1:          00:11          Growing, so I think you will see also India, because it's a young country, you know, more than 50 percent of the population is below the age of uh, 25. Uh, so I think you will see a more youthful culture, a more exuberant in many ways, a more matter of fact, uh, and this culture is contributing already and will contribute even more to the growth of housing. For example, young people buying homes. I think we'll have a lot more cars on the roads, a certainly a young population that is very gripped by technology changes and very open to everything that the digital age or offers. So I think we're going to see an India in which certainly divides will still be there. You will see young urban Indians, very tech savvy, very connected to the urban cultures. You will still have people living in our villages in very traditional ways as they do today. And I think that they will continue at least for the next 10, 15, 20 years. And, uh, so we, uh, will be, I think at a different level, but as we joke in India about how we live in all the ages,
