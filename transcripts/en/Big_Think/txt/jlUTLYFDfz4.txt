Speaker 1:          00:08          In Israel, just to give a general explanation in Israel, we have, according to the law, we have to give everything that's rewrite about military and intelligence issues to the military censorship. This book was submitted to military censorship when it came back, I counted 750 deletions, a and a tedious negotiation started with them and we submitted some appears to supreme court in most cases. One of them is the case of an in Israeli businessman ex officer with the idea of a hero of the Yom Kippor, October 72, the war who became a businessman and cynically crudely and viciously sold chemical warfare to Iran. The fact that this was not caught by Mozart in time and the whole affair a were banned by military censorship. I appeal to Supreme Court and won. And there's a chapter in a book called the termite file because the whole operation was called him the termite, uh, describing the operation.

Speaker 1:          01:15          In some cases we reach compromise. One of them was very funny. I think there was. There's a, there's a chapter called the second coming of Hezbollah that starts with an interview with a prominent figure dealing with his Bible in which he says in 50 years when they opened the secret files, people in Israel would be amazed to how poor was the human penetration of Israeli intelligence into Hezbollah. When, when people would read the secret files that would be shocked and sad to see that Masada looked far less, eh, like James Bond and far more like inspector clouseau. And then he asked me, do you know how many real agent did Israel have in the ranks of Hisbala? Like true ranks, not in the sympathizers. Nordion outside circles his troops, and he left some fingers of his right arm. Now military censorship took everything out. We appealed against it and the outcome was a compromise in which they permitted to publish everything.

Speaker 1:          02:24          And it's in the book, except for the exact number of fingers that he lifted. So if you read it, you'll see that it's somewhere between one and five because it's only his right arm and fingers were chopped in previous operations. Uh, but there's no exact number. I think it's ridiculous, but yet we had to reach some sort of a compromise. I would say this, the bottom line is the 95 percent of this book is new information and I think that after all the knowledge of the reader of what's going on in that clandestine war between Israel and the United States and one hand in Iran was not severely damaged by this. Of.
