Speaker 1:          00:01          My contributions just to, you know, look at new technology products that come along, pick out what I do,

Speaker 2:          00:13          I think are the most interesting ones. And try to tell a fairly large group of readers whether I think they're worth buying. I don't want to overinflate it. That's what I do. The other thing I do is I explain some of these technologies. Some of my comms are not product reviews, but they are,

Speaker 1:          00:29          uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:31          planers about technology. And then I, a few times a year I do comms where I take on broader issues like I, you know, attack the, what I consider to be the excessive control of the phone, wireless phone companies, and I'll take them on. And that gets me to be kind of controversial for a few weeks, you know.

Speaker 1:          00:50          Oh. Um, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:52          but that's my role. I wouldn't,

Speaker 1:          00:55          I wouldn't, uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:57          you know, inflated. I'm a, I'm a journalist. I'm a reviewer.

Speaker 1:          01:01          Uh, I have, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:05          thankfully I'm grateful for it. I have a good, large following. And so, uh, uh, I just help people sort through the, uh, the thicket of these technology options they have. But I don't invent technology. I don't create technology

Speaker 1:          01:21          and I don't, uh, uh, you know, monetize technology. I write about it. Well, I'm not going to, cause I'm not going to buy into the idea that I could make and break

Speaker 2:          01:36          people. Obviously the Wall Street Journal is widely read our websites and I'm now all, I'm now on many different websites, syndicated, uh, uh, I'm running my own with a partner, Kara swisher website called the all things d. Dot com. So I obviously, because I have a lot of readers, if I say this product is really good, it helps them. If I say it's really bad, it hurts them. But that's different than saying you can make and break products. I'm also not going to say I'm central to the development. I've never invented anything except a co, a column and a conference. I've never been in any tech products. But I think if you're asking me why have I developed a following and been able to retain a following, which I do admit I have done, I think it's because, uh, I've stayed true to the mission that I proposed 16 years ago. I don't, I don't mean to be goofy about it, but uh, but sometimes the simple principles are what works and I've just been laser focused on,

Speaker 1:          02:43          okay,

Speaker 2:          02:43          a very specific but large audience, which is non techies. People who don't want to be techies, people who have better things to do with their time than tweaking these digital devices. They want them to work, they want to enjoy them, they want to use them. They're not afraid of them. They're not new to them. They could be any age. I mean, you know, if you're 16 and you have a lot of time on your hands, you may want to screw around with trying to fix your windows when it breaks. If you're the same person in your 25 and you still are not afraid of the computer and you have a lot of technical knowledge, you suddenly find you have a lot less time on your hands to goof around with it. And so it isn't a question of being dumb or smart or, or intimidated or not intimidated.

Speaker 2:          03:34          It's a question of you bought, you bought the laptop. When you open it up, you expect it to come on, you expect it to connect to the Wifi network, you expect it to get you to the website, you expect it to deal with your email, expect to be able to play, you know, uh, your favorite game on it. You expect to be able to, uh, deal. We'll do facebook and my space and at the same time, if you want to or need to, you expect to be, uh, uh, you know, write a 50 page paper on it. That's what they promise you when they sell you the computer and they don't promise you that you're going to be spending your time dealing with defragging, the hard drive and you know, updating the security program and all that other stuff. And so I have been laser focused on that. The first line of my first column was personal computers are just too hard to use and it's not your fault. And I still think that's true and I think, uh, it's true for a cell phones, which are like personal computers 10 years ago. It's true for, um, most of these products. So, uh, I think that's why I still have a following. I mean, I'm in widely read print and web and broadcast outlets, but I also constantly have adopted that voice.
