Speaker 1:          00:03          I think, uh, the great driver of all of these participatory changes is the choice by individuals to be active instead of passive. Uh, we fed ourselves on a notion that humans were office drones at work and couch potatoes at home and it was just kind of shuttling back and forth from one to the other and then when the opportunity to participate came about even in know, even in relatively small ways, right. I, I'm going to be sharing photos of this thing or I'm, you know, I wrote a poem and I'm going to put it up on my blog and maybe only three people read it, but that's more than none a that, that almost all of that is personal drive, right? That's the big, that's the big producer of the change. And the individual participants are the beneficiaries, right? The, the, the, the choice to be active benefits.

Speaker 1:          00:55          The person who makes that choice, uh, the, the beneficiaries dance stream of that is, I, you know, as, as we talked about earlier, a really depends on what kind of sharing is being done. So if I make a new law cat run, I find the cutest picture ever and I give it the funniest caption ever. It makes some people laugh, right? You can't claim a big social benefit there. Um, if at the other extreme I'm at patients like me and I'm trying to change a, I'm trying to change medical research culture, I might get a disease, uh, understood and a cure developed faster and that benefits not only everyone who has the disease at benefit society as a whole for having fewer resources go into, go into treatment of, of, of whatever disease. It is a, there's a lot of work recently on als. And so once you get past an individual who chooses to be active getting benefits for themselves, you really have to look at what the participation is doing to see who benefits, but the range of benefits that are possible from harnessing this cognitive surplus is quite extraordinary.

Speaker 1:          02:07          I say it's bad when it becomes addictive, right? And there's a big, there's a big discussion about, uh, whether or not the word addiction is an appropriate inappropriate words, large. A large clinical conversation about Internet addiction, et Al, but I will tell you that in the early nineties I felt it. I used the word addict to describe myself in a completely, in a completely unironically. I was addicted to something called Usenet, which is the global set of both boards. And I had to addicts, classic pathology, which is that I needed to, to be on using it every day. Not because it made me happy, but after a while because if I didn't do it, it made me feel bad. Right. Which is the, you know, and our, I remember literally, I remember the morning where I woke up and I did not need to check my email and I thought, oh, it was as if a fever had broke.

Speaker 1:          03:04          Uh, the, the deeply wired pleasures of social interaction coupled with the kind of mediated space we live in a can create a can create these kinds of addictions and people, whether it's updating their, updating their profile page on a social network or it's playing a game or what have you. And it can lead people to do many of the things that the pathology of addiction does, which is to cut themselves off from their friends, to neglect their social life, neglect their schoolwork, neglect their work and so forth. And those are the kinds of things that society has always grappled with, right? It's, you know, it's the problem around a gambler's anonymous, right where it's, it's not that you're injecting a chemical into your body, not like alcoholism or, or, or cocaine or what have you, but it is, it is an activity that's changing the, you know, that it's giving you the endorphin rush or giving you the chemical, a chemical consistency like in your brain.

Speaker 1:          04:05          And as with gambling, there are kinds of activities that can become addicting. Uh, my, my personal guess, although I am not a clinician, my personal guess is that Internet addiction and even more than the Internet addiction, particular classes of addiction, social gaming addiction, social network addiction, so forth are going to be understood better in the next five years. They'll turn out to be much rarer than the hand wringing in the press would currently. We currently have you believe where everyone who uses facebook is a, is an addict or a punitive addict, but they will be a nontrivial number of cases where people are genuinely addicted. And I think as a society will then have to find ways, uh, to convince those people to help them out of that addiction. In the same way we have done with gambling is gambling and spread outside of Vegas to include most of the country.
