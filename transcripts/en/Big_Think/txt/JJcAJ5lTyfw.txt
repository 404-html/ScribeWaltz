Speaker 1:          00:07          Well, Richard Dawkins is very good at, at framing science for his audience. So as an in writing popular science book books for a worldwide audience of people who already have a strong interest in science, he's been a great translator. He's discovered the metaphors, he's discovered. Uh, the stories, the examples that really unlock complexity for his popular science audience get, gets them to understand better the complexity of evolutionary science when he's now moved into being an atheist leader. He's very good. And the God delusion at writing for an audience of atheists, people already critical religion or people who are questioning and what he does a much like bill o'reilly might do on the O'reilly factor, he provides talking points and simplifies the arguments against religion. Um, and connecting how science might be used as a way to argue against religion. And people come away from that book with their preexisting opinions intensified and also with a lot of talking points to express their opinion.

Speaker 1:          01:13          So in, in fact, he's a social movement leader now he's mobilized, he's intensified a movement that's critical of religion. But when you move then from his natural audience out into kind of the swing public people who appreciate science but also all maybe moderate real religious, they attend church. They have friends and family who are religious. They probably lack the motivation and the interest to actually buy his book. But they do see Time magazine covers that say science versus God. Or they might catch a snippet of one of the soundbites where he compares religion to child abuse or religion to fairies are hobgoblins and he becomes then the bay. They're very leading example for Christian fundamentalist to say, Hey, everything we've told you about science and religion being conflict. Here's Richard Dawkins is leading theorists about evolution. He saying exactly what we've told you is always been always been true is that getting evolution in schools is really a way to undermine religion. Richard Dawkins actually says, if you learn about evolution, you're probably going to be less religious or evolutionary sciences in direct conflict with religion. Um, and, and so in that case, uh, he can be a polarizing figure. Uh, he could actually be used by the other side to undermine the teaching evolution in schools, at least in the United States.

Speaker 1:          02:33          The strongest objections are from what I call it, the Richard Dawkins School of Communication. Uh, many of these people are out there in the blogosphere. They feel very intensely about the connection between science and religion. Uh, they take the viewpoint that a science undermines the validity of any religious belief, uh, in fact even respect for religion. And so their, their reaction is that, um, to say that science and religion are not in conflict, uh, to, to present evolutionary science in any way other than just talking about the facts of the science is not being true to the science. It's been, it's dishonest. Um, I've been, uh, called at Neville Chamberlain Atheist Because, um, I'm an appeaser of, of, of, uh, an appeaser and an enabler of people who really believe in a religion or in God. Um, on the other hand, other scientists have the concern that this might just translate into spin.

Speaker 1:          03:26          Um, and that's something that a science institutions should always be careful about. And that's why we always insist when talking about climate change, when talking about evolutionary science, when you package that information in a way that connects to a non traditional public, a non science audience, you always have to remain true to the science and in stem cell research, that's a great example. In some cases where the reframing of that issue around social progress, the ability to lead to cures and therapies has gone beyond the state of the science. The uncertainty with therapies can be available. Oftentimes this has been promoted by politicians such as John Edwards, who in 2004 said if John Kerry is elected president, he was campaigning for Carrie, for vice president. Um, Christopher Reeve would get up out of a wheelchair and walk again. Of course this goes well beyond any type of timeline therapy we might have available in the foreseeable future. And that's an example where you can go beyond the science. And when you do that, you risk public trust. So you always have to be careful. But certainly no one would ever suggest that Eo Wilson and writing the creation, growing the audience for science by connecting it to, um, religious values or the national academies and doing audience research as a way to communicate evolution. No one ever suggest that Eo Wilson of the National Academies are spinning the Science. They're being untruthful about the science
