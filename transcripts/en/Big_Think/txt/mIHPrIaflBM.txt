Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:08          it might be the greatest task facing, say the next American president on the foreign policy realm is to reestablish the moral authority of the United States as a human rights actor. Now, I don't want to overstate the case that the US does still have an important voice say to stop genocide. Um, the US has actually been an important rhetorical voice under four because the United States does not commit mass murder. It's not, you know, ethnically cleansing hundreds of thousands of people. So in that sense, there is still some residual moral authority to the United States. The US can also credibly promote democracy because, you know, whatever flaws we have in the United States, it still is a credible democracy, but the US cannot, with a straight face promote the fight against torture, fight against foreseeable disappearance, the fight against arbitrary detention and the fight against unfair trials because these are all abuses that the Bush administration is practiced in the name of fighting terrorism.

Speaker 2:          01:07          So the real challenge facing a new government is to end those practices, to repudiate them, to hold the author's accountable in some meaningful way. And to recommit the United States to serious respect for human rights, even in the tough moments, even when the US is at threat. And in doing that, I think that the United States can reclaim its position as one of the leaders, if not the leader of the human rights movement at the governmental level. That is absolutely essential. I think in the longterm, if the human rights movement is to have the power that is enjoyed in an earlier era.
