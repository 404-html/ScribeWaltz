Speaker 1:          00:05          My name is Sherman Alexie and on the bantamweight champion of the world. Uh, no, I'm a writer, poet, short story writer, novelist, screenwriter. You're young bastard. I'm doing okay. Uh, uh, it is a strange dilemma because in some sense, you know, I was very negative, very native identified and I still am, but that's almost become secondary. I've sort of joined the tribe of highly established literary writers. So, you know, I'm with Jonathan Franzen's of the world. Uh, you know, we, I know I'm a little bit, but that's sort of my peer group now rather than this sort of, you know, Indian world literary world. I'm now in this sort of

Speaker 1:          00:51          make believe world of writers who supposedly hang out a lot, although none of us ever do. So I'm in, I'm in a community of riders, highly successful literary writer is now. Oh, it's all. I mean, I haven't changed anything I've written based on all that stuff. So the perceptions of me may have changed or the my career, but I'm still writing the same stuff. It's still pretty much about spokane, Indian males stumbling through live. So, uh, I think it's because of the combination of skills I have, you know, I work in multigenre is, um, you know, I do stand up comedy. I helped make movies. I think all of that has contributed to it. I'm not just a novelist or not just a short story writer. So I think, uh, in this highly technological world with many diverse and diffuse influences, I think I'm able to hit a lot of bases. Nobody who's ever been poor, whatever, use the phrase selling out, uh, uh,

Speaker 2:          01:55          wow.

Speaker 1:          01:56          You know, you know, my influences and the genre artists come from my Indian writing ancestors, the previous generation when you're talking James Welch, Simon Artese, Scott Momaday, joy Harjo, Leslie Silko, Linda Hogan, Adrian St Louis, all of these writers were multigenre. They all wrote poetry and novels and short stories and nonfiction and dabbled in song writing and filmmaking and documentary making. So my original influences were native American multigenre artists. Uh, now these days the younger native writers are not multigenre. So it's very interesting. I'm not sure what's happening, why that has changed, but I grew up as a kid writer. Uh, nobody ever told me I was supposed to be one thing, so just because I've happened to become successful in a number of those genres, it wasn't because I was pursuing them economically, it was because I saw the artistic possibilities in all of it. And I was taught that was when I was a 19 year old undergraduate.

Speaker 1:          03:00          Yeah. I think I'm the least educated Indian writer out there. Uh, yeah, I've been, I've taught at the University of Washington, so, but I'm not a good teacher. So I think that probably disqualifies me. Uh, yeah. I'm not in academia at all. Uh, in terms of a full time career. Uh, I think it's interesting because I think when you look at native American literature, you're going to find that it doesn't really reflect the diversity of the ways in which the writers actually live their lives. Nobody has ever written, for instance, in academic farce, a native American teacher at college forest, which is a time honored and wonderful genre. You know, David Lodge made a whole career out of it, writing economic forces. And I, you know, every, every writer you can name as written it, but we haven't done it, uh, you know, whereas that novel about that Indian architect or that Indian lawyer, uh, there's a distinct lack of white collar, native American literature, despite the fact that most of it's most visible practitioners are white collar themselves. So, uh, I think there's an effort, a somewhat of an insecurity that to prove your indianness by focusing almost entirely on our reservation based identity.

Speaker 1:          04:19          I think it's old fashioned actually, you know, I think people think it's something new. But the idea of being a storyteller, you know, for most of our existence was not related to books. It was about the ability to stand up in front of the fire and, you know, earn your supper. Uh, so I think it's just something old and inspired in me, but I never really was the funny guy growing up. If you'd asked my siblings, they tell you I was the depressed guy in the basement. But, uh, there the funny ones, but, uh, it just, I got on stage and started talking and people laughed at the beginning. I didn't even necessarily know what was happening, uh, but as the years have gone on, I realized that a humorous, pretty amazing in its ability to transcend differences politically, ethnically, racially, geographically, economically. Uh, there's something about it that really opens people up spiritually, I think.

Speaker 1:          05:13          And they listen. They pay attention and it's also a great way to offend people. Uh, I don't know. We've all been to literary readings, you know, where we got theater but so bored by the person up in front of us reading their work so dispassionately that it nearly turns us off their books. Uh, you know, there are writers who I've heard do their work that I could only hear their voice when I'm reading their books and it's so disinterested in their own stuff and I just never wanted to do that. Uh, I wanted to make the mistake the other way, you know, I'm pleased when somebody is offended by my large stage presence because there's still people who show up will get offended. Uh, I get up there and give a show and I'm improvising and, you know, talking about current events and what happened yesterday or what happened an hour ago, what happened five minutes before I walked into the place, you know, and giving people a glimpse of how my, you know, crazy mind works and then they'll come up after me and said, well, I'm really disappointed you didn't read the story.

Speaker 1:          06:17          And, and you look at them and think, well, you can read this story. You know, what happened tonight will only happen once, you know, you were here for one time thing. Uh, so I guess people are trapped in their perceptions of what a literary artist is supposed to be.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Uh, you know, I write poems naturally. I'm writing them all the time. I think it's more of a reflex talent than fiction is for me. It seems like I have to work harder to write fiction. Uh, that sad poems are much more demanding. You have fewer words, you can make fewer mistakes. And if you write a 10 line poem, you really can't make any mistakes. If you do, the poem is terrible. You know, when you write a novel, you have all that space to mess up in and people are more forgiving. So, uh, I think poetry audiences are far more demanding than fiction and audiences are well, you know, writers generally come in two groups, those who love what they do and those who can't stand what they do. Um, in the second group, I have a really difficult time looking back. Uh, yeah. So I figure out of the thousands of pages I published, there's probably about 100 great pages.

Speaker 1:          07:31          I think I worked on probably about a two percent greatness rate. Uh, so there's probably 10 poems to stories that are great and the rest of it is from anywhere from pretty good to know total crap, you know, the book is not played out. The idea of what a book can be is not played out in its form as it is with paper and covers and um, and there are things that can be, that digital will never touch. And that's one of the things I wanted to do with this, uh, and comparing it to a cassette tape, the old fashioned way of making a mix tape, which, you know, I love burning cds too, but there is something far more passionate and hands on and hard work about making a mix tape on a cassette. A, it's too easy to revise with a CD. And today's technology makes it too easy to, to, to change immediately. You can cover your mistakes quicker. I, I think, uh, I think it allows you to have this sheen of perfection around yourself, uh, and with, uh, an old fashioned book or an old fashioned cassette tape, you can actually see all the flaws and imperfections and the bad choices. Uh, and I think there's something we lose with technology when you talk about bad choices.

Speaker 1:          08:56          They cost $300. Number one, I don't think anything that costs $300 can be called the gala perion. Uh, you know, how much of the world can afford a $300 reading device? A one percent of one percent of one percent that automatically qualifies for economically elite status. Uh, but what, what, what's really going on here, the reading public doesn't really know about all they're concerned about and all their defending is they're reading convenience, which I completely understand whether it's because of physical disability or because of personal preference or just the newness of it, why they love a digital book, but they don't understand the economic corporate pressures going on in the publishing world and what's going to happen. And this is going to happen on the Internet to, uh, we like to pretend that the internet is free. Uh, you know, we like to pretend it's an open source culture.

Speaker 1:          09:45          But as culture changes, as corporate, old corporate models of distributing information are changing, you know, I don't know why people assumed that corporations aren't going to take over this medium as well because they can. And, and, uh, uh, so what's happening in the book world, the digital books, is that these ebook companies, you know, Amazon, Barnes and noble, others that are rising a, they just don't seek to published books. They're going to end up seeking the books to be chosen to be published. So, uh, this economic model, the way it's set up now is going to favor a certain kind of book a and publishers and being economically motivated companies are only going to be publishing those kinds of books and the divide between pop culture, pop writing and literary writing. Is this going to increase and increase and increase and it's gonna make it harder and harder and harder for first time writers to get published in any form whatsoever where they'll get attention, who can find you, uh, who, who's gonna find anybody.

Speaker 1:          10:55          Nobody's really risen out of the Internet to become a major voice. Uh, they always end up getting a book published and then the book makes them a major voice. Uh, but nobody has. I mean, uh, I'm trying to think, uh, you know, I'm not Internet averse at all. I'm doing this, uh, I mean I love the Internet, but the fact is, is that it's a giant, giant, unfiltered library which has the strength and beauty, but, but it's impossible to find people and you know, what we end up doing anyways, I go to about five sites, uh, you know, and I think most people probably do the same thing. You create this little small town inside the Internet and we end up in all these little tiny separate communities. Uh, Joan Jett and interviewed Joan Jett, she said about the music industry. She said, the thing that's missing now is anticipation.

Speaker 1:          11:46          They said that nobody gets an a big line outside of tower records anymore waiting for that new stones album to drop. And nobody stands in line outside of a record store waiting to buy the tickets for the WHO concert. Uh, there's a real lack of community on the internet experience when it comes to art and you can't tell me and it's not true that communicating strictly through the Internet forums community and the way that being together does a, you're missing all. But one sense you don't smell paypal, you don't really hear them, you don't see him. Uh, and we're animals. We're creatures of senses and the Internet deprives you of many of those. And, and, uh, so, uh, I, I know there's new art coming based on this technology and some of it's happening and it's exciting and interesting, but there's nothing wrong with the old art and I always worry and you see it with certain Internet folks, the way in which they're completely willing to jettison their past in the pursuit of something new. And that's what I'm worried about.

Speaker 1:          12:52          Well, in order to write about the emotional state of a character, I have to get as close as possible to being in that emotional state. So I have to get that sad. I have to get that happy, that crazed, that bizarre, that obsessed, you know, whatever one of my characters are going through, I have to find my way into it. Uh, you know, it's just, it's just the way I do it. There's a story in this book called the Ballad of Paul nonetheless, where he becomes so obsessed with pop music and so obsessed with his ipod and that he, he, he, you know, every thought he has, this can become directly related to a song. So I went that far into it. I, I tried to talk only in song lyrics. Uh, you know, whenever anybody was talking to me, I drove my friends and family mad because whenever they would talk to me, you know, I would say, well, that reminds me of this, you know, a rolling stones song or, or whenever anybody said something accidentally that was a lyric or a title of a song, I would then sing the song.

Speaker 1:          13:54          So it was crazy. But it got me seeing the way it was completely alienating. My friends and family really got me to a place where I could write that story about this really genial guy who's actually very much an anti hero, a case of beer a day. Uh, you know, I could drink a fifth of Tequila a day. Uh, you know, it becomes a drinking problem when it affects your relationships with people, uh, when it affects your job or your school, your grade point average, uh, uh, you know, affects your, it's a drinking problem when you're sitting on your couch at home, drinking a case of beer all by yourself and then you pass out and grabbed the fifth of Tequila when you wake up. So it's pretty obvious what my problem was.

Speaker 1:          14:47          I wrote the lone ranger and Tonto fistfight in heaven and the business of fancy dancing a while drunk and drinking. So, uh, there's, uh, there's certainly a lot to be said for my desperate years. My Alcoholic Year is my active alcoholic years as being the source of some pretty good work, uh, for being the source of the two books that established and made my career. Uh, but the thing is, it's unsustainable. Uh, you know, if you are using substances to feel your creativity, uh, you're going to have a very, very short artistic life. You're going to be a sprinter. And, and, uh, by and large I wanted to become a marathon runner and I can only run the marathon if I'm sober. You Kill Your brain, uh, you know, please try to find me the successful drug user, you know, you know, try to find me the high functioning alcoholic, you know, career person, and, and you could probably find in their work when they were drinking, when they were a, I bet you could look at the downfall of some amazing writers who wrote a one or two great books and then just fell apart.

Speaker 1:          15:58          I'm pretty sure that's a related to alcohol consumption. So it's unsustainable. Uh, you know, it's sort of like the environment, uh, you can only pour so much pollutants into it before the temperature changes dramatically. So I think a drug and alcohol abuse is like the greenhouse effect for riders.

Speaker 1:          16:20          Well, I mean, I'm an alcoholic. That's, you know, my family is filled with alcohol alcoholics. My tribe is filled with alcoholics. The whole race is filled with alcoholics. It's a, for those Indians who try to pretend it's a stereotype, they're in deep, deep denial. Uh, it's an everyday part of my life and as a writer I use that a to write about it, you know, partly for fictional purposes and narrative purposes, but partly what the social hope that by writing about it, maybe it'll help people get sober and it has, I've heard from them, uh, you know, the social function of art is very important to me. Uh, it's not just for art's sake. Uh, I have a very specific, very specific ideas in mind about what it can do. I've seen it happen. So it is writing about alcohol that helps me stay sober. Uh, and I think reading about alcoholism helps other people stay sober.

Speaker 1:          17:17          I try to meet deadlines I have, I have, you know, more dependence. Uh, so it's a very, very, uh, basic triangle needs that bottom part of the triangle. But, uh, well they're always surprising me. The kids are, I surprisingly, if their insights into the world and of course because they're my children, I pay more attention to what they're saying. Then pretty much everybody else on the planet. I care more what my kids say on a daily basis. Then, you know, the smartest people on the planet, you know, and so I listened and their insights are really surprising and the way in which, how unfiltered they are and, and, uh, their obsessions and passions, they don't apologize for any of that. So I learned a lot from them. You know, it's also aggravating and irritating and exhausting, uh, the sacrifices you make and you know, you know, sometimes it feels like my whole life as a to do list. Uh, but, but, uh, you know, I think their passion for life really as reinspired me.

Speaker 1:          18:24          No I don't, I mean they're, they're, they're autonomous. I certainly, if they want to read my stuff and talk about it later, that'll be great. But until then, uh, it was so funny though. I was profiled on the layer news hour recently and I was watching the rough cut of it and my son came down, my eight year old and he was watching it on the TV with me and it was a five minute piece about poetry and I read a couple poems and I read one very emotional, one of my father's death and it was over and my son looked at me. He's eight years old. They looked at me. He goes, Dad, you're pretty good.

Speaker 1:          19:00          So that was a great moment. It's funny. This popped into my head, so I'll go with it. Shoeless Joe Jackson, uh, who was banned from baseball in 1919 for allegedly fixing the world series a country boy ended up being a great baseball player, one of the greatest of all time. I'd like to talk to them about that world series about the mysteries of human nature because, you know, you're looking at the stats. It's, I'm pretty sure he didn't participate in the fixed, but he knew about it. So I'd like to have the discussion with morality, which she will list Joe Jackson. Well, there are just certain poems and novels and stories that resonate forever and ever, uh, you know, poems. I always return to Emily Dickinson because I could not stop for death that kindly stopped for me.

Speaker 3:          19:52          Uh, no

Speaker 1:          19:54          theater, Rhett keys. I know a woman, you know, I knew a woman, lovely later bones when small birds side

Speaker 3:          20:00          back at them,

Speaker 1:          20:04          James, right? Suddenly I realized that if I stepped outside my body, I would break into blossom. So, uh, and then, you know, I can, you know, the end of Grapes of Wrath when Rosa, Sharon breastfeeds, her child has died, but she breastfeeds to starving man. That moment. Uh, so it's always individual works. Uh, even in life I don't, I don't have heroes, I believe in heroic ideas because the creators of all those ideas are very human. And if you make heroes out of people, you invariably be disappointed as her Jack Keats a snowy day. The book, you know, the idea of multicultural literature is very new. And so as a little Indian boy growing up on the reservation, there was nobody like me in the books. So you always had to extrapolate. But when I picked up a snowy day with that inner city Black Kid, that child walking through the snow covered pretty quiet and lonely city. Oh, I mean, when he was making snow angels and you know, when he was getting a snowball fights and when he got home to his mother and it was cold, and if you put them in a hot bath tub and put them to sleep, the loneliness and the love in that book. Oh, just gorgeous. So that picture book resonates with me still.
