Speaker 1:          00:09          You have a number of, of, of success stories in, in Africa in the last 15 to 20 years. A country like Ghana has a huge substantial growth rates. Uh, there's some countries in, in, in, in cells in Africa who are also doing quite well in Asia. I was in Bangladesh for a couple of weeks ago and that's the country facing enormous challenges. Uh, but there's 150 million people living in a country, something twice the size of Ireland. I don't know what the appropriate level of state and the United States is, but it's, it's, it's a small piece of land and, uh, you know, they've been growing against all the odds and surviving. There's still huge poverty, but they're still making some progress. And obviously, as are some other cases in, particularly in Asia, places like Cambodia who have came out of a dreadful, a internal conflict 30, 30 odd years ago and have made a lot of progress.

Speaker 1:          01:06          So I think the foundation stones have to be good governance. I think countries have to invest in education, uh, obviously, uh, set and get, find some way of partnership between governments and civil society and governments I think have to be willing to give the space to civil society to enable them to make the cost contribution and enable at over time institutional development for that governmental and nongovernmental level to develop an, and, and that is ultimately, I think what needs to be done in, in, in, uh, in a country. And obviously good, well grounded policy policy is important. I mean, policy that we'll, uh, we'll put attend if in a country, for example, uh, that has a big proportion of its economy dealing in agriculture. There has to be a, you know, uh, do focus on that. And I think the food crisis earlier this year brought it home to people that for the last 20 to 30 years, agriculture and rural development as a sector has largely been neglected. And there is a daunting at, at, on leaders both at national and international level, that that has to change.
