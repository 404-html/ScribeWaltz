Speaker 1:          00:08          Well, I, I can probably say the most about healthcare because that's an area where, um, uh, again, a devoted in approximately last five or six years, it really intensively to kind of try to understand the puzzle of how healthcare, um, and healthcare, I think we have every opportunity to truly transform, uh, the value of patient in healthcare if we actually are able to go back and step back from the incremental changes to what we have today and ask ourselves what would it take for us to create a dramatically higher value system. So again, I've, I've written a lot, a lot about this lately and, and, and, and talk about it incessantly now, but, but you know, things like, you know, just how you organize care, uh, uh, things like how you measure success. Uh, these things are very, very simple, but you know, our best guests, uh, uh, is that we could get double the value from the amount of money we're spending today or we could get pretty much the same value for half the money were. I mean, that's the order of magnitude of the transformation. And I'm very optimistic about healthcare because I now see enough grassroots bottom up effort and enough belief in the basic framework of that, that value is how we, how we need to think and, and, and the patient's perspective is what we should care about. That I, yeah, I can, I can see a line of sight to, to a, a healthcare system that will be very proud of and it'll, it'll lead the world and, and it'll be affordable.
