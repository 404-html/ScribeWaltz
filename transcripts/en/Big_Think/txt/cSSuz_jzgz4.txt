Speaker 1:          00:09          It's always useful journalistically to remember the kind of sine curve of a defeat in victory. I remember I've just a couple of months ago, we ran a cover, um, that had, uh, three, four panels and Obama in three of them is walking across water in radiant light, like, you know, the great biblical figure. And in the fourth panel, he falls in the water. This was at the nadir of the healthcare debate. It looked like he was quite possibly going to lose. There was already talk about how horrible November, uh, elections were going to be for the Democratic Party. And then he turns it around and he won. He didn't win a bipartisan victory by any means. In fact, the main politicking had to be within the Democratic Party to put, put it over. But all that said, he wanted an enormous victory and the momentum of the presidency changed. How long that'll last. Will it have any bearing on what happens in November? We'll, as those reports always say, we'll wait and see.

Speaker 1:          01:11          Even though that Obama's political reflex is political personality, uh, aims toward conciliation. It's certainly what made him a political animal is early as Harvard law school. It's how he got to be the president of the law review by drawing in conservatives as well as liberals, is how he's succeeded. He's not a fool. He sees reality. He sees the, the par partisan divisiveness in the congress. He wants to win. This is not some kind of pie eyed idealist look at the healthcare bill. That bill can tracked it and it was shaped over time in ways he may not have wanted, but he wanted to win. He did not want to walk out of there a gallant loser. Um, conciliation is also not a strategy that will necessarily work with a pretty stubborn international forces. Conciliation is not a necessarily a, um, uh, or charm is not something that's going to work with Mukmood, Almadina, Jod, uh, or any other, uh, you know, any other political force of that. Like, um, there's also a toughness to him. It's not toughness that's obstreperous and, and a swaggering, but he's capable of it.
