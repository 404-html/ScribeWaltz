Speaker 1:          00:02          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:09          part of it is blind luck taught us. Everything is blind luck, you know, really just rewind everything we've said this interview and you can add blind luck. Certainly in my career I've been incredibly lucky that we say I was, I wasn't as good as spin made me look. It wasn't as bad as gear made me look when it failed. Uh, I had a lot of great luck would spin as well as some good hard work and some good instincts. So, um, you know, I think luck is important even in creativity because people walk in the door and if they like it, they call their friends and they walk in the door, you know, sometimes you meet somebody randomly and you say, why don't you try writing for me? Or how would you like to be a photographer for me? You know? And it happens. The environment though to sustain the, the atmosphere of creativity is you have to have the balls to risk doing something edgy and having it failed.

Speaker 2:          01:06          I used to say, oh, my photographers who came to work for me, you know, I said, I love your portfolio. Take pictures that you would put in your portfolio. Do not give me middle of the road average photography that you think is safe, so I'll hire you. Again. I'm telling you, you got three assignments. I don't care if the first two are crap. You still get a third. So in that confidence, come out and take your pictures because that's the voice I want in the magazine. I say to my right, it's the same thing. Don't get me a safe middle of the road piece. Give me an edge. Eps. Find the truth. The truth may not be pleasant. We'll publish it either way, if it's true, but go out there in the conference. I'm still going to hire you unless you steal from us, then I'm not going to argue and that happened.

Speaker 2:          01:47          But you know, basically one has to foster confidence amongst one's creative people. There's nobody less creative, less confident in the creative field. And I say that myself is when I'm writing, let's conference anybody on the planet, I'm sure. Um, but you must foster confidence. People must feel they can actually go and be artists for you. Now, a lot of editors and publishers don't want artistry. They want straightforward industrial produce a product as to fill the space. Don't upset your advertise. A complaint I have about Conde Nast is that they are more concerned about not upsetting their advertisers than they are about delivering a gps. Yeah. Then we fear will deliver great pieces and so when New York had those two exceptions, but you have to foster confidence that people can go out and actually reached the brass ring in each assignment and then you get critical and that begets other creators.
