Speaker 1:          00:09          Do you need to think strategically about how you're going to organize, manage, and lead the enterprise to enable, uh, and adaptive, resilient, uh, organization with high commitment and the capacity to innovate and Change Michael Beer, professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and Chairman of true point leaders of these or of these organizations have made and those who aspire to, to build these firms need to make a number of critical choices. The first and foremost choice is about what is the purpose of the organization. Uh, is it to increase shareholder wealth and stop there? Or is it more than that? Most high commitment, high performance with high commitment, high performance organizations have a multistakeholder perspective. They see their task as achieving profitability. That's very important. It's essential for survival. It's essential for, uh, for satisfying one of their critical constituencies, the investor, uh, but they also aspire to, uh, to create commitment, not only investors, but in customers and employees, importantly and employees, and in the, and, and to, and to be concerned about the community and society as, as a, as a whole.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Uh, and, uh, so the choice of purpose and the choice of, of, of, of values that reflect that multi stakeholder perspective is an, is an essential first step, uh, in the development of affirm. Uh, without that philosophy. Without that viewpoint, uh, you can get human resource departments to do all kinds of things with policies and practices, you will not succeed. Uh, the second important choice they make is about strategy. A high commitment, high performance organizations are characterized by an increment, illogical incrementalism as uh, as a, uh, one of my one researcher once called it logical incrementalism in their strategic evolution over time. Uh, they don't, uh, they don't strike out into areas that they are not, they have any capabilities. Then they stretched their capabilities, they develop their capabilities and they move into adjacent areas and grow that way off core capabilities. Uli Packard again would be a great example.

Speaker 1:          02:34          Uh, a core technology and test and measurement led them to improve things for the customer that led them to begin to develop computer computer capabilities were, uh, information processing capabilities because that was part of building better, better tested measurement organizations. And then they began to apply those same ideas in a newer of a ways into both the computer business, the server, and ultimately, and, and in the printing business, which was an offshoot of, of, of the soda, that whole approach. Uh, so an incremental, logical, incremental ism in their strategy. A strategy that both puts emphasis on exploitation and on exploration. One of the problems with companies that fail is either focused on exploitation. Let's make the most money we can, let's not worry about innovation and the future. Uh, or they focused entirely on exploration, uh, new ideas, new technology, but they don't focus on, on, on, on, on exploitation, and therefore their profit margins go down.

Speaker 1:          03:34          And eventually they are forced to make decisions that are not, uh, not good for them. Uh, not good for the long run. The third element is risk management. And we've seen that in spades in, in the, uh, two Oh eight, two Oh nine period, uh, with the economic, uh, with the deepest recession we've had since the depression, uh, firms at a high commitment, high performance organizations take very measured risks. And I'm saying they're not taking risks. They take measured risks and carefully considered risks, some characteristics of them. For example, then I found in found Hewlett Packard southwest airlines. I just interviewed Gary Kelly, the CEO of southwest airlines, and about six, nine months ago. Uh, they, for example, they are characterized by very careful management of debt. In fact, HP had no debt ever other than short term debt. Uh, southwest airlines characterized by the same thing, uh, no longterm debt. In other words, just to self financing idea here. Now in some industries, that's not entirely possible, but, but you, you live as close to that set of ideas as you can.
