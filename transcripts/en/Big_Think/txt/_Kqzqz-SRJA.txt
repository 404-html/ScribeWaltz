Speaker 1:          00:11          Now one, no program, he's actually that easy. But it's like as far as developed developing programming environments mean it's, it's really made it a lot easier for people to make you know, sites like what 2.0 type sites then then it would have been five years ago. And um, as I was saying, like when the cost of production, the ease production, the democratization of production has really come down. And, and that's, I think, you know, something that like this sort of idea of like democratization of production is, um, something that like all mediums, all media are having trouble with. And, and that to me is like the real story of not just the Internet but about like the shift from analog to digital is that we're seeing it becoming with each passing year cheaper and cheaper and easier and easier for anyone to produce anything, whether it's like, you know, a TV show or a radio show or a podcast or music to make their own music or create their own, you know, online, newspaper, so to speak.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I mean, all these things that are, it's become so cheap and easy. And then you couple that with basically the world's most frictionless distribution mechanism that, um, it's really hard for, for, you know, these, these media companies which thrived in the age of mechanical production or reproduction. Um, and I read a lot of valter venue me and like I know all about this stuff. Um, you know, it's hard for them to really thrive in that environment and um, it's, it's, you know, they, they probably should've started cannibalizing their businesses five years ago. I think it might be too late. It's going to be too late for a lot of them. And the reason why I'm getting, you know, doing something with music, which sounds crazy, it is crazy. I mean there's no reason why anyone should get into music business now. Um, is that like, I'm kind of betting that by doing things that this extremely low, taking advantage and recognizing, you know, these shifts that like we can do stuff very cheaply, very efficiently and that we don't need, like it's like a record label with like literally without 99% of the other stuff.

Speaker 1:          02:04          But just like keeping the 1% that's actually valuable.

Speaker 1:          02:12          Well, it's more that it's an evolution. Um, I mean there are people that I became friends with on prodigy then I'm still friends with now and that was 1988 or 89 that I became friends with these people. And, um, but it's funny that they reconnected with me through my space. So it's just kind of funny how that all works out. Um, I mean I think that it's, it's a lot, you know, a lot of stuff on the internet is not necessarily a difference in, in, it's not a quiet, it's not like why annotated Lee different, it's more, it's not qualitative to the different, it's sort of quantitatively different. It's like an evolution of something that happened before and, and because of broadband and improvements and web based technology, I mean, you can make the experience better and you can facilitate it and make it, um, a lot smoother.

Speaker 1:          02:56          I mean, it's like, you know, Youtube, you could have done youtube years ago, more or less, but what, what made it possible was, um, broadband and so it changed it. Broadband really changes the way people interact, you know? Uh, it makes, it makes, it changes the way people interact with the Internet because it means a lot of things that were too frustrating to do before, like download video. You know, you wouldn't want spend a lot of time on facebook of facebook if every time, you know, you wanted to click on a profile page, you have to wait a minute for it to load and defeats the purpose. And a lot of people, especially young people on facebook and my space, we'll spend, we'll look at like 60 or 70 pages in a session. And so, you know, they can, because of that can happen really quickly. It's only that they actually do want, they actually will do.
