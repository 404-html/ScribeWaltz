Speaker 1:          00:03          Is this question of scientific literacy in the United States is in fact one of our greatest challenges. What we scientists would want people to understand is a, our science is not a challenge to their religion because that's the tension that we can see rising in our society. You'll remember earlier I talked about the fact that we build theories. We don't build trues as I understand religions there about truths. That's a different thing and in fact it's that wall that actually protects religion from science and vice versa. The fact that they're really about very different things. Stephen Jay Gould, he used to call them non overlapping magisterial and I think that's about right. Even Galileel makes this comment about the difference two years in which these two activities reside. So I think that's of great importance to us because we know from looking at several thousand years of history that when religion and science clash, science generally loses.

Speaker 1:          01:05          For example, over 2000 years ago, there were two philosophers named Aristotle, aristotle, knees, and I'm [inaudible] who figured out that the earth was round. This belief was in conflict with beliefs about the Olympian gods. And so this scientific fact was lost until it was rediscovered with, because about 1800 years later. So the religion, there wasn't our one of our modern religions, but it was a religion. And there are other examples. The first person who had the idea that there might be life on another planet. It was a priest by the name of Joe, Donald Bruno. He paid in part for this with his life. So science loses when a society sees science and conflict with religion. We could do other examples. So that's one thing. The other thing that we would want people to know about is that science is a process by which we are trying to decrease our ignorance.

Speaker 1:          02:16          We want to know more about the universe, we want to know it more accurately. And the ultimate purpose of this knowing is to increase the store house of human knowledge, which is ultimately to be used to increase the quality of human life. I think most of us who do science would not do this if someone said you can learn all these things, but at the end of the day it's not for increasing everyone's quality of life. So I would personally want a scientifically literate citizen to understand that your scientists are people that are really working on behalf of not perhaps you, but that would be nice. Or maybe it's your children or your grandchildren or your great, great grandchildren or great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandchildren that in fact it's a. it's a commitment to humanity and then I guess the final thing that I like for the scientifically literate citizen to do is to be a lifelong learner.

Speaker 1:          03:20          To not disengage because most people disengaged from science after they leave university because it's not relevant to their life. They're doing something else, making money, making a life. But we're now moving into a period in the history of our nation where, for example, we have genomic science. I like to challenge people to say, look, suppose you could have a daughter that played tennis like Venus Williams and looked like corner Kournikova and played golf like tiger woods. Would you choose not to give her that opportunity? What were the genomic science? That may not become a theoretical question, so we're going to have to make clever choices as a society about the way we apply science, Genomic Science, Nano Science, you know, I walk around normally hooked up to a cell phone. I, I see you right now. You have these plugs in your ears listening. A lot of us are really plugged in while imagine that you had a genomic device, a rather nanoscale device that you could surgically implant in your brain that will allow you to directly access the web. Would you make that decision? Well, you might think that would be really convenient until you remember there are hackers out there. You want people hacking in your brain, so they're really some great challenges. Scientists really putting us into the position of defining, redefining what it means to be human, but if that's going on, we had better have as broader discussion as possible in our society about what it is that we want. This one

Speaker 2:          05:01          that happened. If the general public disengaged.
