Speaker 1:          00:08          I don't think the political philosophers have any, have any special insight into, um, into everyday politics as I, as I suggested before, most political philosophers are more interested in philosophy than in politics. So that doesn't give them any, um, any handle on what's going on in the world, in my experience in the academic world is that, that academics are not much more intelligent about everyday issues then than ordinary citizens. Um, they are more knowledgeable. They can call up historical references, but that doesn't mean they get things right here and hearing now.

Speaker 1:          00:56          Hose John Edwards was the candidate most committed to an organized campaign to reduce any qualities in American society. And he didn't get very far this, uh, this time. Um, I, I, I, I suppose I, I think that Hillary Clinton is, um, is of the remaining to the most like a European social democratic politician, a policy wonky with a lot of ideas about concretely what ought to be done. Um, and with all the compromises that social democratic politicians always ended up making, um, and Obama is, um, is from my perspective, a relatively unknown, uh, uh, quality. He, um, I suppose he is a centrist Democrat and any, any Democrat centrist, right or left is going to, um, is going to change the way America has been moving in the last eight years, maybe in the last 40 years. Um, but how, how committed he is to change. I know he's committed to the rhetoric of change, but how committed he is to actual concrete change on the ground and how prepared he is to fight the necessary fights which will be very partisan and very ugly in. Won't permit him to ride above partisan conflict the way he has been doing in the, in the campaign. How prepared he is for that. I don't, I don't know.
