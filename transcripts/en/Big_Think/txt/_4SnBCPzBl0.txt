Speaker 1:          00:05          There's quite a lot about the ethics of the way they treat non human animals. I say non human, because of course we are. Animals were not plowed, so I thought fun guy went up. Bacteria, we all, we all animals. Um, there is uh, a double standard, uh, in our ethics of precedent, which place, which builds a wall around our own species, Homo Sapiens, which is rather odd evolutionary, or you could think about the fact that we are close cousins of chimpanzees. We think about the fact that we are descended from a common ancestor that lived only about six or 7 million years ago. If you want to erect a moral wall around our species and say, for example, that a human embryo, even a very beginning human embryo a long before it develops, the nervous system is somehow worthy of moral consideration than an adult chimpanzee. Then that is a rather evolutionary viewpoint.

Speaker 1:          01:05          If you look back in our ancestry, at what point would you draw the line? Would you give? If there were Australopithecus answer's almost certainly our ancestor Australopithecus of 3 million years ago. If you were to meet what if wanted, survived in the African jungle when you give it the same moral consideration as, as the rest of us, or would you say? No, no, that's what has the same moral consideration as a chimpanzee. Um, if we look back in history a couple of centuries ago, most people accepted slavery and, uh, nowadays, of course that's a horrifying thought. No, we don't. No civilized person today except slavery. And if you look back further, still, we had the appalling things that the Romans were doing in the coliseum with, with spectator sport, watching people killing other people, lions, killing people regarding it as fun entertainment to take the children not to.

Speaker 1:          02:05          We're certainly getting better as steven pinker has said in his book, the better angels of our nature and Michael Shermer has in his book on the moral Argh. Um, so we're changing a lot and it's there for sort of fairly obvious thing to do, to look into the future and say, what will our future descendants think when they look back at us? The way we look back at our slave owning ancestors with horror, what will our descendants will look back on it in our time, and I think the obvious candidate would be the way we treat non human animals. Uh, my view would be that we want to avoid suffering. Therefore, the criterion would be, can this creature suffer? This is the criteria. And that Jeremy Bentham, the great moral philosopher laid out, uh, Kevin, can they suffer? There's every reason to think that mammals, at least, uh, I'm probably many more cans, can suffer perhaps as much as we can pain.

Speaker 1:          03:09          Think about what pain is for biologically speaking. Pain is a warning to the animal. Doesn't do that. Again, if the animal does something which is which results in pain, that is a kind of ritual death. It's telling the animal. If you do that again, you might die and you might fail to reproduce. That's why not for selection has built pain into our nervous system, was built the capacity to feel pain into our nervous system. So don't mess around with a whole nuts because it's painful. Don't do that again. Don't pick up burning coals from the fire. Don't do that again. There's absolutely no reason as far as I can see why a nonhuman animal, a dog or a chimpanzee or a cow should be any less capable of feeling pain than we can. When you think of what pain is actually doing, pain feels like something primitive feels like something like seeing color or smelling a rose or something like that.

Speaker 1:          04:11          It doesn't feel like the kind of thing for which you need intellect and actually you can go even further than that. You might say, since pain is there to warn the animal, not to do that. Again, an animal which is a slow learner and animal which is not particularly intelligent, might actually need more intense pain in order to deter it from doing that. Again, then a human who is intelligent enough to learn quickly not to do that again, so it's. It's even possible that nonhuman animals are capable of feeling more intense pain than we are. I'm not sure how far I want to push that argument, but I think at least I can say this absolutely no reason to suppose that they feel less pain than we do, and we should give them the benefit of the doubt.
