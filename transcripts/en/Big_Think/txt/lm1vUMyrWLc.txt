Speaker 1:          00:05          You know, I, I, uh, when I was at the paper, uh, I would let my assistant, Arthur Bovino very good journalists, uh, he and I would, we had a game, we would both read the paper before we came to work and we would bet on what was the mail going to be about, what were people going to be complaining about. And of course, within a couple of months we knew exactly what people would be complaining about. We learned how the average times reader or not even the average time sort of the times readers in general responded to the newspaper. So I began to respond that way and I would see things that would irritate me that I might not have noticed at an earlier time. I tried to stop doing that when I left the paper. And I've been pretty good about it. The only time that I really wanted to go and grab somebody around the neck was the Duke Lacrosse case.

Speaker 1:          00:47          And I'm happy to save it. I'm proud to say I gave a speech to the journalists, journalism fellows at Harvard, um, while that was breaking barriers within the first month. And I said, this is going to be a catastrophe. This journalism is not good journalism and this is something where a story is being blown up to much larger scale than it deserves to be because it fits so many preconceptions of so many of the editors at the Times. Uh, you know, it was white over black, it was rich over pour, it was educated over an educated, it was male over female. Aha, let's go do something about this. And uh, because the times did it, that led to everybody else doing it. So Newsweek does a cover story that never would've happened had not, the times has been putting it on the front page for several days. So that was driving me crazy. On the other hand, it wasn't my job any longer to be the cop. So I left that to my successor.

Speaker 1:          01:43          Well, the biggest problems confronting the time, specifically we at the same problems as providing it, confronting everybody in the news business, which is that people don't seem to be willing to pay for their news or let me turn that around. I think the times it seems very reluctant to charge people for the news, although they have announced that they're going to begin charging, uh, online, um, in early 2011. Uh, I still sense of trepidation and I wish it were otherwise. I wish they had more confidence. I think that it may be hard for this regional paper, that metropolitan paper or the small town paper to charge for news, but I think the times can get away with it because it is the, for a large portion of the educated populace, it is the authoritative voice on what's happening in the world. Um, you know, there are something like, I don't know how many tens of, I think it's now over 10 million people.

Speaker 1:          02:33          Let me restate that. You know, there are millions of people who go to that website every day, all over the world. Now if you started charging $10 a month, would a lot of them stop? Yes. Would all of them stop note would 50% stop? I don't know. But I did the math not long ago and I think that if 20% of them stayed, that would cover the cost of the newsroom and what the people in the news business seem reluctant to realize is that's the only thing that matters, that that it's the production of news being rewarded with revenue to cover the costs and perhaps produce a profit. That's what counts. The making of a newspaper isn't what counts. And I think you know, if, if, if, if somebody had gone to the newspaper Publishers and magazine Publishers of America 20 years ago and said, I have a new business model for you.

Speaker 1:          03:17          No paper, no ink, no trucks, no teamsters, no pressman, no printer's Union, no newsstands. They'd say, give it to me tomorrow. This is heaven. We just want to put our words and pictures out there. But they were so intent on protecting the current revenue stream. The money that advertisers pay and the money that individuals pay for the paper, that they didn't see that this was a boon for them and they made the same mistake that the music business made in the music business, lost control of their industry. They lost control of it, the Steve Jobs, because they want it to continue to sell cds for $15 each. And I think that the same thing's happening in the print business. I'm glad to see that the times is moving, and I think once the times moves, many other institutions will move as well. Charge people for your product if they're not willing to pay for it, maybe you've got a problem with your product.

Speaker 2:          04:08          Yeah.
