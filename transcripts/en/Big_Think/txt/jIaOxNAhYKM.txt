Speaker 1:          00:00          If you're graduating right now or you've just graduated, I would make a very simple observation.

Speaker 2:          00:10          Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10          Because I think you're very lucky to be graduating now because 25 years ago when people graduated and went, let's say, had a job in investment banking and very successful careers at, let's say today they're in their middle to late fifties and they've just retired and you meet them at a cocktail party. What do they tell you about

Speaker 1:          00:36          CEO of an investment bank? They tell you about the peace corps years and what they did in the Peace Corps. I'm saying, wait a minute, you've just had this amazing life and you're talking about the peace corps. And then they say, yeah, and now I'm going to use the rest of my life to do something meaningful, made a lot of money, and my kids are graduated empty nest and I now I'm going to do something meaningful. And I say to myself, wow, here's somebody who graduated and basically did something meaningless for a period of time and then decided to do something meaningful. And the reason I'm so enthusiastic about people who graduate today is that we're starting to understand that it's possible to have meaningful lives all the way along and to be a social entrepreneur. If you want to put your entrepreneurial energy in that way, to do things that in fact do mix market with mission.

Speaker 1:          01:33          It's in fact a period today where you can take an avocation and turn it into something that's very intimately connected with what you do and if you are, you know, toying with taking a job because it pays well but you hate it, don't do that. Don't ever do that because it is be the saddest peer. You're going to wake up every morning unless you really wake up and not only smile about it, but you tell your spouse or your family what happened. Then how excited you are. That's the life you want to live in more than ever before. Lots and lots of people can do that and so that's why I think graduating today would be really interesting. 30 years ago, we were a bit more in lockstep, obedience, and you did things because you were supposed to, an opportunity didn't include making the world a better.
