Speaker 1:          00:00          A large percentage of what people will contribute to something is sometimes it's as much a donation in support of a relationship as it is a donation in support of a cause. What we wanted to be sure to do was make sure that for the motivated person who's got a target and a goal that that what we were engineering was an incredible toolbox for them to use all of our best ideas that we've ever had and even to source from other people by surfing around in the site, effective ways of taking their motivation and their energy and you know, leveraging it into really good productivity in terms of their personal fundraising. So on the one hand you want to supply the motivated person with everything they need to do a really good job. The next ring out is people who might not have a specific connection.

Speaker 1:          00:56          So for organizations, we think one of the things that's really potent is the idea of in some ways doing what Obama did, which is take people who are already donors to you and turn them into small fundraisers for you. You know, I mean, if a person is capable of giving 50 bucks themselves, but it's really easy for them to reach out to their family and friends and just on the strength of personal relationships, say, could I get, um, you know, 10 more people to donate 50 bucks, then they've just multiplied their own capacity by 10 times. Anyone who was involved in fundraising will tell you that that kind of multiplying effect, it has huge ramifications.
