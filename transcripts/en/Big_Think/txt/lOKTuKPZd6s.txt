Speaker 1:          00:09          One of the biggest factor that can effect this is a tension, for instance. I mean, if you do not pay attention to something, it's very unlikely that you will learn what, uh, you have. Uh, what, what, uh, he just, uh, just so for instance, just to make an example, a, I bet the many people may not have as many of us remember what we did on September 11th because you know, there was a coincidence just if we paid particular attention to or, or what happened that day. I bet that much less people will remember what happened the day before or two days before. So that's attention is also is very, very important. Another factor that it is very important that would be motivation to, if you don't care about doing something, he will not learn about. If you are depressed or things like that. You will not learn what he, uh, what you just saw.

Speaker 1:          01:26          What you just did will not memorize what you just did. Obviously, you need to be able to perceive the stimulus. If you cannot see no way that he will remember us or she's not here. You cannot remember words, so we need to be able to get through to those, uh, those things. This is the staff that we help remembering of usually a, those are not the only things because we can monitor also to chemicals and uh, uh, two other ways. Also memories and hopefully in the future will be even better at that. So we can also stimulate memory chemical.

Speaker 1:          02:16          They, what they do, they, they will work at the level of the synaptic connection. And since at the time or memory, there is a chain of chemical reaction and the level of signups and I came here actually means the same as soon as a protein enzyme molecules are activated. What do we do? We kind of forced the system artificial through this chemical and so the knowledge this chemicals to announce a, to announce a memory and they will do this very well in animals and hopefully we'll be able to do it in people as well. How many chemicals that one can use to enhance memory. And there are many proteins that are relevant to the process of learning and memory. For instance, uh, uh, all chemicals that act on a particular gene, particular gene by the name of crab, um, that stimulate his gene and they came out in several different ways are all molecule that in animals work quite well at enhancing memory they had available. But we can give an extra, an additional amount. What we do in with these chemicals, we take advantage of knowledge or what normally happens in nature and a little bit push in this is ending diseases even easier because sometime if in disease we find out that one of this chemical is a less, uh, in lower amount than what you would be normally. We just help the process by giving it efficiently.
