Speaker 1:          00:03          Well, I don't think we'll engineer our way out of the energy crisis, but I think if we adopt a series of prudent policies, uh, uh, we may get there and by that I think we need a lot greater attention paid to energy efficiency, which is still the single best way to deal with the energy situation is not to use it. If there's a way to, uh, to do so. And I'm not talking about, you know, sitting in the dark, I'm talking about simply a better technology that gives you the same bang for the buck. But if we focus on energy technology, if we moved towards cleaner vehicles and our transportation sector and our electric utility sector, I think, uh, you know, we can get there, but it's a, it's a hard slog because, um, while we talk about, you know, needing to reduce our energy consumption because of concerns about climate change, I always like to remind people that they're roughly one point 6 billion people in the world who have no access to electricity and even more who have no access to commercial energy. And we can't forget those people. As we, uh, uh, deal with our own part of the problem.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Well, it's certainly not, not only not fair from a human, a human point of view, but I think it's more ominous than that. I think in the kind of world we live in, in modern communications and people who have very little, certainly aren't unaware of how those of us that have very much live and I think at some point we're going to start seeing a increased political violence and potential increased risks of terrorism rather than just have people wallow in their misery and kind of die unnoticed by the rest of us. Well, some of the developing countries, of course being very poor countries, I'm thinking particularly maybe some of the Central African countries, uh, they're problem is they don't have the resources to do what they need to do, to adopt, to, uh, uh, to climate change or to take actions to mitigate the effects of climate change. Many of these countries are suffering from deforestation or growing incursions by the desert, what we call desertification. And increasingly many, many parts of their countries are uninhabitable. We're beginning to see climate refugees move across international frontiers in response to these changes. So I think we need to go in with renewable energy technologies, uh, that makes sense given the local environment and try to provide a better modicum of life, but also to dissuade them from continuing to denude, uh, uh, the remaining forest that they have.

Speaker 1:          02:47          Well in many parts and many parts of the emerging market countries, uh, I think wind and solar offer probably the two greatest potentials, uh, uh, certainly all of North Africa has a great solar resources and a lot of the desert regions have pretty consistent wins. So you want to start with that and then you need to use those technologies, you know, to help with wells, develop water supplies and wind and solar, uh, uh, generated electricity can help alleviate those kinds of problems as well.
