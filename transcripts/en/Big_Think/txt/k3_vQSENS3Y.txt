Speaker 1:          00:08          I think the pleasure, funnily enough of the greatest pleasure of writing comes from the response you get from the readers. Here I am in New York. You walk down the street, people stop and talk to you and say how much they love the book and the sort of praise and uh, there's been coming in for the, for the latest book is very touching, so it's damned hard work. Of course, I meant let's get ourselves, you, you, it's, it's not an easy job being a writer, but once it's finished and you've done it and it's published and it's in the shops and if you're lucky, it goes on the best seller's list. That's very exciting indeed.

Speaker 2:          00:43          I don't find that a struggle because I spent a year

Speaker 1:          00:46          before I sit down to write on the first day and then I go away and have a very disciplined routine. I rise at five in the morning and I start work at six. I work from six until eight from 10 until 12 from two until four from six until eight. I've got to bed about nine 30 10 having a light supper and then I'll get up again at five the next morning. And there's 50 days of that is the beginning of what you call the struggle and that it's tough work. And that's probably three or 400 hours. And then I take a break and then I will go back to it. And the last draft of a prisoner of birth, my latest book was probably the 16th or 17th drops before anybody read it.

Speaker 2:          01:33          Great processors. Not

Speaker 1:          01:34          easy to describe because it's a bit like if you're a violinist or if you're a painter. I'm a storyteller. So this is happening all the time. My mind is buzzing off in different directions all the time. But I don't sit down and write a book until I've had a year of thinking about an idea and taking it through. So the idea in a prisoner of birth is the story of a young man born in the east end of London, the poor part of London, who takes his girlfriend to the west end to ask her to marry him, and he gets involved in a fight, nothing to do with him, and he's arrested for murder and he then you see the trial and he's condemned for murder and sent to a prison from where no one has escaped. But he does escape. He gets out and he seeks revenge on the four people who put him there in the first place. Of course, I see it clearly as an updating of the count of Monte Cristo and the genius of Dumas's book was the way the prisoner got out and the way he raised the money or add the money to gain revenge on the four people. So even before I sat down to write, I made the decision, I must know how Danny can't rate gets out of prison. I must know how Danny can't rate gets the money that will make it possible for him to succeed.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Trust.

Speaker 1:          03:01          I've had problems where I've got to a point and I can't see a way out of it, but I've never, I've never actually sat down and thought, oh, I don't know what to do next. And they were never,

Speaker 1:          03:16          well, on that particular occasion, it arose in a book I wrote called as the crow flies where I had an Australian. I'd had to have a man flight to Australia to solve the mystery of how he would inherit the fortune. And when he got there, the person who was going to solve it had died a few weeks before he arrived. That was suddenly thrown on me when I went to bed that night, and I didn't have the answer when I woke the next morning. So I walked around a golf course for three days on and on and on until suddenly in a split second, it broke. And it was so simple as all good ideas are that got me off the hook.
