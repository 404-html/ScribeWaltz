Speaker 1:          00:10          I agree with the premise of the question because the rate of change is just so fast, whether it's through globalization or technology that you know, if it were ever true that you could do sort of a five year plan and then just put it aside and executed. It's certainly not true today. Uh, and there is a constant need to innovate. And one of the ways that we've benefited is we do a lot of our business development, um, in partnership structures, uh, whether that's in the US or globally. And that allows us to kind of go to school, if you will, on what other organizations are also doing. So for example, take the mobile sector. You know, if you only looked at the u s market where frankly our, you know, cell phones and our networks are so far behind, uh, what it's possible to do with, you know, mobile devices in Europe or in Asia, that you wouldn't even see the possibilities. But because we're a global company, we were able to see six years ago the potential for those devices being entertainment devices as well as, you know, email and phone devices. And began striking deals with companies overseas to test different kinds of content, whether it was games or video. So I think looking outside of your own organization and working with your partners, even vendors can be an interesting source of innovative ideas.
