Speaker 1:          00:03          There is a lot of water on Mars and there once was a lot of surface flowing water. You don't, uh, you don't see it because it's, most of it is mixed with the soil which we call regolith on Mars. So the Martian soil can be anywhere from as little as one percent in some very dry desert, like areas to as much as 60 percent water. One strategy for getting water when you're on Mars is to break up the regolith, which would take something like a Jack Hammer because it's very cold. It's very frozen. If you can imagine making a frozen brick or a chunk of ice that's mostly soil and maybe half water and half soil, that's what you would be dealing with. So you need to break this up, put it in an oven. As it heats up, it turns to steam your, run it through a distillation to, and you have pure drinking.

Speaker 1:          00:58          Water comes out the other end. There is a much easier way to get water on Mars. Um, in this country we have developed industrial dehumidifiers. Um, and there's a very simple machines that simply blow the air in a room or a building across a mineral called zoo lights. Zeolite is very common on earth that's very common on Mars and Zeolite is Kinda like a sponge. It absorbs water like crazy. It takes the humidity right out of the air, then you squeeze it and outcomes the water. And scientists working for NASA at the University of Washington as long ago as 19 in the 19, late 19 nineties, developed a machine called a waiver that very efficiently sucks water out of the Martian atmosphere. So water is not nearly significant problem that appears to be. We also know from orbiters around Mars and right now there are five satellites orbiting Mars. We know from photographs that these orbiters have taken, and I'm a geological studies that they've done that. There is frozen ice on the surface of Mars. Now. There's tons of it at the polls. Some of it is overladen with frozen or mixed with frozen carbon dioxide. But in many craters on Mars, there apparently are sheets of frozen water. So if early astronauts are early voyagers tomorrow's where to land near one of those sheets of ice in a crater, um, they would have all the water they need.
