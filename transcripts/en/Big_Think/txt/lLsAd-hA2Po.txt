Speaker 1:          00:09          I wouldn't say it was a dilemma, but it was a. It was a problem and it was a a not uncommon problem for a big global company in the early 19 nineties, we started to do global sourcing and what that means is you're basically buying a either product or sub assemblies or things that go into products from companies outside the United States where you have a contractual relationship with them. They're not your employees, they're third parties. The question was would we impose ethical sourcing on those companies and by that we mean that you make sure that they had no prisoner child labor, that they had decent environmental standards, that they had decent wages and decent working conditions and decent living conditions. If the employees in fact lived on the facilities. We had no legal obligation to do that because these were not our facilities. These were not our employees, but we decided that we would require this of our sourcing partners because it was important to do for at least three reasons.

Speaker 1:          01:06          Number one, we were concerned that there might be enforcement of law against them which would stop supply even though enforcement in some of these countries like China is very erratic. Number two, we were very concerned about our employees morale if we had one set of standards 50 miles away, but allowed much poor standards in our suppliers. That would be, I think for at least some employees. Very disconcerting. Why were we being so hypocritical? One standard in our plants and other standard somewhere else, especially when those standards could be very injurious to the public. For example, one of the early suppliers I went to in China was literally putting mercury from making light bulbs in the sluice ways which went into the rice paddies, which we of course put a stop to a and then the third reason, at least in the company that I worked for is that we were an icon of globalization and one of the criticisms of globalization is that you're exporting bad practices that you wouldn't do at home.

Speaker 1:          02:00          So we felt that it was important that in our supply chain we not allow these kinds of bad practices. That would be an example of a decision that we made was not required by law that you could call. It was an ethical decision, something beyond what the law requires, which we gave a lot of thought to and very early in the, in the early nineties, mid nineties, started to have a program when we qualified suppliers that they had to meet these other conditions involving child labor, prison labor environment. So on. Not just that they made good products in their finances were okay. So that would be an example of how you reason about establishing a global ethical standard beyond what the law requires.
