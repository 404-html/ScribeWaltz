Speaker 1:          00:00          Mm,

Speaker 2:          00:05          so when we sleep and we have an empty stomach, then the activity, the contractile activity of our gut changes to a very unique pattern. It's a 90 minute cycle, very powerful wastes of contractions migrate from the Esophagus all the way down to the nfr, large intestine, and they move very slowly. They have been. So this has been referred to as the intestinal housekeeper that sort of cleans the gut from any residue that's present, um, and the rhythm for that is generated by the brain. So it's dependent on the input of the Vegas nerve on the, on the second brain in the gut.

Speaker 2:          00:52          And this has been something that also should occur when during daytime, when I'm in between meals or when our stomach and intestinal system is, is empty. However, with this sort of modern habit of snacking in between meals, um, so a lot of people don't have that during the day, but have it during sleep. If you add the microbes into this now, um, it's, it's quite likely I'm not really proven it. I mean, the microbes obey some kind of a circadian rhythm by themselves. So the different drink, sleep and during daytime, um, but it's, it's quite plausible to assume that this powerful waves that sort of cleans everything out will also affect the microbes, the composition of the microbes because if we don't have it, so people that don't have that for some, for some reason they will develop abnormal. I'm quoting cessation for example, of the small bowel was a lot of microbes that don't really belong there.

Speaker 2:          01:59          So clearly an important role in regulating the populations and the regional distribution of these microbes now got what happens during sleep, so during, during rem sleep, um, and so on behalf in a lot of activity going on within the autonomic nervous system, circuits within the brain and the signals is being sent to the gut. So our bodies inhibited, um, but not, not our intestinal activity. So in, in many ways, emotions they received. Usually there'd be experienced visually in our dreams, have their mirror image in terms of God's activity, contractions, secretions. And again, I mean, just like everything that goes on within the brain emotionally always is reflected. Just like our facial expression reflects our emotions. Everything reflects our emotional state, either waking time asleep, time at the gut level, and the Micros who live in that environment or affected by it. So it's, it's an area that's not studied in great detail, but probably very important for an understanding of how the microbes, the gut and the brain interact, um, and maintain health. So sleep is a very important ingredient for, for health regulation of the immune system, but for the also regulation of the, um, of gut function and particularly got microbial, um, integrity and wellbeing. We know quite a bit about what happens during sleep and during dreaming in psychoanalysis, this is a big window into our emotional lives. So Union or in Freudian psychoanalysis have spent a lot of time interpreting dreams and getting an access to this, to this process. A big portion is probably the processing and constantly dation of memories that have been experienced in the day.

Speaker 2:          04:11          Many of these of these memories have a gut feeling components because every time we have an emotion during the data is always a counterpart at the gut level. That is then through the sensory pathways, goes back to the brain. We may not experience it during the daytime, but it's encoded in this vast database within the brain. So what happens then during sleep, there's this retrieval and then processing consolidation of these memories, including all the guts feelings that are associated with, with those experiences that we had during the day. I think it's a very important point to emphasize that emotions have an integrated component of got activity and got feelings regardless if we feel it like the butterflies in the stomach or the knot in the stomach, every emotion has a component that the brain engages got activity and that's being reported back to the brain. So you have to look at an emotion really is a circular process within the brain, gut access, and um, during sleep and during dreaming. It's almost certainly a consultation and processing of these myriad of, of gut feelings that are generated throughout the day.
