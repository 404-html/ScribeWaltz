Speaker 1:          00:10          Green for all is a national organization. We're dedicated to creating green collar jobs. Those are jobs in the solar industry, wind industry, clean energy, overall green construction, organic food, water conservation, uh, those green collar jobs, getting them to low income people, disadvantage people, people of color. Uh, we want to fight pollution and poverty at the same time by making sure that this green wave that's coming is strong enough and inclusive enough to lift all boats.
