Speaker 1:          00:08          Intrepreneurship is about solving problem, about, uh, uh, addressing the issues of the world around yourself is not just making money. That's what I meant by entrepreneurship. And entrepreneurship is something that we carry with us as a human being. We came in this planet, uh, to solve problems. We solve problems all around us and we continue to solve that problem. And that's how we survived. Uh, we were in adverse circumstances when he came to this planet, but we will not frightened by that adverse circumstances. We took them back grip and one by one we tried to solve them and we kept on a solid with them. As a result, we came millions of years on this planet and survived and successful. So there's entrepreneurship. I any, any human capability used for solving problem for mankind, for the planet. Uh, I would consider this an intervention.
