Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:11          yes, it was there that I decided that even if I wasn't going to die, and obviously I didn't. I'm not afraid of death. The is part of life. Most people I have met a particularly. Americans just are so afraid of death. Um, I don't look forward to it at 85. I know it's just a few years away, but I don't fear it. I believe in the afterlife, I believe, and a reward and punishment and I hope I'll be rewarded. I think some of all of that comes from having served in war. Um, and I think I'm serving in a war and seeing people die, um, also impacts on how you think about other wars. So I believe, uh, that this country has to be defended and air are just wars. And certainly World War Two was a such a just war, uh, but that the Vietnam War was not. And I thought that we shouldn't be in it. And I was marching the various demonstrations against it. Uh, I, uh, believed it was wrong and ultimately I'm a huge majority of the people of this country thought it was wrong. And, uh, they stopped it with their marches.

Speaker 2:          02:04          Well, I think like most soldiers at the time, I served in the European theater of operations and served into campaigns, one for northern France, the other for the Rhineland and I fought in Holland, Belgium, Germany. Um, I saw people killed. I was very frightened and often thought I would probably die, uh, in Europe on the battlefield somewhere, but I didn't. And uh, I came out alive. I was discharged as a sergeant. Uh, um, I think that being in a war and has an effect on your character outlook on life. And, uh, I don't recommend it, certainly other ways to build character. Um, but it's part of who you are, what you are.
