Speaker 1:          00:06          Well I think you can really trace it back to at least the 1960s, if not earlier. What we started to see going on in American politics in the 1960s and continuing into the seventies and eighties was really the disintegration of the old new deal coalition, uh, and alignment that had been, uh, kind of put together by Franklin Roosevelt and that sustained the Democratic Party as the dominant party in American politics for many years. Uh, that coalition consisted of a number of groups, uh, such as white southerners, a northern white ethnic voters and white working class voters, um, that, um, inherently had a little in common with each other, particularly when you add in, um, the growing representation of African American voters after the 1960s with the voting rights act. Um, so this coalition was sort of inherently unstable. And what we began to see in the 1960s, uh, especially after the passage of the voting rights act and the growth of the African American electorate was that, um, the more conservative elements in that coalition, particularly white southerners, but also, um, conservative white ethnic voters began to move, uh, towards the Republicans.

Speaker 1:          01:28          Uh, we had an ideological realignment that began, it didn't happen overnight. It was a, it was not something that occurred in a single election or a couple of elections. It was something that took place over several decades actually. Uh, but we gradually began to see these more conservative voters moving away from the Democrats and into the Republican camp. Uh, and on the other hand, in response to that, um, more moderate to liberal voters, uh, who had been aligned with the Republicans, especially in parts of the country where you had a moderate to liberal republicans like the northeast, um, they began to move away from the Republicans and toward the Democrats as the Republican party became increasingly conservative. So you can see this beginning with Richard Nixon's southern strategy, uh, in 1972, uh, and continuing with Ronald Reagan's presidential campaigns. And then certainly in the 1990s with, uh, the, uh, takeover of the Republican Party in Congress by a more conservative group of leaders led by Newt Gingrich.

Speaker 1:          02:35          So essentially what was happening here was that, uh, at the elite level, we were seeing increasing ideological polarization and that change began to, uh, affect the loyalties of the voters, uh, and increasingly over time. And by the time we got to the 1990s, uh, it had reached the point where, um, the, uh, old democratic coalition, uh, and the Democratic dominance of at least congress was no longer no longer existed. Uh, and it's really continued even, uh, up to the present time. Uh, now something else that's been happening a over this entire time period, and especially with the last couple of decades, it's also playing into this has been, uh, the demographic changes taking place in the electorate and the growing diversity of the American Electric, uh, were nonwhite voters are becoming a larger and larger share of the electorate. Uh, and particularly of the Democratic Coalition, so that by 2008, when you look at the contributions of different racial and ethnic groups to the, uh, party coalitions, you see that, um, nonwhites made up over 40% of democratic voters.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Um, whereas, um, non whites were only about seven or 8% of Republican voters, you know, so this is growing divergence between the parties, both in terms of their racial and ethnic, uh, groups that support the parties. And also in terms of ideology and issues, it's the more engaged segment of the public that really becomes increasingly polarized because they're the ones who are really following these debates, who are really attentive to what is going on in the congress to the positions of the parties. And so they tend to react, uh, much more quickly than people who are just not, you know, not paying attention. But what happens over time is that even though this process of realignment really was, I think, initiated by political elites, um, for strategic reasons. So you had Republican politicians in particular who I think saw opportunities to win over some of these voting groups that had been traditionally supporting the Democrats.

Speaker 1:          05:11          Um, but once the public, or at least the attentive segment of the public becomes polarized, that in turn sort of starts to constrain the positions of political elites themselves. Uh, and now they have to reflect the views of the voters who make up their, uh, their own base. And so what we're seeing today is that it's gotten to the point where the party leaders and candidates for office are really kind of constrained to a large degree by the polarization that exists among the attentive public. So if you look, for example, at primary voters, you find that, you know, Republican primary voters are really quite conservative. By and large Democratic primary voters tend to be a fairly liberal and therefore candidates who want to be successful in politics, you have to appeal to these primary voters. In addition, um, there are more and more congressional districts and even states where one party is dominant and therefore the key to success in those types of districts. And those types of states is again, just to appeal to the party base and there's less need to worry about appealing to voters, uh, from the other party. So political campaigns have become more about mobilizing the base then about appealing to the swing voters in the middle.

Speaker 1:          06:46          If you look back over the course of American history, we've been through many periods of polarization, uh, to some extent. I think, um, the period from the 1950s do the 1960s was unusual in that a degree of partisan polarization was much less than normal. Um, but if you go back and look at American politics in the 19th century, uh, and in much of the early 20th century, you find that in fact, you know, they were very sharp differences between the parties and very intense conflict and very overheated rhetoric, uh, and really nasty personal attacks, uh, on even some of the leaders that we've come to think of as among our greatest, you know, presidents, people like Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln were viciously attacked. Uh, um, Franklin Roosevelt certainly was as well. So, um, in a way this is just sort of normal politics. It's really interesting to go back and of course they didn't have the internet or cable news or talk radio, but what they had were pamphlets and a party newspapers. And, um, if you go back and look at some of those things, you know, um, as I said, the, the attacks were very personal, very nasty. Uh, I mean much worse than anything we've seen in recent election campaigns.

Speaker 1:          08:18          Oh, definitely. I mean, I think that the changes that have occurred in, uh, the, uh, in the media have a reinforced this trend toward polarization, particularly the proliferation of news outlets, uh, cable news talk radio and the Internet, which mean that now people have many more choices about where to get their political information and they can turn to a news outlets and information sources that are, uh, you know, in consistent, uh, or reflect their own, you know, their own political orientation. So if you're, whether you're liberal or Conservative, you can find, you know, media outlets. You can go to Fox News. If you're a conservative, you can go to MSNBC. If you're liberal. Uh, and, uh, people no longer rely on, you know, a few major network news broadcasts, um, to get their information the way they did, you know, 40 or 50 years ago.

Speaker 1:          09:25          Well, I think the problem there is not so much with polarization as it is with certain institutions and rules that have survived from an earlier era when politics was not so polarized. Uh, the prime example of that being the filibuster in the Senate, um, because in the past when there's less polarization, the filibuster was used very sparingly. As the parties have become increasingly polarized, we've seen that filibusters have become routine and almost everything gets filibustered because it is, you know, the only way that the minority party can exert any influence. Um, so I think it is that filibuster role. They fact that it takes only 41 senators to effectively block, uh, any action on the part of the majority that is largely responsible for this sense, uh, of, uh, of, um, uh, you know, of gridlock. This feeling that, that we've been gridlock. And the reality is that this congress is actually passed a lot of major legislation. Some of it's been quite controversial, but, uh, it's not really the case that it's been an unproductive congress. It's just been involved in dealing with some very controversial issues. Um, and on the house side where majority rule really prevails, uh, a great deal of legislation has been passed. Some of it has then gotten bogged down in the Senate. Um, and still, uh, it's still awaiting action again because of the filibuster rule primarily.

Speaker 1:          11:18          Well, I, you know, I like to say that, uh, we need a certain degree of polarization that democracy really depends upon, uh, having, uh, a certain degree of polarization, uh, so that voters can choose between the parties based on which set of policies you really support. And I think today it's pretty clear. I think what the parties stand for. People for the most part, I think understand the differences between the democratic and Republican parties. Uh, and they feel that, um, there's a lot at stake in these elections and therefore that tends to, uh, increase the level of interest. Certainly polarization can go too far. And, uh, you know, in a democratic political system, it's important that those who, uh, are defeated, uh, have to recognize and accept the legitimacy of the winners. And the winners have to, uh, understand that, you know, those who lost the last election may be back in power in the future.

Speaker 1:          12:30          Uh, and what we're seeing now in American politics is that sometimes the, the rhetoric I think gets so heated, uh, that, um, you know, there's a tendency to sometimes questioned the legitimacy of the other side. Um, and we've seen this a on both sides that both among Democrats and Republicans as a tendency to question the legitimacy of the, uh, of the other party. And the other side to question the, um, the loyalty of the other side, the patriotism of the other side. Um, you know, uh, so, uh, that kind of inflamed rhetoric can sometimes also lead to threats of violence, you know, and I think that is a very unfortunate. Um, so I think while having a clear differences between the parties is a good thing. Uh, I think that some of the overheated rhetoric, uh, and personal animosity that we've seen in recent years, uh, is really not a desirable, well I don't think it's polarization is going to end anytime soon.

Speaker 1:          13:47          Uh, I think that there are some very important longterm factors underlying it. One of which is the growing in a racial and ethnic diversity of the, uh, electorate, which is only going to increase. Uh, and so as the racial and ethnic composition of the party coalitions continues to divert, um, I think that that is kind of reinforcing this trend toward polarization. We're seeing that on the issue of immigration for example, where, um, you know, on the one hand, I think that, um, there are some Republican party leaders and strategists who realized that that the party really needs to figure out a way to reach out to this rapidly growing voting block of, you know, Latinos, uh, who are now the largest ethnic group, uh, largest minority in the country and within a few years will be the largest minority in the electorate. Um, and you know, we'll continue to make up a growing share of the population.

Speaker 1:          14:55          And the electrode over time. Uh, but on the other hand, there's a great deal of pressure from the conservative Republican base to take a hard line stance on issues like immigration. Um, so I think, um, demographic trends, um, are contributing to this polarization. I think rising education levels are contributing to it. We have a better educated electorate, which also means a larger percentage of voters who tend to think about politics in ideological terms, um, who can understand these ideological debates. And, uh, so all that I think is suggest that this is a, this is likely to continue for some time. Uh, now eventually, um, we may see the leaders of one party or the other decide that it is in their interest to try to move back toward the center. Um, particularly if that party feels that that is the only way to survive. Um, we saw that recently in, in Britain where, you know, the Conservative Party after being out in the wilderness for 13 years, uh, found a new leader who decided that it was necessary to moderate the parties image.

Speaker 1:          16:15          Um, so that could happen at some point, but it's difficult in our system because in our system, unlike Britain, um, the voters themselves plays such a key role in selecting the leaders of the party through the primary elections. You don't really have, uh, something analogous to that in Britain or in most, most other countries. Um, so leaders aren't necessarily free here to just, uh, adopt new positions, you know, Willy Nilly. Um, they have to worry about how the voters who make up their base, they're going to respond. So I think that God is going to act as a, a pretty strong break on any tendency toward a moderation in the foreseeable future.

Speaker 1:          17:07          I think it may lead to some changes in the larger political system, particularly in some of the rules and procedures in the Congress and especially in the Senate. The most likely source of change are place where I think we're likely to see change will be there. Because I see the Senate right now as being a particularly an obstacle, um, to, uh, you know, to majority rule, um, both because of the filibuster but also because of the basis of representation there that every state has two senators, which means that, um, states with a 500,000 people like Wyoming have two senators and states with 37 million people like California has two senators. Um, the 20 least populous states have less people in them than California alone. So, uh, that is, uh, I think, uh, uh, surprises a lot of people, you know, we're sort of aware that, you know, states have different populations, but that divergence just keeps increasing, you know, and, uh, so I think there's going to be some pressure there, um, to, uh, at least reform some of the rules of the Senate, like the filibuster rule to make it at least somewhat easier for the majority to govern because right now, um, because of the filibuster, because you need a superman, especially after the midterm elections where the number of Democrats in the Senate is almost certain to be reduced.

Speaker 1:          18:50          Um, so we're going to go back to having a much smaller majority, um, you know, the likelihood of getting 60 votes to pass anything is going to be, you know, almost no.

Speaker 1:          19:10          Well, you know, you hear about a ever to hear you hear a rhetoric along those lines quite frequently. When, um, President Obama was, um, of course, his first, uh, real, uh, uh, breakthrough, uh, was the speech that he gave at the, uh, as the 2004 Democratic National Convention where, you know, he talked about there being, you know, there's no, you know, red, there's no there in a red states of American blue states of America. There's one United States of America. And then, you know, he used some similar rhetoric during the 2008 presidential campaign. And John Mccain also, you know, talked about wanting to heal these rifts and, uh, appealing to those on the other side. But, you know, as the campaign went on, we saw that, uh, actually the, uh, uh, the, the positions of the candidates became increasingly polarized. Uh, and by the end there, you know, there was very little of that sort of an effort to reach across the, uh, to the other side.

Speaker 1:          20:19          Um, because the fact is that, you know, the electrode itself is very polarized. And so, you know, we have, uh, uh, a very high degree of, uh, you know, partisanship. Uh, and when it comes to voting, people tend to vote along party lines. There's not much crossover voting these days. Uh, and so as the campaign proceeds, they focus tends to become increasingly on energizing and mobilizing your own base. Okay. You know, b, because there's such a small sliver of undecided voters left, uh, in, in the middle, and it's actually very hard to act even reached those people, you know, because they tend to actually be the least least interested in at least attentive segment of the, of the public. So, and since the election, certainly we've seen more of that sort of back and forth, you know, about, um, why can't we have more bipartisanship and each side blaming the other for, you know, the lack of bipartisanship.

Speaker 1:          21:24          But fundamentally, I think it's very difficult to have any kind of bipartisan cooperation these days because the differences between the parties are so great. Um, there used to be a lot of members of Congress in the middle. You had moderate to conservative Democrats, you had moderate to liberal Republicans, there was a lot of overlap there. And therefore it was easy to find coalition partners from the other party. Now there's no overlap at all between the parties. And so to build a bipartisan coalition is very difficult because you have to, when you, when you tried to reach across the, uh, the partisan divide, that divide is very, very wide. Uh, and it means that, um, to bring in any significant number of members from the other party, you have to actually compromise your fundamental principles. Uh, and that's why I think we're seeing that that just doesn't happen. There are a handful of members in the middle. Um, and so, you know, you'll see some efforts to reach out to those few members as we saw in the early days of the Obama administration when they were able to win over, they had three Republican senators who voted for the stimulus bill and one of them subsequently switched parties.

Speaker 1:          22:46          Well, I think this person does exist, but it's really confined primarily to the opposition party, to the supporters of the opposition party. Um, and we saw the same thing really, um, during the Bush administration, particularly the last two years of the Bush administration. There were a lot of angry voters out there, but the, at that time they were, they were almost all democrats who were upset about things like the war in Iraq, uh, about, um, the Bush administration's, you know, economic and environmental policies and so on. Now with a Democratic president and Congress, it's the Republicans, especially the more engaged Republicans who are angry, they are angry because they disagree, you know, with the Democrats on issues like healthcare, uh, and budgetary priorities and so on. So, yes, I mean, I think there are angry voters out there. I think sometimes it gets a little overblown, you know, because I'm not sure that voters are angry or overall now than they have been in the past. Um, I think it's just that we're seeing more visible manifestations of that with these tea party demonstrations.

Speaker 1:          23:58          Well, they're not angry anymore because now, uh, for the most part, because you have a democratic president, um, now the, um, some of them might still not be thrilled with all of the things the Obama administration has done. But by and large, I think what you find is that there's been a reversal, you know, that, uh, you know, sort of like the, the anger is gone over from one side to the other. Not Right now, you know, because again, it's harder I think for people to get worked up when, you know, they're in the majority, um, that especially in midterm elections, we tend to see that it's the disgruntled people who are the most active. We saw that in 2006 where it was really the Democrats by and large, who are the most enthusiastic at the most engaged. Um, and now it's the Republicans, you know, with a Democrat in the White House. Uh, so that's sort of part of the normal cycle of American politics. That's what tends to happen in these, in these midterm elections. It's just that with increasing polarization, you know, I think what happens now is that these swings become greater, um, and the reaction becomes even stronger.

Speaker 1:          25:21          Well, I think certainly a, a, some incumbents are in danger, although I think that some of the, um, media, uh, characterization of the election, uh, as an anti incumbent wave has been overblown. Uh, the fact is that in all of these primary elections so far, only one house incumbent has actually been defeated. One, um, and two Senate incumbents. But in both of those cases, I think there were actually special reasons behind their losses. I mean, Arlen Specter switched parties about a year before the election and really gave Democrats very little reason to vote for him. Here's a guy who had been a republican, all of his career Democrats in Pennsylvania. We're used to voting against him. Um, he switched parties and basically the rationale, he gives us that, well, I needed to do this to survive. Um, so, you know, I think there that it had more to do with, uh, the particular circumstances of the party switching by Arlen Specter.

Speaker 1:          26:24          Um, and, um, you know, then, uh, in the, the, the Utah case, you know, you had a, a, not a primary election, but a very small, uh, uh, party convention dominated by the most conservative activists in the Republican Party in Utah, which is a pretty conservative state to begin with. So I just wouldn't want to read too much into that. Um, now there's no question when, uh, voters are discontented, um, over the economy and the state of the country that they tend to vote against the party in power. And so, and in addition to the fact that it's a midterm election and the president's party almost always, you know, loses seats in midterm elections and the Democrats are in a rather defensive posture anyway because they've picked up so many seats in the last two elections, many of which are actually in Republican territory. You know, so you've got a lot of, uh, democratic incumbents running this year who are representing states and districts that, that, you know, have usually voted Republican in the past.

Speaker 1:          27:37          Um, so my expectation is that the Democrats will lose a substantial number of seats. And, and so, you know, quite a few democratic incumbents will lose, but that's more a reflection of just the normal kind of partisan swings that we see in elections and especially in midterm elections rather than any unusual level of voter anger. And Moreover, I think it's very, um, misleading, I think to try to read too much into the results of these primary elections or special elections that have been taking place. Uh, you know, I think that is a tendency on the part of the media often to over-interpret, you know, the latest event, uh, whatever just happened is always the most important thing that's ever happened. We saw this during the presidential campaign, you know, both the primaries and the general election campaign. Um, Reverend Wright, you know, was when that, when that event happened, all that was the end of Obama's candidacy.

Speaker 1:          28:36          Well, it wasn't, uh, and again, you know, during the general election campaign, uh, all the furor over surrounding the, uh, choice of Sarah Palin as John Mccain's running mate, well, that turned out to be overblown, you know, so I think we're seeing the same thing this year. Uh, every time some new interesting event takes place, whether it's an encumbent losing in a primary, you know, or a special election outcome. The media jump on that and, and try to read, you know, into that some great significance for what's going to happen in November. Um, I think that that is a really overblown.
