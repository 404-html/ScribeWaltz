Speaker 1:          00:12          I think that the United States should use the power it has at its disposal to first of all, protect itself and protect its interests, but then to the extent that we can try to create a more stable and more orderly world. The problem is there's not very much we can do on that front in what separates me from, you know, many other people who work in the field of American foreign policy is I think there are real limits to our capacity to shape other societies that is not our business or within our capacity to dictate how other societies are going to run. I think that's their job and we're. If we try to do it, we're going to screw it up far more often than we're going to succeed.
