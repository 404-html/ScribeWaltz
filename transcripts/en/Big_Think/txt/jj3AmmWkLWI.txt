Speaker 1:          00:06          Now, what makes good design is one of the biggest questions and one of the hardest questions to answer sometimes people ask us, how do you decide to put an object in the collection of Moma? Because, you know, it's a small collection. It's not huge. It's about 4,000 objects. Um, you can talk about anything you want form function, all of these different equations that have been, um, usually, you know, they have been given the world as possible definitions. But the truth is this, um, it's a very complex recipe. The world has become more complex and you can't any more have an equation with just two variables. There's like, you know, it's a differential equation with many variables. What I can tell you is one of the litmus tests is think if this object would not on earth, would it be a pet? Would you miss it? I tell you, that's really interesting because it really helps sometimes objects are not immediately functional. They're not to be set upon to be used to eat or to be used to turn on the volume. Sometimes objects just delivery emotions or are just part of your life. That's also enough, you know, the moment an object seems necessary, then you can move on to judge if it's beautiful, if it works well, if it's a fit, wastes energy. Those are all considerations, but the idea of necessity or good addition to the world really usually works.
