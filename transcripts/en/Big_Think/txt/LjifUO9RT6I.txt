Speaker 1:          00:10          Ms, perhaps the first or second day. And my brother had been elected to the congress and he asked me whether I wanted a tour of, of, of Washington. And I welcomed the, uh, the opportunity and he brought me around to the House of Representatives and brought me to the United States Senate, brought me over to the Supreme Court of the United States, pointed out the White House along with those magnificent monuments, the Lincoln, but Washington monument. But he gave advice to me then, which, uh, really, uh, stuck with me. I was probably 12 years old at the, uh, at the time, and he said to look, you'll, you'll visit the buildings now. You'll see these buildings. That'd be, but he said that the really importance of this visit is that you take an interest in what is happens inside these buildings, uh, for the rest of your life. And I thought, well, that's a nice sort of idea, but, uh, you know, when, uh, when are we going to get hot dogs or something or other, or go to a baseball or a football game. But the resonance of that message, uh, stayed with me, uh, with me, uh, all of my life. And, uh, uh, it was good advice at that time. And it's advice I share with a, when young people come from a Massachusetts, uh, and visit the, uh, the capital, it's, it's the way, uh, only way really our democracy is going to work is if people take the interest, take the time involved themselves in the, the, the political life of our country. It's enormously.
