Speaker 1:          00:09          For any problem your work on this, a moment where the sort of maybe it's some model that no one else cares about where it's sort of all fit together and I found some simple way of doing something. There's also the models that people have heard about, some such as the models about extra dimensions, something else that we did having to do with a different way of communicating. Supersymmetry breaking. There were a lot of fuel rica moments in that making it work out. Um, and the fact that we could all tied together. So it's hard for me to pull this out because a lot of the time when you're working on something that's that one thing that you get excited about.

Speaker 1:          00:43          I think one thing that surprised us a ramen and I when we were working together was the existence of the possibility of the existence of an infinite extra dimension. Um, you know, people had actually thought there were theorems that you couldn't have an infant extra dimension that gravity would just look wrong. That there was no consistent way to do it. And it was really interesting because we came across this by working really following the consequence of our equations to the end and there was just no mistaking that it was allowing the possibility of if an extra dimension. And it was interesting to go back and see what assumptions have been made that made us think or make other people think that it wasn't possible. And just to see how the theory was almost smarter than we were in and worked it out. So that was kind of fun.
