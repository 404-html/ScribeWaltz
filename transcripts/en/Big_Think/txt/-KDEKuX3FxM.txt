Speaker 1:          00:09          Well, the American theater is lousy with hidden gems, but I think in particular there are a lot of place. What used to be, well, they're still called wellmade place, the thirties and forties that fell out of fashion when the fashion and American theater turned towards more personal expressionistic playwriting at Tennessee Williams really marks the big change in direction here. Uh, there's still a lot to be said for the wellmade witty, clever three act comedy. Uh, uh, there's a playwright named sn Bearman, Sam Bearman, who wrote these kinds of, of social comedies that are actually extremely sharp and, and, and still quite provocative. Uh, he has a play called biography, which is about to be produced off Broadway that I'm going to see that I've actually seen that produced an excited by it. Uh, John Ruetten, another purveyor of wellmade boulevard theater that's actually much more challenging and interesting than you might expect.

Speaker 1:          01:10          There's a wonderful play called the voice of the turtle three character play that has never had a modern production on the east coast so far as I know, uh, the British playwrights, terence Radigan in particular who, who are also totally unfashionable because of their, their being rooted in traditional ways of play construction. I'm not saying that this is the best or the only way to write a play. I like Tennessee Williams as much as the next guy and Sam Shepard and, and all sorts of different ways of writing plays, but I don't think that that what worked in the thirties and forties should be disregarded simply because it is no longer fashionable. And that's something that I sort of crusade for in my own writing. I look for productions of playwrights like that.

Speaker 1:          01:56          David cromer from Chicago I think is the most gifted young director in America. He had a real setback. He just made his Broadway debut last month with the what was supposed to be a repertory production to Neil Simon plays and they closed it after the first one opened and before the second one got open. That's not going to stop him. This is a guy who is his imagination just oozes out of his pores. He did an off Broadway production of our town, uh, last season. It's still running in which he played the stage manager. Nowadays, everybody seen our town. Your high school did it. You probably did it when you were in, in high school. It is an utterly familiar play and cromer without distorting it, without transforming it, beyond recognition made an absolutely new and fresh and every moment of it was alive. He did the same thing with the production of the glass menagerie that I saw in Kansas City last year. The same thing with the production of William enjoys a picnic that I saw in Chicago two years ago. Uh, I got onto him because I travel in. Most other critics don't. And so I was aware of him earlier than, than he was generally known in New York. And now he, he is at the top of the list of directors whose work I will travel to see. He excites me.
