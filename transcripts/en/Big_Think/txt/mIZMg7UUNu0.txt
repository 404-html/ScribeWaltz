Speaker 1:          00:08          That's a very interesting question. I don't think that one can say as a blanket statement that America, I'm an American. I think there are parallels in both. Um, there are, there are parallels in too much trust in government and I think you saw that to some degree in the 19 sixties with America's legacy in entry intervention to Vietnam and even to I think to a slightly lesser degree, you saw that with the wake of Iraq after a period after nine slash 11 when Americans were more trusting of their leaders and wanting to believe and then follow their leaders. Um, uh, so they're excessive trust can be dangerous, particularly when it leads to the congress and the judiciary and the press being complacent, uh, in their, in their acceptance of the official version of events. I'm, on the other hand, I'm too radical a distrust, um, can prevent government from being able to function a effectively that, that public leaders publicly, you want public leaders to earn people's trust by being honest with them, by being effective in what they do.

Speaker 1:          01:15          Because unless the government is a government is able to earn some degree of public trust, it is not able to bring Americans along the hard decision. So it was very important in Franklin Roosevelt taking American to World War Two that he was able to bring to develop the trust of the American people. Um, obviously Pearl Harbor made, made a, made a big difference in our entrance, in the world of throughput that the Franklin Roosevelt was very shrewd about recognizing the degree that he had to build trust in the American amongst the American people, and a mix even amongst people of the opposing party, which is why he systematically brought Republicans and political opponents in to work with him on foreign policy in order that he could maintain the trust to bring Americans to do something which was very difficult. Which to send our troops again into a European war.
