Speaker 1:          00:08          I must have talked about that before, but that's definitely an in Max Tivoli. There's a lot of passing.

Speaker 2:          00:14          He is a different age than he appears to be cause he's aging backwards. So he, he's always pretending to be something else. And his friend Huey is passing and there's the mme who's trying to change herself. Um, and then the story of a marriage, there's a way in which the book is passing for a while. The main character doesn't reveal things about herself and a lot of the characters. Um, I think certainly for Max Tivoli, it was very much on my mind for that time period, that turn of the century, 19th to 20th, it seemed like the moment when emigrants could transform out of their own stereotype into an Americanness and then America was ready to ready to believe them. Um, when a lot of groups we're able to do that. But I think there's something kind of sad about it too, to leave all that behind. So I was really experimenting with what was complicated about it because Max gets to do a lot of things and have his heart's desire,

Speaker 1:          01:15          but he pays a great prices so that everyone around you, it's hard to know. It's very good.

Speaker 2:          01:27          Curious thing. I don't think any of us ever thought there would be a black president phil nominee as of yesterday when we're taping this. Um, Aye. I, I, but he's, he is, he is not hiding his race in any way. I think he's, something's happening where a lot of people are accepting him

Speaker 3:          01:54          mmm.

Speaker 2:          01:58          On the terms he's talking about and he's not pretending anything as far as I can tell him. I mean, he's a politician, so he's pretending everything in a way. Um, but the line he's drawing is one, I'm prepared to stand behind. Um, and a lot of politicians, I just feel like none of it's real. I don't think it'll work. You know, I don't think people would buy it if he tried to pretend that race didn't matter because that's what he was faced with. He had to give that speech. Um, and he could've said, why are we talking about race? And the steady said,

Speaker 1:          02:33          we need to talk about race. That's what shocked me really got me. There was a story that

Speaker 2:          02:48          my grandmother told me about 10 years ago about herself in which she, a friend of her husbands of my grandfather's, took her for a drive around Rural Kentucky. Uh, must've been the early fifties. And he turned to her, he stopped the car and he turned to her and he said, Leona, uh, I was your husband's lover in the war and I'm as lover now and I want to leave with him and I want you to help me.

Speaker 4:          03:16          And

Speaker 2:          03:18          she could not tell me the rest of the story because I think the idea was so crazy and absurd that you just said, let me out of this car. I never want to see you again. And it was all over. She never talked to my grandfather about it. And she regretted all her life that she couldn't have left. But she always told me, she said, I had, I had two sons. I'd never had a job. I was a poor woman. I don't understand what I was supposed to do. She all the restrictions were honor and oddly, that's a part of the story I really liked was to identify with the woman and see how trapped she was. Obviously her husband, my grandfather was trapped. If it's a true story, which I don't know, I'm grandmother told a lot of crazy things, but it doesn't matter to me as a novelist. Um, okay, he's trapped for sure. We know that. But what was, what made her so trapped and what made her life harder than his and a lot of ways and that that was the story. I wondered what's out.
