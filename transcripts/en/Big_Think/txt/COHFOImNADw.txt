Speaker 1:          00:00          I suppose the obvious analogy for Obama would be Richard, the second, I don't buy it myself. I think Obama a stronger president than Richard. The second was a king, but a man who is perhaps politically naive who is perhaps too cerebral for, uh, the world of sorted politics. You could make a case for it. I could see Obama as hamlet, a man given to great cerebral self-examination, who finally realizes he has to act. I don't see Obama's Richard the third, the way a lot of people cast Richard Nixon is Richard the third. I don't seem Obama as Nick Beth, although I think Macbeth, when you go back to it, is every ambitious person or at least someone with the grains of ambition who can be manipulated by an ambitious person that you've ever known. I'm, the thing for me about Shakespeare is that, you know, you see these people standing around the water cooler. I work with a dozen he yorkers.

Speaker 2:          01:03          Yeah.
