Speaker 1:          00:08          And I fear that one consequences to your back, you got a call is that we are much less likely to intervene. Um, on the one hand there's just a shortage of troops. You know, everybody's preoccupied in Iraq or to some extent, Afghanistan. Um, on the other hand, there is a, um, uh, no more stomach for military action. I think people have just had it with, with these adventures overseas want the troops home and are not about to launch into another one. Um, and, and in a third perspect the Bush administration is discredited the concept of humanitarian intervention by trying to justify the Iraqi war after the fact as a humanitarian intervention when we all know that at the time it was supposedly to have to find the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction or was to attack the nonexistent links with international terrorism. Um, but if, um, if we knew that there were no weapons of mass destruction, if it was clearly there was no all kind of connection, um, Bush would not have gone in just because Saddam was a tyrant.

Speaker 1:          01:07          Um, but after the fact by trying to justify the Iraq war as a humanitarian intervention, one that I don't think is justified because bad is a tyrant, is Saddam was, there was not the mass slaughter at the time that would have justified him. Manager intervention. Bush has given the term, given the concept of bad name. Um, he's really tired. What is I think a very, you know, a high minded concept with his fairly based political needs. And in the process, I think it's people say like the people in our four core paying the price. Um, because you know, why is the international community only willing to go into dark for with the consent of the Sudanese government, you know, consent that has been held for a very long time. Um, it's because there is no more, you know, stomach, there's no more capacity to, to use military force, but also because people are not skeptical of this concept of humanitarian or convention. And so in that sense, the people that are four or of eastern Congo or, or others facing mass atrocities are very much paying the price of this, um, this cheap resorts to war and an effort to justify it after the fact, as a humanitarian action.
