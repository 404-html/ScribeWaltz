Speaker 1:          00:01          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:13          easily, for example, Jews, the Jewish Egyptians were very, very accepted. The very prominent, and I will give you some quick examples, are the assistant of our Greek leader of 1990 revolution, Sadza who was our group leader who made the revolution against the British occupation. His assistant was Jewish, Egyptian, uh, some of the founders of the Egyptian economies war, uh, and that was our way to fight back against the, the English occupation to have our own university and our own economy and our own banks and the were Jewish families. You see, it was even some of the, of the very, very famous movie stars in Egypt. The forties were Jews you see at the, it was not even accepted to identify Egyptians according to the religion that was totally impolite to say, or even to refeed that somebody ensure Christian, you'll see a, there were options like any other Egyptians who happened to be just like the Egyptians who happen to be Christians or Muslims.

Speaker 2:          01:33          So we had our very, very great positive experience about Jews with Jews. And uh, the problem with us was not. The problem was was Israel, you see, and it is very dangerous to confuse the two concepts. I would say that some people in Israel feel very comfortable to confuse, to confuse, to mix up the two, uh, concepts in the, in the sense that if you are critical against some Israeli policies, so accordingly you are against Jews. And this is terribly wrong, terribly wrong. You see, because I am, I believe that the, I am very critical against the Saudi regime and I believe it's a terrible regime, but this does not mean that I'm against all Arabs or Muslims. So I think that we never had a, we never had really a problem or a discrimination against Jews in the hole.
