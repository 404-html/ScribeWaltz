Speaker 1:          00:08          I mean, I frankly do feel that the, uh, the Europeans have a much more mature overall

Speaker 2:          00:16          outlook on, uh, on this issue. Um, most people that I know anyway, who were brought up in Europe, uh, were brought up with a little bit of water blended with wine when they were in their teens finally with a little bit of wine at the dinner table, you know, when they were in their late teens and by the time they hit 18, it's not a big deal anymore. And it's really in countries that, uh, that don't have as mature and outlook on the issue that tend to have problems with binge drinking, et cetera. I mean, there can be, I can see good arguments on either side, but I mean, I was responsible. I, I went through this weird period where I was 18 and I was legal and then I became illegal when they changed the, uh, when they changed it to 21. And then I went back to being legal again.

Speaker 2:          01:08          Like, you know, two years later I was in this weird kind of a limbo thing. And, you know, I think that I was responsible when I was younger, um, you know, you're going to, uh, I mean, I, I don't want to bring up to sort of, you know, all the classic, uh, you know, well, if you can go and fight in a war and you can't have a beer, all those things, it's a complicated issue. But I just do think that rather than looking at it from a historical point of view, which I think is often the case that people take a calmer longview recognizing that, uh, that the enjoyment of alcoholic beverages is a part of, you know, human humanity. That's, that's, that's part of what we're, we're all about buying large as human beings. I mean, we've, uh, people believe that we went from a hunter gatherer existence to a settled agricultural existence in order to have enough grain to make beer.

Speaker 2:          02:01          You know, it is central to the human experience and you know, I think it's a, you know, and it, and it's healthy for you. I mean in moderation. And it's better for you than not having it. So if, you know, if you really want to bring people up properly, you know, teach them how to eat properly and teach them how to drink properly. You know, I mean, if you wanna, if you want to ban something that's going to, you know, uh, caused a lot of problems, you could say, well, let's band butter, you know, or let's ban. I mean, if you wanted to look at the overall cost of the population, but better

Speaker 1:          02:35          I teach people how to cook, how to eat and how to live well. Oh No, there are alcoholics and you weren't quite sure,

Speaker 2:          02:48          you know, I mean unfortunately, I mean alcoholism is a disease. It is a problem, uh, just as overeating as a disease. Um, I mean beer essentially is food and people are going to, uh, are going to abuse all sorts of foods in different ways and whether this involves your, you know, eating this and that and, and growing to be, you know, a 400 lbs and, and not being functional or, you know, it's a, an alcohol problem. All of these things are going to be problems across the board and society. I think you can take a more mature outlook on it as a society and not look at it as whether, again, it's, you know, it's, it's eating or it's a alcohol. Is it a moral problem or you know, is it really teaching people how to handle themselves in a world that my hands everything to you on a platter and says, well, here it is for you to consume. And I think that, uh, you know, um, the Europeans have a better outlook on it, but there are by no means perfect.

Speaker 3:          03:56          Yeah,

Speaker 2:          04:01          well, I can't say that I can answer a question like that, uh, so quickly, but I'm reminded of a, of a, uh, Francois Mitterrand last meal, which I think lasted about two days, you know, and had sort of every little, you know, order lawns and, and whatever else, and all of his friends around him. Uh, uh, and the, the, the, the greatest, uh, the greatest risks that you can be broad. I mean, I've had, I've had beers as old as 18, 69, which are unbelievable. You know, I, I would be gathering up things for, for years, for, for, for such an occasion, so, um, and like me to, I would, I would make it that meal last for like two or three days and say, okay, then that's that. So it's not a question I get a, I can answer quickly, but I can, I can assure you that it would be awfully good.
