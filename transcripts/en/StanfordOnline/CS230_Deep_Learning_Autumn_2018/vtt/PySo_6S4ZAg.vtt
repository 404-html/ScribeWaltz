00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.480
Welcome to CSU 30 deep learning.
Um,

2
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.490
so many of you know that,
um,

3
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.750
deep learning these days is the latest how this area of computer science or AI,

4
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.700
uh,
argue of the deep learning is the latest,
hottest area of,
you know,

5
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.070
all of human activity.
Uh,
maybe,
um,

6
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
but this is the class CSU 30 deep learning where we hope that we can help you

7
00:00:33.481 --> 00:00:38.481
understand the state of the art and become experts at building and applying deep

8
00:00:39.091 --> 00:00:42.690
learning systems on.
Unlike many Stanford causes,

9
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:45.480
this class will be more interactive than,

10
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.540
than others because this has to be offered in the flipped classroom format where

11
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:54.210
we'll ask you to watch a lot of the videos at home.

12
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:59.330
A lot of the deep learning AI contents hosts on Coursera does preserving the

13
00:00:59.641 --> 00:01:04.180
classroom and discussion section time for much deeper discussions.
Um,

14
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.950
so to get started,
let me,
let me first introduce our teaching team.

15
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.600
So the co-instructors I can cut in fruition who had actually,
um,

16
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.820
one of the cocreators of the,
uh,
deep learning specialization,
the event,

17
00:01:16.821 --> 00:01:21.650
our AI content that we're using in this class.
Um,
and,
uh,

18
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.510
uh,
the rest of the teaching team,
uh,

19
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.630
Swati do bay is the cost coordinator and she has been working with me and others

20
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.160
on coordinating,
uh,
uh,
CSU 30.

21
00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:38.161
Also cc [inaudible] to make all of these classes run well and let you have a

22
00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:43.350
relatively smooth,
you know,
uh,
experience,
um,
newness.

23
00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.330
Maury is the course adviser and he'd also worked closely with ketamine in

24
00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.270
creating the online contents that you use.

25
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.660
And Eunice is also head ta for CCG Eight,

26
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.130
which some of you may also be taking.
And then,
um,

27
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.610
we have a two [inaudible] is worked on machine learning research for a long time

28
00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:09.120
and the opposition noise,
uh,
still traveling back I think.

29
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.390
And also a large team of tas that I think about half of our tas in CSU 30 had

30
00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:17.930
previous the ta discourse.
And uh,

31
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.950
their expertise spans everything from applying machine learning problems in the

32
00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:26.630
whole care,
applying machine learning or applying deep learning to problems in,

33
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.430
uh,
in robotics to problems in computational biology to problems in.
Um,

34
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
so,
so I hope that as you work on your projects this quarter as posse as two 30,

35
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.860
you be able to,
um,

36
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.210
get a lot of great advice and help and mentorship from all of the Tas as well.

37
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.240
Um,
so the plan for today is,
uh,

38
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.730
I was going to spend maybe the,

39
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.290
a little bit of time sharing with you what's happening in deep learning,
why,

40
00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.860
you know,
why deep learning is taking off and how this might affect your careers.

41
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.161
Uh,

42
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:05.161
and then in the second half have can't go take over and talk a bit more about

43
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:09.510
the projects you work on in this gloss and not just to final term project,

44
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.140
but you know,
the little machine translation system,

45
00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:14.920
you build a face recognition system,
you built a iGeneration system,

46
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:18.250
you're built all of the,
uh,
many pretty cool machine there.

47
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.480
Any deep learning applications.

48
00:03:19.481 --> 00:03:23.510
I think you'd get to build throughout the course of this quarter.
Uh,
and,

49
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.240
and also share view the detailed logistics for the plan for other class.
Okay.

50
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:33.670
Um,
so I think that,
um,
uh,
let's see.

51
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.100
All right,
I'm going to just use the whiteboard for this time.

52
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.020
<v 1>Cool.
So,
um,</v>

53
00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.003
you know,

54
00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.940
<v 0>learning,
right?
Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.800
It seems like the media is still con stopped talking about it.
Uh,
and um,

56
00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.080
it turns out that a lot of the ideas of deep learning happening around for

57
00:04:01.081 --> 00:04:02.770
several decades,
right?
The,
the,

58
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:05.280
the basic ideas of deep learning has been around for decades.

59
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.880
So why is deep learning suddenly you're taking off now?
They,

60
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.720
why's it quote coming out of nowhere on whether whatever people say.
Um,

61
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.790
I think that,
uh,
me visa and deep learning has been taking off a and why,

62
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.070
you know,
suddenly all of you hopefully will be,

63
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.470
I do really powerful things with it.
Much more effective.

64
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:28.290
Eden two or three years ago is the following on a lot of,

65
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.030
over the last couple of decades with the digitization of society,

66
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.510
we've just collected more and more data.
Uh,
so for example,

67
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.530
all of us spend a lot more time on our computers and smartphones now,

68
00:04:40.531 --> 00:04:45.460
and whenever you do things on the phone,
uh,
you know,
that creates data,
right?
Uh,

69
00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.180
and,
and,
um,
and um,
uh,

70
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.980
and what used to be represented through pieces of paper is now much more like

71
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.210
FIFA digital rec world as well.
So if he go take an x Ray,
uh,
as it,

72
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.530
at least in the United States,

73
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.130
less so than some other kinds in developing harmony has been easy.

74
00:05:01.131 --> 00:05:04.110
The United States does as much high Sean's now at that your x Ray in the

75
00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:07.080
hospital is a digital image rather than a physical piece of film.

76
00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.100
Or if you order a new marker,
right,

77
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:14.400
there's a much higher chance that the fact that you ordered a marker,
you know,

78
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:19.401
off of website is now represented as a digital record compared to a 10 years ago

79
00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:23.270
when to stay that the global supply chain,
actually if you order,

80
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.440
if you order 10,000 markers,
um,
there's a much higher chance,
you know,

81
00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:31.230
10 years ago did the fact that you placed that order was stored on a piece of

82
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:35.100
paper that someone's scribbled saying,
Hey,
ship 10,000 lockers to Stanford.

83
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.780
But now that's much more likely to be a digital record.
And so the fact that,
um,

84
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.930
so many pieces of paper and now digital has created data and for a lot of

85
00:05:45.751 --> 00:05:48.180
application areas,
the amount of data

86
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.330
has,
so the,
you know,

87
00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.470
exploded over the last 20 years.
But
what we found was that,

88
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.560
um,
if you look at more traditional

89
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.990
<v 2>learning algorithms,</v>

90
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:10.623
traditional machine learning

91
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.580
<v 0>algorithms,
the performance of most of them with plateau,
uh,</v>

92
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.570
even as you feed it more and more data.
So by traditional learning our rooms,

93
00:06:18.571 --> 00:06:21.760
I mean just the progression support vector machines,
you know,

94
00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.300
maybe decision trees depending influential details.

95
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.810
And it was as if our older learning Auburn's didn't know what to do.

96
00:06:27.811 --> 00:06:30.420
If all the data you can now feed it.
Um,

97
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.350
but what we sought to define several years ago was if you train a small

98
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:35.323
neuronetwork

99
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.613
<v 2>okay,</v>

100
00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.710
<v 0>it's performance me lots like that.
If you train in medium,
you know,</v>

101
00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:44.740
Annette is per wants me as I'll say that.

102
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.000
And if you train in a very large nearing that,
you know,

103
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.760
the performance kind of keeps on getting better and better,
uh,
up to some,

104
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:55.330
usually up to some cervical limited called area we should learn about later this

105
00:06:55.331 --> 00:07:00.190
course or a bit more performance can never exceed 100%,
but sometimes,
uh,

106
00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.260
sometimes there's some seeding and the performance,

107
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.030
but we've been able to measure on many,
many problems are we've not yet.

108
00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.940
I think that across machine learning and deep learning broadly,

109
00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.340
I think we've not yet hit the limits of scale.
And by scale I mean,
um,

110
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:18.430
the amount of data you can throw the problem that's still useful for the problem

111
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.290
as well as the size of the neural networks.
And I think,
um,

112
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:26.200
you know,
GPU computing,
uh,
uh,

113
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.230
was a large part of how we were able to go from training small to medium to now

114
00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.980
training very largely are networks.
And once upon a time,
I think,
um,
you know,

115
00:07:35.981 --> 00:07:39.750
the first,
actually I think a lot of the early work on a training,

116
00:07:39.751 --> 00:07:44.020
you're in the throttles on Gpu as she's done here at Stanford,
right?
Uh,
crew,

117
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.730
they're using crew that the training neural networks,
but,
um,
what used to be,

118
00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:49.630
you know,
one of the things,

119
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.610
one of the lessons we've learned over and over and confusing is that a,

120
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.580
what yesterday supercomputer is today's,
uh,
uh,
you know,
processor on your,

121
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.810
on your smartwatch,
right?

122
00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:03.070
And so what used to be an amount of computation there was accessible only to,

123
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:08.260
you know,
large research labs in Stanford.
They could spend $100,000 on gps today.

124
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.750
You could rent that on a,
on a cloud relatively inexpensively.

125
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:16.450
And so the availability of relatively large neural network training capabilities

126
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:20.710
has allowed really,
students really know Albany's everyone,
many people,

127
00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.360
not many,
many people.
Um,
to have enough access to computational power,

128
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:30.750
to train what are large enough to drive very high levels of accuracy for a lot

129
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:37.180
of applications.
Um,
and it turns out that,

130
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.650
uh,
um,
if you look broadly across Ai,
you know,

131
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.550
I think the mass media,
right?
And newspapers,
you know,

132
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:49.480
reporters use the term Ai.
I think,
uh,
uh,
within,
within academia,

133
00:08:49.481 --> 00:08:53.380
within the industry,
you tend to say machine learning and deep learning,
uh,
uh,

134
00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.380
that if you look broadly across Ai,
it turns out that AI has many,

135
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:02.160
many tools that's beyond machine learning does even beyond deep learning.

136
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.480
And if any of you take,
you know,
see us through 21,

137
00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.010
the right staff is AI gloss straight costs,
um,
uh,

138
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:09.780
you learn about a lot of these other tools of AI.

139
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:15.170
But the reason that deep learning is so valuable today is that if you look

140
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:20.000
across many of the tools of AI in that say,
you know,

141
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:24.930
there's a deep learning
slash machine learning.
Um,
oh,

142
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.720
and,
and,
and,
and,
and again,

143
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:30.660
70 there a neural networks and deep learning mean almost exactly the same thing,

144
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.210
right?
It's just that,
um,
as you know,

145
00:09:33.211 --> 00:09:36.450
as we start to see deep learning rise of the last several years,

146
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:41.690
we found that deep learning was just a much more attractive brand.

147
00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:47.130
And so,
you know,
and so,
so that's the brand that took off.
Ah,
ah,

148
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.670
but,
um,
if you look at,
if you,
if you take an AI class,

149
00:09:50.671 --> 00:09:54.250
if you look broadly across the portfolio of tools,
you have an AI.
Um,

150
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.450
I think that,
you know,
I'll often use deep learning and machine learning.
Um,

151
00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.950
I'll sometimes also use probabilistic graphical model,
right?

152
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:05.460
We should learn about and see CST journey also a great class.
Um,

153
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.920
sometimes I use a planning algorithm.
You know,

154
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:11.110
when I'm working on a self driving car,
you need a motion plan in the room.

155
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.120
You need various planning our rhythms.
Uh,
sometimes I use the search algorithm,

156
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.360
sometimes I use knowledge representation.
It's very,

157
00:10:18.361 --> 00:10:20.130
see this is one of the technologies,
uh,

158
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:24.060
specifically knowledge drafts is one of the technologies that is why are you

159
00:10:24.061 --> 00:10:28.080
using the industry?
But I think often underappreciated in academia.

160
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.730
If you do a web search and then with search engine PauseAble hotel and then this

161
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.490
room prices and where there's Wifi with a swimming pool,

162
00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:38.890
there actually a knowledge graph,
a knowledge representation,
knowledge graph.
But,

163
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.540
uh,
so it's actually used by many companies,
these large databases.
But this,

164
00:10:42.541 --> 00:10:46.560
this is actually maybe underappreciated and academia.
Um,

165
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.090
or sometimes even game theory,
right?
So if you learn about Ai,

166
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:54.570
there is a very large portfolio of many different tools you will see.

167
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.820
But what has happened over the last several years is,
um,

168
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.590
if you go to a conference on probabilistic graphical models,
right?

169
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:07.030
If this is time and this is a performance,

170
00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:13.410
you'll see that,
you know,
every year,
um,

171
00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:17.010
probably see graphical models worked a little bit better than the year before.

172
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.700
It goes to the UAI confidence and certainty in the AOE conference.

173
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:25.580
Maybe the one of the leading conferences,
maybe DVD in one nostril on PGM.

174
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:28.200
So you'll see there every year and you know,
researchers published papers,

175
00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:30.850
they're better than the yoga for in the state.
The,
the,

176
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.350
the fetus steadily marching forward.
I'm seeing for planning,

177
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.590
we've got the triple AI or something and you'll see a few of those advancing

178
00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.310
social rooms are getting better,
uh,
nausea,

179
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.590
potentially albums getting better again through we are gay better.
And so the,

180
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.760
the,
the field of AI marches forward across all of these different disciplines.

181
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.660
But the one that has taken off,
you know,

182
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.800
incredibly is deep learning machine learning.

183
00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:02.010
And I think a lot of this progress was initially driven by scale,

184
00:12:03.101 --> 00:12:07.090
scale of data and scale of compensation and the fact that we can now get tons of

185
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:10.060
data thrown into January and etheric and get good performance,

186
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.490
but more recently has been also driven by,
um,
uh,

187
00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.000
the positive feedback loop of,
um,

188
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:21.310
seeing early traction in deep learning does causing a lot more people to do

189
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:22.990
research in deep learning algorithms.

190
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.020
And so there's been tons of algorithmic innovation in deep learning and the last

191
00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.940
several years,
and you hear a lot about,
uh,
algorithms.
They were,
you know,

192
00:12:30.941 --> 00:12:35.050
relatively recently invented in discourse as well.
Right.
Um,

193
00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:36.550
and so really I think the,

194
00:12:36.551 --> 00:12:39.870
the initially the twin forces of a scale of data scale computation,

195
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.960
but now the triple forces have also a lot of algorithmic innovation and massive

196
00:12:43.961 --> 00:12:47.670
investments,
um,
is continuing to make deep learning,
uh,

197
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.630
tremendous progress.
And so in CSU 30,

198
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.650
are we kind of of,
um,
uh,
uh,
you know,

199
00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:01.900
I think the two main goals,
the first is to,
um,
have you,

200
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.740
uh,
become expense in the deep learning algorithms.
Have you,

201
00:13:05.741 --> 00:13:08.800
have you learned the city arts?
Have you,
have,
you have,

202
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:13.320
you have deep technical knowledge on,
um,
the Steve odds and deep learning,
um,

203
00:13:13.321 --> 00:13:18.321
and second is to give you the knowhow to apply these algorithms to whatever

204
00:13:18.401 --> 00:13:21.790
problems you want to work on.
So,
uh,

205
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.620
one of the things I've learned,

206
00:13:23.621 --> 00:13:26.980
so I think actually some of you guys know my history,
right?
So,
you know,

207
00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.500
we're up to Stanford for a long time then,
um,

208
00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:33.910
started as leading the Google brain team,
which did a lot of projects at Google.

209
00:13:33.911 --> 00:13:38.200
And I think the Google brain team to built from scratch was arguably the leading

210
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:43.201
force for helping Google go from what was already a great internet company and

211
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.190
today a great AI company.
Um,
and then,
uh,

212
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.990
did something similar at Baidu in China or Chinese,

213
00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.820
which was headquartered in China,

214
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:56.740
which kind of helped by do you go from also what was already a great company

215
00:13:56.741 --> 00:14:01.180
into today?
You know,
many people will say China's greatest Ai Company.
Um,

216
00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:04.780
and I think through work on many projects at Google and the phrase the Baidu and

217
00:14:04.781 --> 00:14:06.370
now leading landing AI,

218
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:09.280
helping many companies on many projects and running around to different

219
00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:12.280
companies and see many different machine learning projects they have.

220
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.960
I think I've been fortunate to learn a lot of lessons,
um,

221
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.290
not just about the technical aspects of machine learning,

222
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:23.890
but about the practical know how aspects of machine learning and um,

223
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.760
if you,
uh,
uh,
and,
and I think that,
uh,

224
00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.480
what you can learn from,
um,
you know,

225
00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.830
the internet or from a purely academic sources or from reading research papers.

226
00:14:35.831 --> 00:14:40.480
There's a lot of the tactical aspects of machine learning and deep learning.
But,

227
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.200
uh,
there are a lot of other practical aspects of how to get these algorithms to

228
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:45.630
work that,
um,

229
00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.300
I actually do not know of any other academic course that,

230
00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:53.380
that kind of goes into great deaf it,
there might be one,
but I'm,
I'm,

231
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.710
I'm not sure,
but one of the things that,
um,
uh,
uh,

232
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.580
we hope to do in this class is to not just give you the two as well as to give

233
00:15:01.581 --> 00:15:05.150
you the knowhow on how to make it work.
Right.
And I think,
you know,

234
00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:08.840
actually spent a lot of time thinking about,
uh,
so actually late last night,

235
00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:13.400
I actually stayed up very late last night reading this new book by John Holtz on

236
00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.150
a software architecture.
Right.
And I think that,
um,

237
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.130
there's a huge difference between,
you know,

238
00:15:19.131 --> 00:15:22.130
a junior software engineer and a senior software engineer.

239
00:15:22.160 --> 00:15:26.770
Maybe everyone understands the c plus plus and Python and Java Syntax.
You know,

240
00:15:26.771 --> 00:15:29.870
you can get that from,
from,
uh,
from,
you know,
you just figured out,
hey,

241
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:31.960
this is how c plus this works.
This is how job roles is,

242
00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.890
how python none pay works.
But,
um,

243
00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:39.890
is often the high level of judgment decisions of how the architect,
the system,

244
00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.080
uh,
what abstraction is do you use,

245
00:15:42.081 --> 00:15:46.070
how do you define interfaces that defines the difference between the really good

246
00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.720
software engineer versus,
you know,

247
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:51.410
a less experienced software engineer is not understanding and c plus a syntax.

248
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.190
Um,
and I think in the same way,
uh,

249
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:59.410
today there are lots of ways for you to learn the technical tools of machine

250
00:15:59.571 --> 00:16:02.000
learning and deep learning.
And you will learn that in this class.
You know,

251
00:16:02.001 --> 00:16:05.030
you learn how the training and you're on that row if you learned the liters

252
00:16:05.031 --> 00:16:09.290
optimization,
however rooms you,
uh,
understand deeply what the conference that is,

253
00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:12.080
whether a recurrent neural network,
whereas when an Lstm is,

254
00:16:12.081 --> 00:16:14.090
you understand where the intention modelers,
you,

255
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.060
you learn all of these things in great detail in your work on pricing could be

256
00:16:17.061 --> 00:16:20.180
vision,
national language processing,
speech and so on.
Um,

257
00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:25.100
but I think one other thing that is relatively unique to this class,
um,

258
00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.950
uh,
enter the,
I guess the,
the,
the,
the things you'll see,
uh,

259
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.650
on the deviant AI,

260
00:16:30.651 --> 00:16:34.220
Coursera websites as well as the things we'll do in class is trying to give you

261
00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:38.210
the practical no hole so that when you're building a machine learning system,

262
00:16:38.211 --> 00:16:40.640
you can be very efficient in,
uh,

263
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:44.390
deciding things like she would collect more data or not.
Right?

264
00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.470
And the answer is not always.
Yes,
I think,
I think,
um,
with,

265
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:54.260
I think that many of us tried to convey the message that having more data is

266
00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:57.680
good.
Right?
And that's actually true.
More data pretty much never hurts.

267
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.180
But I think the message of big data has also been overhyped and sometimes it's

268
00:17:02.181 --> 00:17:05.840
actually not worth your while to go and collect more data.
Right?
But,

269
00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:09.770
so when you're working on machine learning project and if you are either doing

270
00:17:09.771 --> 00:17:11.180
it by yourself or leading a team,

271
00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:15.770
your abilities and make a good judgment decision about she just spend another

272
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.280
week collecting more data or she just spend another week searching for hyper

273
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:21.270
parameters,
are tuning parameters,
your neural network,

274
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:25.280
that's the type of decision that if you make it correctly,

275
00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.630
can easily make your team two x or three x or maybe 10 x more efficient.

276
00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.660
And so one thing we hope to do in this class is to more systematically imparts

277
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.720
to you there's this type of knowledge.
Right?
Um,

278
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:42.740
and so I think,
um,
uh,
even today,
um,

279
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:44.210
I actually,

280
00:17:44.211 --> 00:17:47.530
I actually visited lots of a machine learning teams around Silicon Valley.

281
00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.300
There are other were on the kind of see what they're doing.
Um,
uh,
you know,

282
00:17:51.301 --> 00:17:56.301
recently I visited a company that had a team of 30 people,

283
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.540
tried to build a learning algorithm and a team of about 30 people was working on

284
00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:02.860
learning.
I have room for about three months,
right?
And,

285
00:18:02.861 --> 00:18:06.080
and they had not yet managed to get it to work.
So they basically,
you know,
like,

286
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.980
you know,
not succeeded off to see months.
Um,
one of my colleagues,

287
00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:15.620
so the Datasets,
oh,
Ken,
Ken,
you're broadcasting.

288
00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:21.230
<v 2>Don't say anything back.
All right.</v>

289
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:24.143
All right.

290
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.940
<v 0>Um,
so,
uh,
one of my colleagues,
um,</v>

291
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.650
took the dataset home and spend one weekend

292
00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.450
<v 2>working on lesson three now.</v>

293
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:38.173
All right,
cool.

294
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:44.410
<v 0>Um,
and,
and,
and one of my colleagues,
uh,
uh,
working on this problem,</v>

295
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.080
he one long weekend,
he rots on over a long weekend to see days,

296
00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:50.260
was able to build a machine learning system that outperform what this group was

297
00:18:50.261 --> 00:18:54.370
30 people have been able to do after about three months.
So what's that?

298
00:18:54.371 --> 00:18:58.660
That's like a,
Oh,
no,
that's more than a tennis difference in speeds.
Right.
And,

299
00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:02.260
and the law of the differences between the great machines are any teams versus

300
00:19:02.261 --> 00:19:07.261
the less experienced ones is actually not just do you know how to implement,

301
00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:12.910
uh,
uh,
uh,
is,
is not just,
you know,
how to implement an LSTM right in,

302
00:19:12.911 --> 00:19:16.300
in,
in tens of flow or carers or whatever.
You have to know that,

303
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:20.230
but it's actually other things as well.
And I think,
um,
uh,

304
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.730
Ken and I and the teaching team,

305
00:19:21.731 --> 00:19:25.840
I'm looking forward to trying to systematically and pots you a lot of this no

306
00:19:25.841 --> 00:19:27.670
hall,
so that,
uh,
when this,

307
00:19:27.671 --> 00:19:31.060
hopefully someday with ya'll leading a team of machine learning engineer has a

308
00:19:31.061 --> 00:19:32.080
little deep diving engineer,

309
00:19:32.081 --> 00:19:36.610
is that you could help direct the teams fs more efficiently.
Um,

310
00:19:37.030 --> 00:19:40.390
and Oh,
and actually if any racist,
uh,
uh,

311
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:44.620
one of the things up in
actually,

312
00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:48.210
how many of you have heard of machine learning,
yearning,
machine learning,

313
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:52.170
[inaudible] urinate.
Wow.
Almost none of you.
Okay.
Interesting.
Um,
so this is a,

314
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.890
if this is your first machine learning because this may be too advanced for you,

315
00:19:56.891 --> 00:19:59.860
but if you've had a little bit of other machine learning background,
um,

316
00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.350
machine learning yearning has a book club and right.
W W did,
I've been dumping,

317
00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.850
working on,
uh,
is still in draft form.
But,
um,
uh,

318
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.670
if any of you want to be done,

319
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.820
machine learning yearning is my attempt to try to turn,

320
00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.710
gather best principles for Tony Machines,

321
00:20:15.730 --> 00:20:20.100
learning from a black art into systematic engineering discipline.
And so,
uh,

322
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.130
if you go to this websites,
uh,
uh,
you know,
this website we'll send you,

323
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.900
actually I just finished the last,
just finish the hope of draft last weekend.

324
00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.450
Uh,
and so email it allows students,
if you want a copy,

325
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.800
goes to the website and enter your email address and I'll make sure that,

326
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.790
you know,
when we send out the book,
actually it might be later today.

327
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:42.270
Not sure there won't,
well then you'll get a copy of the book draft as well.

328
00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.850
I tend to write books and then just post them on the Internet for free so you

329
00:20:45.851 --> 00:20:49.900
could hear it.
We just emailed him,
yell out to people.
So you can,
you can,

330
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.820
you can get it if you go to the websites.
Um,
I think this will,

331
00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.100
uh,
and,
and I think this class we talk a lot about law,

332
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.630
the principles and machine learning yearning,

333
00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.300
but give you much more practice as well.
Then they're just reading a book might,

334
00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.350
um,
so

335
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.500
messy.
Okay.
So,
um,

336
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.440
Shannon will give a greater overview of what we'll cover in this class.

337
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:21.960
But,
uh,
uh,
one of the principles I've learned as well is that,
you know,
it.

338
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.420
So I think,
um,
uh,
some,
you know,

339
00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.750
my background is a cofounder.
Coursera was an educator for a long time,

340
00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.770
so I spent a long time really thinking a lot about education.

341
00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.600
And I think cs two 30 represents,
you know,
[inaudible] in our teaching teams,

342
00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.890
uh,
really best attempt to deliver a great,
uh,

343
00:21:40.891 --> 00:21:44.080
on campus deep learning course.
Um,

344
00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.770
and so interesting.
Um,

345
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:51.303
um,

346
00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:56.310
and so the format of this class is what's called a flipped classroom class.

347
00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:59.850
And what that means is that,
so,
you know,
and I think,
uh,

348
00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:04.180
I've taught on Sdpd for a long time,
right?
For many,
many years ago.

349
00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.060
And I found it,
uh,
even for classes,
uh,

350
00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.920
like CST do nine or other standard courses,
often students ended up,
you know,

351
00:22:12.370 --> 00:22:16.310
watching videos at home.
Uh,
and,
and I think with the flip classroom,

352
00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:20.650
what we realize was if many students are watching videos of these lectures at

353
00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:21.484
home anyway,

354
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.220
why don't we spend a lot of effort to produce higher quality videos,

355
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:31.810
a that you can watch then a more time efficient for you to watch at home.
Um,

356
00:22:31.811 --> 00:22:34.900
and so,
uh,
our team,
uh,
treated videos,

357
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:38.020
deviant or AI created neon kind of the best videos.

358
00:22:38.021 --> 00:22:40.180
We knew how they treat it on deep learning,
uh,

359
00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.540
that are now wholesale and Coursera.
And so with,

360
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:48.630
I actually think that it will be a quite time efficient for you to watch those

361
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:52.270
videos.
Um,
do the online program exercises,

362
00:22:52.300 --> 00:22:57.130
do the online quizzes.
And what that does is it preserves the class time,

363
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.280
both the weekly sessions that we'll meet right here on Wednesdays,

364
00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:05.200
as well as a ta discussion sections on Fridays for much deeper interactions and

365
00:23:05.201 --> 00:23:09.010
for much deeper discussions.
And so,
um,

366
00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:13.170
the format of the class is that we asked you to,
uh,
you know,

367
00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:16.600
do the online contents,
uh,
treated by Divia wholesale,
Coursera,

368
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.750
and then in class,
uh,
both the meetings with Jeremy,

369
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.740
I think Ken and I were split these sessions roughly 50,
50,

370
00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.970
as well as for the deeper small group discussion sessions you have with the tas

371
00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:33.050
that lets you spend much more time interacting with the tas interacting with and

372
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:37.920
me and going deeper into the material.
Then just the,
then,
then the,
then the,
um,

373
00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.130
uh,
then the,
then the online contents,
uh,
by itself.
And,
uh,

374
00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.240
that will also give us more opportunities,
give you,
um,

375
00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.930
advanced material,
uh,
that goes beyond the west hosted online as well as,

376
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:55.250
um,
uh,
uh,
give you additional practice with these concepts.
Right.

377
00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.410
Um,
and so
let's see.

378
00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.750
Yeah.
And so,
um,
I was,
uh,
finish up with,
uh,

379
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:10.280
two more thoughts and now I'll hand it over to Ken on,
I think,

380
00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.540
you know,
uh,
machine learning,
deep learning,
AI,
whatever.

381
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:17.240
It's changing a lot of industries,
right?
I,
I think,
you know,

382
00:24:17.241 --> 00:24:22.190
I think AI is the new electricity.
Uh,
my shares,
the rise of electricity,

383
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.870
uh,
about a hundred years ago,
starting at USDS,
transform every industry,

384
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:28.970
really the reservation,

385
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.720
see transform agriculture because finally we had refrigeration,
right?

386
00:24:32.721 --> 00:24:36.760
That transform agriculture,
a transform healthcare,
imagining going to a hospital,

387
00:24:36.761 --> 00:24:39.800
there's a day,
there's no electricity.
How do you,
how do you even do that?
Right?

388
00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.440
Computers,
mental advisors,
have you been run?

389
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:45.910
A healthcare system is transformed communications through Telecon,

390
00:24:45.911 --> 00:24:47.210
through the telegraph initially,

391
00:24:47.211 --> 00:24:50.420
but now so much a communications really needs electricity,

392
00:24:50.421 --> 00:24:52.640
but electricity transform every major industry.

393
00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:57.200
And I think machine learning and deep learning has reached a level of maturity

394
00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:01.730
where we see a surprisingly clear path for it to also transform pretty much

395
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.230
every industry.
And I hope that through this class,

396
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.280
uh,

397
00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:12.280
after these next 10 weeks that all of you will be well qualified to go into

398
00:25:12.621 --> 00:25:16.310
these different industries and help transform them as well.

399
00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.400
And I think,
you know,
after this class,

400
00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:23.840
I hope that you'll be well qualified to like get a job as some of the big shiny

401
00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:27.630
tech companies that have a large AI teams.
Uh,

402
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.760
I think a lot of the most exciting work to be done today still is to go into the

403
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.970
less shiny industries that do not yet have AI and machine learning yet.

404
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:39.850
And to take it to those areas actually underway.

405
00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:43.280
And I was chatting with the students,
um,
that works in cosmology.

406
00:25:43.281 --> 00:25:45.650
Who is commenting was that,
you know,
sorry,
who was it?

407
00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.550
So at the back who was commenting their cosmology needs more machine learning

408
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.040
and,

409
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:53.840
and maybe he'll be the one to take a lot of the ideas are in deep learning into

410
00:25:53.841 --> 00:25:58.310
cosmology because I think even outside the shiny tech areas like,
and,

411
00:25:58.311 --> 00:26:01.640
and maybe since I hope will play a role in the AI transmission of two large

412
00:26:01.641 --> 00:26:05.960
rough search,
confused unlike done transforming Internet search companies.

413
00:26:05.961 --> 00:26:07.430
And I think that,
but I think,

414
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:10.760
and I think it's great that we have those great AI teams like Google grain by

415
00:26:10.761 --> 00:26:13.970
Dewey.
I grew,
uh,
other large tech companies have great AI teams.

416
00:26:13.971 --> 00:26:17.060
I think that's wonderful.
I think a lot of the important work to be done there.

417
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.210
Hope many of you will do research AI to healthcare,
taking out the competition,

418
00:26:20.211 --> 00:26:22.550
biology ticket out to civil engineering to create in the coaching.

419
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.410
I think all of this is worth doing just like electricity didn't have one killer

420
00:26:27.411 --> 00:26:30.390
APP is useful for a of things.
And I think uh,

421
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.940
many of you will go out after this course and execute many exciting projects

422
00:26:34.941 --> 00:26:37.880
both in tech companies and in other areas that,

423
00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.190
that cosmology right,

424
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.520
or other areas that were not traditionally considered cs areas.

425
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.960
Um,
so,
uh,

426
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.100
just wrap up with uh,
uh,
uh,
two last thoughts.
Um,

427
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.710
I think that uh,
one of the things that excites me,

428
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.080
it is theirs is I'm hoping,
uh,
you know,

429
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:07.090
I don't want to share with you one of the lessons I learned,
right?
Uh,

430
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.000
watching the rise of AI in multiple companies and spend a lot of time thinking

431
00:27:12.001 --> 00:27:15.900
about,
you know,
what is it that makes a great AI company?

432
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.090
And one of the lessons I learned was really a hearing Jeff beasel speak about

433
00:27:21.091 --> 00:27:24.090
what is it that makes for an internet company,
right?

434
00:27:24.091 --> 00:27:28.140
And I think a lot of the lessons that we learn with the rise of the Internet

435
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.820
will be useful.
You know,

436
00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:33.990
Internet was maybe one of the last major technological ways of disruption and

437
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:38.010
just as it has a great time to start working on the Internet,
maybe 20 years ago,

438
00:27:38.011 --> 00:27:41.520
I think today is a great time to start working on AI or deep learning.

439
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.680
And so it's sort of way to turn on the lights on this side as well or is,

440
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:48.540
what do I do?
I control that.
Uh,

441
00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:50.950
<v 2>okay.</v>

442
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:52.900
<v 0>Oh Great.
Thank you.
Thanks again.
Great.</v>

443
00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.810
So I want to share with you one of the lessons I learned.

444
00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:58.930
Really spend a lot of times trying to understand the rise of the Internet

445
00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:02.920
because they'd be useful to many of you as you navigate the rise of machine

446
00:28:02.921 --> 00:28:06.730
learning AI in your upcoming careers as well,
which is,
um,

447
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:10.900
one lessons I learned was you can take your favorite shopping mall

448
00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:20.900
and build the website for the shopping mall that does not turn your shopping

449
00:28:20.901 --> 00:28:21.734
mall.

450
00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:24.973
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

451
00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.550
<v 0>And to Internet company.
Right.
So,
you know,
oh,</v>

452
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:32.550
like my wife like Stanford shopping center,
uh,
and I,

453
00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.300
and snappish [inaudible] has a website that even if you know,

454
00:28:35.301 --> 00:28:37.910
a great shopping mall sell stuff on the website,

455
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.280
there's a huge difference between a shopping mall with a website compared to

456
00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:44.480
true internet company like an Amazon were war and whatever.

457
00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:49.190
So what's the difference?
Um,
about five,
six,
eight,
six,
six,

458
00:28:49.191 --> 00:28:53.750
seven years ago,
I was chatting with the CEO of a very large American retailer.

459
00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.820
And,
uh,
at that time here and the CIO were saying to me,
they were saying,
look,

460
00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:03.320
Andrew,
we have a website.
We sell things on their website.
Amazon has a website,

461
00:29:03.380 --> 00:29:07.190
Amazon sells things.
And the website is the same thing,
but of course it's not.

462
00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:09.860
And today this particular large American retailers,
you know,

463
00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:13.490
future existence is actually a little bit in the question part of the part of

464
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.380
you because of Amazon.
Um,
so one of the lessons I learned,
um,

465
00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.990
uh,
uh,
really,
uh,
the variances me,

466
00:29:20.991 --> 00:29:24.590
Jeff Besos is that what defines it into their company is not just where are you,

467
00:29:24.591 --> 00:29:26.750
have a website instead.
It is,

468
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:31.870
have you organized your team or your company to do the things that the Internet

469
00:29:31.941 --> 00:29:35.760
lets you do really well?
For example,
Internet teams,
uh,

470
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.510
engage in pervasive ab testing,
right.
We,
we,

471
00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:43.450
we know that we could launch two of the website and just see which one works

472
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:46.630
better.
And so we learned much faster,
whereas a traditional shopping,

473
00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:50.320
while you can't launch two shopping malls in two parallel universes and see

474
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:53.830
which one works better.
Yeah.
So you just,
it's just so much harder to do that.

475
00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:56.260
We tend to have short shipping times.

476
00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.010
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

477
00:30:01.010 --> 00:30:05.060
<v 0>Right.
You can shipping new product every day or every week and so you learn much</v>

478
00:30:05.061 --> 00:30:07.700
faster.
Whereas the traditional shopping mall May,

479
00:30:07.701 --> 00:30:11.090
I redesigned the shopping mall once per once every three months.
Right.

480
00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:15.030
And we actually organize our teams differently.
Um,

481
00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.180
we tend to push decision making,

482
00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.040
<v 2>yeah.</v>

483
00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:27.060
<v 0>Down to the engineers or engineers and product managers because in the</v>

484
00:30:27.061 --> 00:30:28.620
traditional shopping mall,
you know,

485
00:30:28.621 --> 00:30:33.090
things kind of move slower and maybe the CEO says something and then everyone

486
00:30:33.091 --> 00:30:37.230
just does what the CEO says and that's fine.
But in the Internet era,

487
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.980
we learned that,
um,

488
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:43.230
the technology and it uses is so complicated that,
uh,

489
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.070
only the engineers and the product managers for those of you to know what that

490
00:30:47.071 --> 00:30:50.070
is,
oh,
are close enough to the technology,

491
00:30:50.071 --> 00:30:52.950
to the algorithms and the users to make good decisions.

492
00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:57.540
And so we tend to push the zoom making power and Internet companies down to the

493
00:30:57.541 --> 00:30:59.700
engineers.
So engineers and product managers.

494
00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:04.020
And you have to do that in the Internet era because that's how you organize a

495
00:31:04.021 --> 00:31:07.920
company or organize a team to do the things the Internet lets you do really
well.

496
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.370
So I think that was the rise of the Internet.

497
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.870
I think with the rise of the AI era or AI machine learning or deep learning,

498
00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:23.490
whether you want to call it,
um,
we're learning that if you have,
you know,

499
00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:28.360
a traditional company plus a few neuronetworks

500
00:31:31.530 --> 00:31:36.530
that does not by itself turn the company into an AI company.

501
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.150
Right.

502
00:31:39.150 --> 00:31:43.680
And I think what we'll define the great AI teams of the future,

503
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.020
um,
uh,
will be,

504
00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:51.240
do you know how to organize your own work and organize your teams work to do the

505
00:31:51.241 --> 00:31:53.070
things that modern,
you know,

506
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:57.030
machine learning and deep learning and other AI things lets you do really well.

507
00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:01.800
Um,
and I think,
um,
having the items that Google and Baidu,
I'm of the buyers,

508
00:32:01.801 --> 00:32:03.080
I think Google and Baidu,

509
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.030
I great and the head of many other companies and thinking this through,

510
00:32:06.031 --> 00:32:09.510
but I think even the best companies in the world haven't completely figured out

511
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:12.690
whether the principles by which to organize AI teams,

512
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:17.710
but I think some of them will be that.
Um,
we tend to,
um,

513
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.973
uh,

514
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:24.010
I think that AI teams tend to be very good as a strategic data acquisition.

515
00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:28.370
<v 2>Okay.</v>

516
00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:33.190
<v 0>And so you'll see AI companies or AI teams even,
even,
uh,
you know,</v>

517
00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:35.810
do things that may not seem like it makes sense.

518
00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:39.080
Why do these companies have all these free products that don't make any money?

519
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.990
Some of it is a car data that you can monetize through other ways,
right?
Uh,

520
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.100
through advertising was who's doing the,
about users.

521
00:32:46.101 --> 00:32:51.101
And so there are a lot of ag data acquisition strategies that as a surface level

522
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:55.250
may not make sense but actually do make sense if you understand how this can be

523
00:32:55.251 --> 00:32:59.460
married with deep learning algorithms to create value elsewhere.
Um,

524
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.180
and I think that's a,
uh,
AI companies tend to um,

525
00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.940
organize data differently,

526
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.490
right?
A AI teams tend to be very good at putting out data together.

527
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.320
I think before the rise of deep learning,

528
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:20.060
many companies have fragmented data warehouses where if you have a big company,

529
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.920
if you have 50 different databases,

530
00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.150
know in 50 different divisions is actually very difficult for an engineer to

531
00:33:26.151 --> 00:33:27.830
look all this data and put it together,

532
00:33:27.831 --> 00:33:30.230
I had to train the learning of room to do something valuable.

533
00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:35.000
So the leading AI companies tend to have unified day there and warehouses.

534
00:33:35.001 --> 00:33:36.950
And I guess,
and I know we have a large,

535
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:39.860
a whole audience or SEBD or other home audience here.
I said,

536
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:43.330
if any of you work a lot of tech companies,
you know,
this is something that,

537
00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:47.990
that many companies are investing in today to lay the foundation for learning

538
00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:49.630
algorithms.
Oh,

539
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:53.530
we tend to be very good and smart and pervasive automation opportunities,

540
00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:58.700
which is very good at spotting opportunities where you could,

541
00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:01.820
instead of having people do a toss of a deep learning algorithm to a tall,

542
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:06.000
so I have a different day,
I often do a toss.
Um,
and we also have a

543
00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:13.990
new job descriptions,
which I don't have time to talk about.

544
00:34:13.991 --> 00:34:16.360
But just as with the rise of the Internet,

545
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:19.630
we started creating a lot of new roles for engineers,
right?

546
00:34:19.631 --> 00:34:23.170
I think actually once upon a time there where it was simple and there was just a

547
00:34:23.171 --> 00:34:25.260
software engineering title.
Uh,

548
00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.310
but as technology got to got more complicated,
we started to specialize.

549
00:34:30.311 --> 00:34:34.450
So that's why yeah.
Was the Internet where front end,
back end mobile,
right?

550
00:34:34.451 --> 00:34:37.440
And now we have,
uh,
uh,
yeah.
And,

551
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.850
and then with increasing the other girls,
right?

552
00:34:39.851 --> 00:34:44.650
Qa Dev ops it into increased specialization of knowledge.
Uh,

553
00:34:44.651 --> 00:34:46.450
and so with the rise of machine learning,

554
00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:49.930
we're starting the creation of new roles like machine learning,
engineer,

555
00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:53.390
a research machine,
learning research scientists.
Uh,
and,

556
00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:56.780
and our product managers in AI teams also behave differently than probably

557
00:34:56.781 --> 00:34:58.180
manages and Internet companies.

558
00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:03.660
And so one of the things we'll revisit a few times throughout this quarter is,

559
00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.550
and I don't mean to be too corporate,
I know that many of you are,
you know,

560
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.690
some of the SFPD audience or online audience already working company.

561
00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:14.110
Many of you when you graduate from Stanford will end up maybe stop,
Hey,

562
00:35:14.111 --> 00:35:16.690
you own company or join an existing company.
Uh,

563
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:21.610
but I think that's solving a lot of these questions of how to organize your

564
00:35:21.611 --> 00:35:25.780
teams effective in the AI era.
We'll help you do more valuable work.

565
00:35:26.350 --> 00:35:31.270
Um,
and I think,
uh,
to,
to,
to make one more analogy,
you know,

566
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:32.343
I think that,
uh,

567
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:36.160
one of the things I hope I can and I will share with you throughout this quarter

568
00:35:36.161 --> 00:35:39.810
is,
um,
just as in the software engineering world,

569
00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.490
it took us a long time to figure out what is agile development,

570
00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.340
right?
Or what are the pros and cons of,
you know,

571
00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:51.160
waterfall model versus agile or how do you,
uh,
what,

572
00:35:51.161 --> 00:35:55.710
what is a strum process right?
Or is code review it?
Good idea.

573
00:35:55.750 --> 00:36:00.120
Seems a good idea to me,
right?
It's,
but this,
these practices,
uh,
after,

574
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.630
after programming languages were created or invented or whatever,

575
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:08.100
we still had to figure all these ways to help individuals and teams right.

576
00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.670
Software effectively.
And so if you worked in,
you know,

577
00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:16.370
high performing corporate industrial AI teams using these software,

578
00:36:16.371 --> 00:36:20.950
injuring practices,
everything,
Code Review to agile to,
to,
to whatever you,
you,

579
00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.110
you know,
they're having a team work effectively.

580
00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.760
The right software is more than everyone knowing c plus plus in tasks,

581
00:36:26.761 --> 00:36:30.660
everyone doing python syntax.
And I think in the machine learning world,

582
00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.880
we're still in the process of inventing these types of processes,

583
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.010
whether it's the strong,
what is the agile development,

584
00:36:38.011 --> 00:36:41.940
what's the equivalent of code review for developing machine learning algorithms.

585
00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.580
And I think,
um,
probably,
uh,

586
00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.080
this class more than more than this class and machine there,
any yearning,
uh,

587
00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.840
more than any other of these walls I'm aware of right now.

588
00:36:51.870 --> 00:36:56.610
I think we'll try to systematically teach you these tools so that you don't just

589
00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.590
are able to derive a learning our river,
um,
and,

590
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:03.030
and implemented learning algorithm,
but that you're actually,
you know,

591
00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.770
very effective in terms of how you go about building these systems.

592
00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:13.440
Um,
so last thing are the Fi,
uh,
uh,

593
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.760
pass it to Ken is the other question that I've been us I guess several times

594
00:37:20.461 --> 00:37:25.020
this week now that,
uh,
just pm to have the answer is,
uh,
uh,

595
00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:27.980
so,
uh,
uh,
there are multiple machine there,

596
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:30.150
any courses going on at Stanford this quarter.

597
00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:32.310
So the other frequently asked question is,

598
00:37:32.311 --> 00:37:34.200
which of these courses should you take?

599
00:37:34.201 --> 00:37:37.440
So let me just address that preemptively before someone asks me,

600
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:41.750
because I've been asked twice already,
uh,
in the other two classes of quarter.
Um,

601
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.230
so I think actually what's happened over the last several years of standard as

602
00:37:46.231 --> 00:37:49.320
the demand for machine learning education has,
you know,

603
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:53.040
been rising dramatically because,
uh,
I mean,
you know,

604
00:37:53.550 --> 00:37:57.300
the majority of CSP CSPC Africans to Stanford,
you know,

605
00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:01.560
are applying to do work in machine learning or applying it to,
to do work in Ai.

606
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:05.760
And I think all of you can kind of see that there's such a shortage of machine

607
00:38:05.761 --> 00:38:08.960
learning engineers,
right?
And then there's a little bit of,
and,
and,

608
00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:11.130
and I think that shortage will continue for a long time.

609
00:38:11.131 --> 00:38:13.740
So the many people see that if you're calling an expert in machine learning,

610
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:17.730
there'll be great opportunity is for you to do meaningful work on campus to take

611
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:21.060
machine.
They're only into con buyer or cosmology or Macallan Jane,

612
00:38:21.061 --> 00:38:25.290
or do great research on campus as well as graduate from Stanford and do very

613
00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:28.590
unique work.
Uh,
w when a wonder around silicon valley,

614
00:38:28.591 --> 00:38:32.520
I feel like there are so many ideas for great machine learning projects that

615
00:38:32.521 --> 00:38:36.070
exactly zero people seem to be working on because he's just on enough machines

616
00:38:36.071 --> 00:38:39.730
or any people in the world right now.
So by learning these skills,
you could,

617
00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.350
you have many opportunities to be the first one to do something very exciting

618
00:38:44.351 --> 00:38:47.020
and meaningful.
Right?
Oh,
and,
and,
and um,

619
00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:50.170
you probably read in the newspapers about how much money have machine learning

620
00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:52.450
people make.
I'm actually much less is more,
I actually find out,

621
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.610
I hope a lot of you make a lot of money,
but I actually proceed.

622
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:58.700
They'll find out that,
you know,
as,
as exciting.
I think that,
um,

623
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.270
every time there's a major technological disruption,

624
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:04.480
it gives us an opportunity to remake last parts of the world.

625
00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:07.720
And I hope that there's some of you go improve a hoka system,

626
00:39:07.721 --> 00:39:08.950
improve the educational system.

627
00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.760
Maybe you'll see if we can help preserve the smooth functioning of democracy

628
00:39:12.761 --> 00:39:14.800
around the world.
I think that it really,

629
00:39:14.801 --> 00:39:18.160
your unique skills and deep learning and will give you opportunities to do that.

630
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:21.430
I think hopefully very meaningful work.
Um,

631
00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:24.960
but because of this massive,
massive,
uh,

632
00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:29.170
a rise in demand for machine learning education,
um,
there are,

633
00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.730
so for a long time,
see cs two,
three,

634
00:39:30.731 --> 00:39:34.960
nine machine learning was the core machine learning class at Stanford.
Um,

635
00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:38.970
and then,
uh,
see us two 30 is actually the newest,

636
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.230
a new creation I think.
Oh,

637
00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:46.330
and the other costs that were involved in that unit and I are involved in

638
00:39:46.331 --> 00:39:50.980
discourse or is a cs two 29 a.
So,
um,
uh,

639
00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:54.460
so if China decides which of these classes to take,
um,
I think,

640
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:58.200
I think that these classes are a little bit like Pokemon,
right?

641
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.890
You really should collect them all.
Um,
but,
but,
uh,
but,

642
00:40:01.930 --> 00:40:06.090
but I think what we've been trying to design these classes to actually teach

643
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:10.660
different things and not have too much overlap.
Uh,
uh,
and,
and so,
um,

644
00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.040
there is,
uh,

645
00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:16.390
so I have seen students take two courses at the same time and that's actually

646
00:40:16.391 --> 00:40:18.010
fine.
There's not the,
the,
the,

647
00:40:18.011 --> 00:40:21.250
the view of all lap is fine that you actually learned different things.

648
00:40:21.251 --> 00:40:23.910
If you take any two of these classes at the same time,
um,

649
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.090
CST between nine is machine learning is the most mathematical of these classes.

650
00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:29.790
We'd go much more systems.

651
00:40:29.791 --> 00:40:33.130
You now it goes much more into the mathematical derivations of the algorithms.

652
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:34.090
Um,

653
00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:39.090
CSU 29 a is applying machine learning is much less mathematical but spends a bit

654
00:40:39.791 --> 00:40:42.300
more time on the practical aspects.
Uh,

655
00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:45.610
is actually the easiest on round two machine learning as well as the least

656
00:40:45.611 --> 00:40:49.210
mathematical of these classes.
See us through 30 is somewhere in between.

657
00:40:49.211 --> 00:40:52.000
This is a bit more,
it's more math world than CSU doing it.

658
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.950
Less mathematical does CSU 30,
but where CSU 30,
uh,

659
00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:58.120
focuses on is on deep learning,

660
00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.150
which is just one small subset of machine learning,

661
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:03.070
but it is the hardest subset of machine learning.

662
00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.610
Whereas there are a lot of other machine learning algorithms from your PCA

663
00:41:06.611 --> 00:41:11.380
K-means recommender systems support vector machines that are also very useful.

664
00:41:11.381 --> 00:41:15.610
Did I use in my work quite frequently that we don't teach in CSU 30,

665
00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:19.360
but there's towards the cs two,
three,
nine,
six two,
two,
three 90.
Um,

666
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.860
where's Soso the unique things about cs two 30,
is it focusing on deep learning?

667
00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:26.320
So I'll know if you want to have this deep learning on your resume.

668
00:41:26.321 --> 00:41:30.160
I guess maybe this is the easiest way to do it.
I don't know.
Again,

669
00:41:30.161 --> 00:41:34.270
it's not what I tend to optimize for a bit,
but,
uh,
and I think 30,
uh,

670
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.480
goes to deeper as in their practical know how and how to apply these algorithms.

671
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:43.520
Um,
oh and so,
and I want to set expectations accurate as well.

672
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:45.930
Right?
So,
um,
what,
I don't want this,

673
00:41:45.931 --> 00:41:48.550
but you guys to complain it in a Coolterra that you know,

674
00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:51.350
there wasn't enough map because that's actually not the point.

675
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.730
What has happened in the last decade is the amount of math you need to be a

676
00:41:55.731 --> 00:41:59.230
great machine learning person has actually decrease,
I think.
Uh,

677
00:41:59.231 --> 00:42:03.290
and I wanted to um,
to less math and cs two 30,

678
00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:07.580
but spend more time teaching you the practical knowhow of how to actually apply

679
00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:11.510
these algorithms.
Right?
So,
um,
yeah I think two,

680
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:15.020
two then a is probably the easiest is cause that's the most technical cause this

681
00:42:15.021 --> 00:42:18.440
the most most hands on applied and you do a lot of the projects on different,

682
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.970
different topics,
right?

683
00:42:19.971 --> 00:42:23.750
And I think these courses are often the foundation or some subset of these are

684
00:42:23.751 --> 00:42:26.980
often the foundational courses as soon as hey,
um,
uh,

685
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.310
because if you say learn deep learning some common sequence first students is

686
00:42:31.311 --> 00:42:32.001
the,
you know,

687
00:42:32.001 --> 00:42:36.590
learn the foundations and machine learning or

688
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:43.010
machine learning or deep learning at so you have the foundation of first before

689
00:42:43.011 --> 00:42:43.610
you go,

690
00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:48.610
which then often says yup to later go deeper into computer vision or national

691
00:42:48.921 --> 00:42:52.080
here's processing or robotics or the reinforcement learning.

692
00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.360
And so common sequencing,

693
00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.220
that common tactic that Stanford has take is to use these as the foundation.

694
00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.370
You see a bit of everything from quick division and natural language processing,

695
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:05.270
speech recognition,
Yo,
we'll touch a little bit low on self driving cars are the,

696
00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:08.870
is the foundation to then decide do you want to go deeper into national actors

697
00:43:08.871 --> 00:43:12.470
processing or robotics or enforcement learning or computer vision or something

698
00:43:12.471 --> 00:43:16.940
else?
So this common sequencing of courses that students take.
Okay.

699
00:43:17.570 --> 00:43:21.770
So,
um,
look forward to spending this quarter with you.

700
00:43:22.010 --> 00:43:25.820
Let me just check with the quick questions and then I'll hand it over to Ken.

701
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:26.893
Yeah,
go for it.

702
00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.160
<v 3>What's the third bullet and AI era?</v>

703
00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:35.610
<v 0>Well that and the AI decision making by engineers and product managers.</v>

704
00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:40.130
Really pushing decision making.
I wrote this is you're making by engineers there,

705
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:44.290
but really engineers and product managers.
Oh,
AI era.

706
00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.950
A pervasive pervasive automation.

707
00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:54.920
<v 3>Well you're talking about a high being the next like other tricity.
Um,</v>

708
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:55.971
I was wondering,

709
00:43:55.971 --> 00:44:00.971
and I don't say that like we're like so far,

710
00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.430
like what are the most like the most meaningful success or of machine learning

711
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.790
that you think have happened already?

712
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.820
<v 0>So all of are using learning algorithm is probably dozens of times a day,</v>

713
00:44:14.821 --> 00:44:17.280
maybe even hundreds of times a day without you knowing it,
right?

714
00:44:17.310 --> 00:44:20.910
Every time you use a website changing does a learning algorithm that's improving

715
00:44:20.911 --> 00:44:23.220
the quality of sectors else.
There's also plenty,
however,

716
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.280
trying to show you the most relevant ads and just helps those companies actually

717
00:44:26.281 --> 00:44:30.180
make all the money every time.
It turns out that,
um,
uh,

718
00:44:30.610 --> 00:44:35.190
actually Google and Baidu has public sent that over 10% of searches on mobile

719
00:44:35.410 --> 00:44:36.870
are through voicage.
Uh,

720
00:44:36.871 --> 00:44:40.560
and so I think it's great that you can now talk to your cell phone rather than

721
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:44.520
typing on a tiny little keyboard.
If you want to do a do a web search and mobile,

722
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:49.830
uh,
if you go to need a website like Amazon or Netflix or,
uh,
uh,

723
00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:50.400
uh,

724
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.120
there are learning algorithms recommending more readily movies and more relevant

725
00:44:54.121 --> 00:44:57.290
products to you every time you use your credit card.
Uh,

726
00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:01.860
there's a learning algorithm I to probably almost all companies I'm aware of.

727
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:02.960
There's learning.
Everyone,

728
00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:05.710
I'm trying to figure out if it's you using your credit card or have as soon

729
00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.870
stolen.
So they should,
they should,
you know,

730
00:45:08.130 --> 00:45:11.880
just allow the CF as a fraudulent transaction or not every time you open up your

731
00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:16.320
email.
Uh,
the only reason email is even usable is because of your spam filter,

732
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.500
which is cause of learning algorithm that works much better now than,

733
00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:24.540
than before.
Uh,
I know,
uh,
I and yeah,
so,
so there's,

734
00:45:24.541 --> 00:45:26.260
uh,
I think,
uh,
you know,

735
00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.850
one of the amazing things about AI and machine learning is I love it when it

736
00:45:29.851 --> 00:45:32.790
disappears in the background,
right?
You use your,
you know,

737
00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:36.730
you use these algorithms are you boot up your map application and the fines are

738
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:38.520
shorter's Ralphie the drive from here to there.

739
00:45:38.850 --> 00:45:42.930
And there's a learning algorithm predicting what traffic will be like on highway

740
00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:44.340
one or one one offer now.

741
00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.370
But you don't even need to think that there was a learning algorithm and trying

742
00:45:47.371 --> 00:45:50.480
to figure out what traffic will be light one are in the future.
See,

743
00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:54.570
it's really magical,
right,
that,
you know,
uh,
that,
that you could just use it.

744
00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:59.350
We can bill all of these wonderful products and systems that helps people,
uh,

745
00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.640
but abstract away a lot of the details.
So that's the present.

746
00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:06.600
And I think in the future,
near future,
uh,
most of my phd students,

747
00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:09.600
most of my research group,
he has work on machine learning for healthcare.

748
00:46:09.601 --> 00:46:14.600
I think that will have significant in rows.
Uh,
uh,
you know,
um,

749
00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:18.000
my,
my,
my team at landing AI has been lot of time with,

750
00:46:18.001 --> 00:46:21.840
with a lot of industry is for manufacturing,
the agriculture.
So all the things,

751
00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.930
uh,
I'm excited about machine learning for education,
uh,

752
00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.970
give people precisely you to help people recommended ProSites contents.

753
00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:32.440
There's fascinating research done here at Stanford,
uh,

754
00:46:32.570 --> 00:46:34.830
by Tris peach and a few others on using,

755
00:46:34.831 --> 00:46:39.240
learning our rooms to give people feedback on coding homework assignments.
So,

756
00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.850
so sorry,
there's so many examples of hilarity learning.

757
00:46:41.851 --> 00:46:46.400
I could talk for quite some time.
Yeah.
One last question.
I had that over again.

758
00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:50.230
Yeah,
go ahead.
Um,

759
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:56.000
let's see.
So the,
uh,
so the format of the class is that,
uh,

760
00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.880
you are watch,
uh,
videos,
uh,

761
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.240
created by deep learning AI and whole song Coursera.
So you see me a lot there.

762
00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.520
Uh,
but in addition,
uh,

763
00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:10.420
Karen and I will be having lectures here in this classroom every Wednesday,
uh,

764
00:47:10.421 --> 00:47:12.070
and that will be,
you know,

765
00:47:12.510 --> 00:47:16.380
completely new material that is not online anywhere.

766
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:21.210
Have you three now.
Yeah,
yeah.
Uh,
and,
and then also the,
I think the,
the,
the,

767
00:47:21.211 --> 00:47:21.630
the point,

768
00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.780
the point of the flip classroom thing really is some of the things is really

769
00:47:24.781 --> 00:47:28.020
more time efficient for you to just learn online.
So there's the online content,

770
00:47:28.350 --> 00:47:31.570
but whether it does is it leaves this classroom time for us to not,
you know,

771
00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:34.510
deliver the same lecture a year off the year.

772
00:47:34.511 --> 00:47:36.670
But to get Charlie to spend time to get to know you,

773
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.760
have more time answering your questions,
uh,

774
00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:42.730
and also give you more in costs practice on these things,
right?

775
00:47:42.731 --> 00:47:45.790
So there's the Coursera Devonta our content,
the lot,

776
00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:49.780
what we do in CSS 30 is to augment that,
to give you a much deeper practice,

777
00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:54.610
more advanced examples,
uh,
uh,
some more deeper map balco derivations and,

778
00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:57.400
and more practice.
So you'd say you deepen your knowledge of that

779
00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:00.920
<v 1>and with that,
then you hand it over to chat.</v>

780
00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:18.690
<v 0>Yeah,
I'm going to get back at him by making noise while he's talking.
Okay.</v>

781
00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:27.643
<v 1>Okay.</v>

782
00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:31.970
<v 4>Thanks Andrew.
Hi everyone.
Uh,
I'm Keon,</v>

783
00:48:31.971 --> 00:48:36.110
we're excited to have you here today.
Those of you who are in class,

784
00:48:36.111 --> 00:48:39.200
but also those of you who are,
or CPD students.
Uh,

785
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:43.430
we wanted to take a little more time to explain a little bit about the course

786
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:46.130
logistics,
what this course is about,

787
00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:50.900
and also what it is to be a CS to 30 students in fall 2018.

788
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:57.010
So the course online is structured into five chapters or sub courses,

789
00:48:58.911 --> 00:49:02.870
let's say,
uh,
which we will teach you first is what is in Europe.

790
00:49:03.410 --> 00:49:06.320
You need to know that after understanding what the neuron is,

791
00:49:06.321 --> 00:49:08.990
you're going to be layers with this new roads.

792
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:12.800
You're then going to stuck these layers on top of each other to build a network

793
00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:17.520
that can be small or did,
uh,
this is the first course.
Unfortunately,

794
00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:21.530
it's not enough to deploy a network.
Uh,

795
00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:25.550
just just building a neural network is not enough to get it to work.

796
00:49:25.830 --> 00:49:26.870
So in the second course,

797
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:31.580
we're going to teach you the methods that are used to tune these network in

798
00:49:31.581 --> 00:49:36.000
order to improve their performances.
This is the second part.
Um,

799
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:40.330
as Andrew mentioned,
one thing we really,
uh,

800
00:49:41.110 --> 00:49:46.110
we think a huge emphasis on incest two 30 is the industrial applications and how

801
00:49:47.181 --> 00:49:48.160
the industry works today.

802
00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.100
So the third course is going to help you understand how to strategize your

803
00:49:52.101 --> 00:49:55.160
project that you do to find the quarter,
but also in general,

804
00:49:55.161 --> 00:49:58.610
how do a I teams work?
You can have an algorithm,

805
00:49:58.611 --> 00:50:01.460
you have to identify why does the algorithm work,

806
00:50:01.461 --> 00:50:04.070
why does it not work and if it doesn't work,

807
00:50:04.071 --> 00:50:07.130
what are the parts that you should improve inside the algorithm?

808
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:11.960
The two last courses of course forth and of course four and five are focusing on

809
00:50:11.961 --> 00:50:15.980
two fields that are defined by two types of algorithms.

810
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:20.360
First convolutional neural networks that have been proven to work very well on

811
00:50:20.420 --> 00:50:22.970
imaging or videos.

812
00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:27.200
And on the other hand sequence models that include also record your own
networks.

813
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:28.700
There's whore applied,

814
00:50:28.701 --> 00:50:32.060
the lots in natural language processing or speech recognition.

815
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:37.430
So you're going to see all that.
Uh,
from the online perspective.

816
00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:41.240
Um,
we use a specific notation in cs two 30.

817
00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:46.520
So when I will say c two m three,
it refers to course to module three.

818
00:50:46.850 --> 00:50:51.170
So the third module of improving deep neural networks.
Okay.

819
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.420
And I'd like everyone to go on the website to 30 syllabus after the class to

820
00:50:56.421 --> 00:51:01.310
look at all the syllabus revived the quarter check when the midterm is and when

821
00:51:01.311 --> 00:51:05.990
the final poster presentation,
um,
the schedule is posted there.

822
00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:10.460
Um,
so check it out and we're going to use the coarser applied form as you know.

823
00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:16.240
So on Coursera you will receive an invite on your Stanford email and you should

824
00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:19.730
have received it already for course.
One.

825
00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:23.510
In order to access the platform from the platform,

826
00:51:23.511 --> 00:51:26.840
you will be able to watch videos,
do quizzes,
and do programming assignments.

827
00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:30.890
And every time we finish one of these courses,
so c one has four modules.

828
00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:32.750
When you're at c one m four,

829
00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:36.650
you will receive a new invite to access CE two and so on.
Okay.

830
00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:38.790
Insights.

831
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:42.380
[inaudible] we're going to use [inaudible] as a class form for you to interact

832
00:51:42.381 --> 00:51:44.680
with the Tas and we,
the instructors.
Uh,

833
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:47.690
you can post privately or publicly depending on the matter.

834
00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.200
Okay.

835
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:55.940
So let's see what it is to be a one week in the life of the CSC to 30 students.

836
00:51:55.941 --> 00:51:59.180
So we're going to do 10 times that over this,
the fall quarter.

837
00:51:59.690 --> 00:52:04.690
So what is one module in a module you will watch about 10 videos on Coursera,

838
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:07.750
which will be about one hour and a half a.

839
00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.570
You will do quizzes after watching the videos.

840
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.150
This is going to take you about 20 minutes per module.

841
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:17.000
And finally you will complete programming assignments,

842
00:52:17.001 --> 00:52:19.430
which are on Jupiter notebooks.

843
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:24.380
You will get sales to test your code and also submit your code directly on the

844
00:52:24.381 --> 00:52:25.214
course of our platform.

845
00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:30.770
In one week of class in Stanford here we will have two modules.

846
00:52:31.310 --> 00:52:34.340
Usually on top of these two modules,

847
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:38.510
you will come to lecture for one hour and a half,
uh,

848
00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.430
in class lecture on an advanced topic that is not taught online.
And after that,

849
00:52:43.630 --> 00:52:44.090
uh,

850
00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:48.920
you will have ta sections on Fridays that are around one hour and it's a good

851
00:52:48.921 --> 00:52:51.060
chance for you to meet other students,
uh,

852
00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:55.610
for your projects and also to interact with the tas directly.
Um,
finally,

853
00:52:55.611 --> 00:53:00.560
we have also a personalized monitorship this quarter where every one of you will

854
00:53:00.561 --> 00:53:05.540
meet 15 minutes per week with a ta in order to check in on your projects and

855
00:53:05.541 --> 00:53:06.440
gives you the next steps.

856
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:10.460
So we put a huge emphasis on the project in this class and we want you,

857
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:14.480
you will see it later to build two to the side of your teams by this Friday.

858
00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:16.880
In order to get started as soon as possible,

859
00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:21.860
next week you will have your first mentorship meeting with the TS.

860
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:25.820
Okay.
It's going to be fun.
Um,

861
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:30.750
assignments and quizzes that are part of modules or do you every Wednesday at

862
00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:35.550
11:00 AM so 30 minutes before class so you can come to class with everything

863
00:53:35.551 --> 00:53:38.550
done and uh,
understanding,
uh,

864
00:53:38.551 --> 00:53:42.270
and do not follow the deadlines displayed on the Coursera Platform.

865
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:45.900
Follow the deadlines posted on the CS,
two 30 websites.

866
00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:48.960
The reason the deadlines are different is because we want to allow you to have

867
00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:52.380
laid days and course was not being poor late days.
So we,

868
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.520
we put the deadlines later on of course,

869
00:53:54.521 --> 00:53:57.430
search to allow you to submit even if you,
you want to use a late day.

870
00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.700
Does that make sense?
Okay.

871
00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:05.250
So we're also using a kind of interactive,
uh,
this,

872
00:54:05.251 --> 00:54:07.140
this is going to start course too.
We,

873
00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.890
we will use an interactive tool that is called Mentimeter,
um,

874
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:16.350
to checking attendance in class and also for you to answer some interactive

875
00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:21.060
questions.
So he's going to start,
uh,
next,
next week,
sorry.
Not Course to

876
00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:26.400
uh,
regarding the grading formula.
Uh,
here it is.

877
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.540
So you have a small part on attendance that is 2% of the final grade,

878
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:32.730
8% on quizzes,

879
00:54:32.731 --> 00:54:37.731
25% on programming assignments and a big part on the midterm and on the final

880
00:54:38.311 --> 00:54:43.230
projects.
Um,
so this is posted on the website if you want to check it.

881
00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:48.230
Uh,
attendance is taken for in class lectures for,
uh,

882
00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:52.410
15 minutes,
ca meetings and for the ta sections on Friday,

883
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:56.590
you can have a bonus.
And we've had students very active on,

884
00:54:56.591 --> 00:54:59.700
on Piazza that's answered questions to other students,

885
00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:03.570
which was great and they got a bonus.
So I encourage you to do the same.

886
00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:08.760
Maybe we don't need tas and instructors anyway.
Okay?

887
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:14.310
So I wanted to take a little more time to go over some of the programming

888
00:55:14.311 --> 00:55:18.070
assignments that you're going to do this quarter.
Um,
so that you,
you,

889
00:55:18.071 --> 00:55:21.930
you know where you're going in about three weeks from now,

890
00:55:22.350 --> 00:55:26.850
you're going to be able to translate these pictures here in the numbers that

891
00:55:26.851 --> 00:55:30.180
they correspond to in,
in sign languages.
So it's sign language,

892
00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:33.980
trust translation from images to the outputs,

893
00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.020
a signification,
um,

894
00:55:37.050 --> 00:55:39.510
you're going to build a convolutional neural network,
uh,

895
00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.630
and the first to logistic regression and then a convolutional neural network.

896
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:44.260
In order to solve this problem

897
00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:49.890
a little later,
you're going to be,
uh,

898
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:53.850
a deep learning engineer in a house that is not too far from here called the

899
00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:54.684
happy house.

900
00:55:55.290 --> 00:56:00.290
So there's only one rule in this house and the rule is that no sad person should

901
00:56:00.391 --> 00:56:01.890
enter the house should avoid that.

902
00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:05.250
And because you're the only deep learning engineer that has the knowledge,

903
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:08.580
you're given this task,
which is don't let these sad people in,

904
00:56:08.581 --> 00:56:13.581
just let happy people and you're going to build the network that will run on a

905
00:56:14.011 --> 00:56:18.660
camera that is in front of the house and that is going to let people in or not.

906
00:56:18.661 --> 00:56:22.080
And unfortunately some people will not get in and other people will,

907
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:26.470
will get in because they're happy and you will save to whup your house at the

908
00:56:26.471 --> 00:56:31.120
end of the assignment hopefully.
Um,
this is uh,
uh,

909
00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:36.121
one of the applications of deep learning that I personally prefer.

910
00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.610
It's called,
uh,
object detection.
You,
you might have heard of it.

911
00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:43.390
So this is running real time and that that's what he's very pressing.

912
00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:48.690
You're going to work on a deep learning architecture called Yolo v two and Yolo

913
00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:54.250
Vitu is an object detection algorithm that runs real time and is able to,

914
00:56:54.251 --> 00:56:59.110
they take 9,000 objects as fast as that.
So it's,
it's really,

915
00:56:59.111 --> 00:57:01.180
really impressive.
You have a few links here.

916
00:57:01.181 --> 00:57:02.740
If you want to check the paper already,

917
00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:07.630
but maybe you will need it some weeks to understand it.
Okay.

918
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:16.900
Actually we have,
uh,
we can even run it directly on my computer.

919
00:57:16.901 --> 00:57:19.120
I think she's going to be fun.

920
00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:38.190
Oh yeah,
we can run.
It's so he did you see it's running live on this computer.

921
00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:40.410
And so you see that if I move,
it's,

922
00:57:40.411 --> 00:57:45.030
we'll find out that I moved so I cannot escape.
Yeah,
here it is.
Okay.

923
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.823
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

924
00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:55.490
<v 4>Okay.
A few other projects.
Uh,
one,
two weeks from now,</v>

925
00:57:55.820 --> 00:57:59.440
you will build an optimal goalkeeper shoot prediction.
So in soccer,

926
00:57:59.460 --> 00:58:02.090
you're a goalkeeper and you want to decide where you should shoot them all in

927
00:58:02.091 --> 00:58:06.680
order to make it land on one of your teammates.
You're getting two signs.

928
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:09.050
What's the exact line on the field?

929
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:13.770
Which tabs that will keep our word to shoot two weeks from now about,
um,

930
00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:17.030
in the,
in the fourth course,
a convolutional neural network,

931
00:58:17.031 --> 00:58:20.630
you're going to work on car detection.
So this is a bigger image.
Uh,

932
00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.790
this is exactly the programming assignments.

933
00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:27.560
So we're going to work on the autonomous driving application that is finding

934
00:58:27.561 --> 00:58:30.710
cars,
finding stop signs,
finding lights,

935
00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:35.840
finding pedestrians and all the objects that are related to road features.
Okay,

936
00:58:35.930 --> 00:58:38.930
this is pretty cool and you will generate these images yourself.

937
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:43.910
So this is a picture taken from a camera in the front of,
uh,

938
00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:48.440
of a car and was,
was generated by drive that Ai,

939
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:51.063
um,

940
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:56.060
you will have a face recognition system that is going to first do face

941
00:58:56.061 --> 00:58:59.450
verification.
Is this person,

942
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:03.440
is this person the right person,
but also face recognition.
Who is this person,

943
00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:07.040
which is a little more complex.
We're going to go over that together,

944
00:59:07.430 --> 00:59:11.780
both online and in lecture or generation.
Some of you have heard of this.

945
00:59:12.050 --> 00:59:15.200
It's an algorithm called neural style transfer.
And again,
we usually put the,

946
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:16.580
the papers,
uh,

947
00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:19.970
at the bottom of the slides in case you want to check him yourself for your

948
00:59:19.971 --> 00:59:24.290
projects.
Uh,
but this is a problem where you give the contents image,

949
00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:26.600
which is the Golden Gate Bridge and the style image,

950
00:59:26.601 --> 00:59:31.520
which is an image that was painted usually by someone or an image from which you

951
00:59:31.521 --> 00:59:35.690
want to extract this style.
This algorithm is going to generate a new image,

952
00:59:36.500 --> 00:59:41.180
is going to mix the contents of the first image with the style of the second

953
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:45.800
image
music generation,
which is super fun.

954
00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:51.220
You're going to generate jazz music in the fifth course sequence models.

955
00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.800
You going in the same course also generate texts by giving a huge corpus written

956
00:59:57.741 --> 01:00:02.120
by Shakespeare a long time ago of poems.
You're going to teach the algorithm to,

957
01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:06.350
to generate poems as if it was written by Shakespeare.

958
01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:09.290
So you can even write the first sentence is going to continue.

959
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.690
And what g Phi,
you all have smartphones.

960
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:17.650
And I guess your notes is that when you write a sentence on your smartphone,
uh,

961
01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:21.110
each usually tells you what you should put next.
And sometimes it's an Emoji.

962
01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.280
You going to do this part,

963
01:00:22.281 --> 01:00:25.700
you're going to implement the algorithm that takes an input sentence and tells

964
01:00:25.701 --> 01:00:28.430
you what's the Emoji that that should come after it.

965
01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:31.310
Machine translation is,
uh,

966
01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:37.420
is one of the application that has been tremendously performing well with deep

967
01:00:38.451 --> 01:00:39.284
learning.

968
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:43.700
You're going to implement not to a full machine translation from one language to

969
01:00:43.701 --> 01:00:48.270
another,
but a similar task that is as exciting,
which is uh,

970
01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.610
changing human readable dates to machine readable dates.
So,
you know,

971
01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.170
let's say you're,
you're,
you're,

972
01:00:54.171 --> 01:00:58.700
you're filling in a form and you're typing a date.
The,
the,
the NTT that's,

973
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:00.170
that gathers this data.

974
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:03.680
We'll have a hard time convert all these dates into a specific format.

975
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:06.380
You're going to implement the algorithm that he's going to take all these

976
01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:10.610
different data in different formats and generate the right format translated to

977
01:01:10.611 --> 01:01:13.460
human from human readable to machine readable data.

978
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:17.840
And finally trigger word detection that I also love.
And,

979
01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:23.180
and some of you have have seen us build this algorithm,
uh,
a year ago,
I believe,

980
01:01:23.290 --> 01:01:27.710
uh,
which was which unison and Andrew and I have,
I've worked on,
um,

981
01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.620
trigger word detection is a problem of detecting a single word.
So,
you know,
you,

982
01:01:32.621 --> 01:01:34.120
you,
you probably have,
uh,

983
01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:39.280
objects from big companies that detect the voice and activate themselves under a

984
01:01:40.131 --> 01:01:44.050
trigger word.
You're going to build this algorithm for the trigger word activate.

985
01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:48.860
Yeah.
And many more projects that you will see.

986
01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:53.030
Now,
these are the things that you will all build in this course.

987
01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.150
Every one of you will build it through programming assignments,

988
01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:00.470
but you also have to choose your own projects to work on throughout the course.

989
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.980
And these are example of projects that CSU 30 students have,

990
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:07.550
have built in the past,
which have worked very well.

991
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:13.070
One is coloring black and white pictures using a neural network into new color

992
01:02:13.071 --> 01:02:14.240
representation of these features.

993
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:18.590
So it's pretty cool because we can now watch a movies that were,

994
01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.120
that were filmed in the 1930s or 1950s,
or I dunno,
when,
uh,
in color,

995
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:29.220
which is super cool.
Uh,
predicting a price of an object from a picture.

996
01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:32.400
So this was a great project in the first iteration of sis to 30,

997
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:37.230
where you give it a bike and the neural network guests is how much is the bike?

998
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:41.550
So if you want to sell stuff,
you don't know how much it just give it,

999
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:45.270
then you sell it at the price.
Uh,

1000
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:49.560
the students had actually implemented an algorithm to see which features of the

1001
01:02:49.561 --> 01:02:51.570
bike or related to the price.

1002
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:56.610
So it was super fun to see if it's the steering wheel or if it's the wheels or

1003
01:02:56.611 --> 01:03:00.000
if it's the body of the bike that makes this bike expensive according to the

1004
01:03:00.001 --> 01:03:04.710
algorithm.
And many more.
So last quarter specifically,

1005
01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:08.280
we've had a lot of projects in physics and uh,

1006
01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:12.510
and astrophysics and chemical engineering and mechanics,
which was great.
Uh,

1007
01:03:12.590 --> 01:03:15.210
some examples are detecting earthquake procure.

1008
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:18.210
So signals with a sequence model

1009
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:24.780
predicting the atom energy based on the atomic structure of an atom.
So you have,

1010
01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:26.190
you have for instance,

1011
01:03:26.270 --> 01:03:30.750
a softwares that run that are really computationally expensive that look at the

1012
01:03:30.751 --> 01:03:35.430
atomic structure of an atom and we'll output the energy of this item.

1013
01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:36.450
This takes a long time.

1014
01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:41.070
These students have tried to make it a three second problem by running on your

1015
01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:42.680
own network to find the energy of the atom.

1016
01:03:43.010 --> 01:03:47.490
So you have a bunch of problem across industries.
So healthcare,
cancer,
parking,

1017
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:50.930
stone,
Alzheimer detection.
We've had a lot of these,
we've had rain tomorrow.

1018
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:55.360
Segmentation.
Segmentation is a problem of on an image classifier.

1019
01:03:55.370 --> 01:03:59.280
Every Pixel tell me which speaks all correspond to the tumor for example.

1020
01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:05.570
So we were really excited to see what you guys are going to build at the end of

1021
01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:09.390
this quarter and that's why we want you to build your teams very quickly get

1022
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:13.680
started because the project is what you should be proud of at the end of the

1023
01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.790
quarter.
We hope that you guys,

1024
01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:17.100
we've come at the poster session proud of your poster,

1025
01:04:17.101 --> 01:04:19.650
proud of the final project that you sent us,

1026
01:04:19.651 --> 01:04:23.250
and you can talk about it in the 10 x years or 20 next years,
hopefully.

1027
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:29.880
And I guess Andrew Can,
can,
can come from that.
A CSU to nine students from the,

1028
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.560
the few past years have done projects that are amazing today and have been

1029
01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:39.540
featured,
uh,
around the world as a research or,
or,
or industrial project.

1030
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.060
So to sum up in this course,
you will build a wide range of applications.

1031
01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:49.840
Uh,
it's very applied.
There was some math,
but less than cs,
two to tonight,

1032
01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:51.970
more than six,
two,
two,
nine,
eight.
Uh,

1033
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.200
and you have access to personalized mentorship thanks to the amazing ta team and

1034
01:04:58.861 --> 01:05:00.410
the instructors.
Um,

1035
01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:06.900
and finally we'll have to build a 10 week long project.

1036
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:12.930
So now we get to the serious thing.
What is,
uh,
what we are up to this week.

1037
01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.680
So at the end of every lecture you'll have one slide that's going to remind you

1038
01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.710
what have to do for next week.
Uh,
next Wednesday,
11:00 AM.

1039
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.250
So create your course there.
I accounts based on the invite that you receive.

1040
01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:28.300
If you didn't receive any invite,
send it as a private post on cards are,

1041
01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.290
we will send it again,

1042
01:05:29.620 --> 01:05:34.620
finish the two first modules of course one c one m one and c one and two.

1043
01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:38.530
It corresponds to two quizzes and to programming assignments and around 20

1044
01:05:38.531 --> 01:05:39.730
videos.
Okay.

1045
01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:44.760
Which are sit here and for Friday it means two days from now by the end of the

1046
01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.960
day,
uh,
find project he mates and uh,

1047
01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:53.630
fill in the form to tell us who are your teammates is going to help us find your

1048
01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:55.360
mentor.
Um,

1049
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:59.880
finally there is a ta section also this Friday,
no project mentorship.

1050
01:05:59.881 --> 01:06:04.120
It would start next week.
Um,
but we,
we will see you on Friday.

1051
01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.620
I'm going to take a few questions.
Should have about yes,

1052
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:13.590
yeah.
These days what people said at the end of the stars.

1053
01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.700
So the ta sections,
we're going have a large range of ta section on Friday.

1054
01:06:20.701 --> 01:06:23.600
So there's going to meet basically every time you are going to be assigned to

1055
01:06:23.601 --> 01:06:28.020
one of them.
And if you want to move,
you can send an email as a PR,

1056
01:06:28.270 --> 01:06:31.400
a Pr Zappos privately to ask to be moved to another section.

1057
01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.160
How big is the team?
Usually it's from one to three students.
Exceptionally.

1058
01:06:40.161 --> 01:06:44.840
We would accept of four students if the project is challenging enough.
Yeah.

1059
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:50.600
Yes.
So,
uh,

1060
01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:54.080
it is possible to combine the project with other classes in,

1061
01:06:54.081 --> 01:06:57.650
it's been done in the past.
Uh,
what we want is you to,

1062
01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:03.400
to give a project and a poster that that is framed as cs two 31 seat to be frank

1063
01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:08.750
and you discuss with us in order for us to validate if you can merge this

1064
01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:12.200
project with another class because it requires to have deep yearning.
Of course,

1065
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.500
you're not supposed to combine this project with something that doesn't have

1066
01:07:15.630 --> 01:07:18.300
turning it off.
Okay.

1067
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.983
One more question.

1068
01:07:27.450 --> 01:07:31.640
Can we take quizzes so you can,
you can retake the quizzes as much as you want.

1069
01:07:31.641 --> 01:07:33.300
Then of course,
Sarah,
uh,

1070
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:37.680
we will consider the last submitted quiz for this class.
Okay.

1071
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:42.030
So you can resubmit if you didn't get full way.
Yeah.
Okay.

1072
01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.950
Thanks guys and see you on Friday.
