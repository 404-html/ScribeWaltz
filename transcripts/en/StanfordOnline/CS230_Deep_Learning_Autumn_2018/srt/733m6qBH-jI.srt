1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,780
Um, okay. Hey, everyone looks
like we're on a, so as usual,

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,090
if you have not yet,
um,

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,980
please enter your suid so that
we know you're here in this room.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,990
Um, so I should compete for him.
He, okay. The back is it okay?

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,660
Oh yes. Is the volume okay? Are the
back all right? No one's responding.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,700
Yes. Okay. All right.
Thank you. Okay, so, um,

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,020
what are the ones to do today
is share a you two things.

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,340
You know,
we're approaching the end of the course.

9
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:43,400
There are a hope you guys looking
forward to the Thanksgiving break. Um,

10
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,570
next week, um, Ashley and I
guess we were La home viewers,

11
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:49,870
but those of us does do that.
Viewing this from outside California.

12
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:53,270
I know that we're all feeling really bad
air here in California. I said, Whoa,

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,080
there's some of you are watching this at
home yet. That's a air wherever you are.

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,900
Um, uh, but um,

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:04,470
well to do today is give you some advice
that will set you up for the future of

16
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:05,510
stuff.

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:10,510
Even beyond the conclusion of cs two 30
and in particular one on one to do today

18
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,100
is share with view some advice on
how to read research papers. Uh,

19
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:16,571
because you know,

20
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:20,300
deep down is evolving fast enough
that even though you've learned law,

21
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,180
the foundations of deep learning,

22
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:25,600
I learned a lot of the tips and tricks
then you probably know better than many

23
00:01:25,601 --> 00:01:29,480
practitioners. How's it as you can do
going out rooms to work already. Um,

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,020
when you're working on specific
applications where doing comms division on

25
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:37,100
national falsing let's be
recognition or something else, um,

26
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:42,100
for you to be able to efficiently figure
out the academic literature on key

27
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:46,300
parts of the deep learning world will
help you keep on developing and you know,

28
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:51,130
staying on top of ideas
even as they evolve over the
next several years or maybe

29
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,240
decades. So firstly we want to do
is, um, give you advice on how, uh,

30
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:58,850
when say when I'm trying to
master a new body of literature,

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,130
how I go about that and hope that those
techniques will be useful to help you be

32
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:05,620
more efficient. How you
read research papers. Um,

33
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,730
and then the second thing is in
previous offerings of this cost,

34
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,970
one request from a lot of students was
just advice for navigating a career in

35
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,800
machine learning.
And so in the second half of today,

36
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,990
I want to share some thoughts
with you on that. Okay. Um,

37
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,600
so it turns out that,

38
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,760
so I guess too is how pigs meeting
besides papers, right? And, um,

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:35,470
and then second career advice in
machine learning. So turns out that,

40
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:36,304
um,

41
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:40,743
okay.

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,060
You know,
reading besides papers,

43
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:47,170
this one of those things that a lot of
phd students learn via Osmosis, right?

44
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,290
Meaning that if you're a phd
student and you see, you know,

45
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,080
a few professors will see other phd
students do sorts of the things that he

46
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:55,090
might try to pick it up by Osmosis.

47
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:59,740
But I hope today to a celebrate your
efficiency and how you acquiring all this

48
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:03,790
yourself from DOL, from the
academic literature. Right?

49
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,480
And so, um, then I say that this
an area you want to become good at.

50
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:11,270
Let's say you want to build that
speech recognition. Alright,

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,270
just turns it off for now. Let's
see. You want to build that to him?

52
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,340
Speech recognition system that we
talked about it cause they're Robert's,

53
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:22,410
her and all. And then the desk lamp,
right? Um, this is what I read.

54
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:26,350
There's a sequence of steps I
recommend you take on, which is first

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:36,040
Kampala, this papers. Um, and uh, and,

56
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,790
and by papers I mean both research
papers often posted on archive,

57
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:43,620
on the Internet, but also
plus medium pose. Um,

58
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,133
okay.

59
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,640
Yeah, Wah. Maybe some okays get helped
poses though those are rare raw. Uh,

60
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,050
but whatever texts or learning
resources you have. And then, um,

61
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,410
what I usually do is end up
skipping around in this, right?

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,600
So if I'm trying to master
a new body of knowledge,

63
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,460
so you want learn about
speech recognition systems,

64
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:08,650
this is what it feels like
to read a set of papers,

65
00:04:08,651 --> 00:04:13,651
which is maybe you initially
start off with five papers.

66
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,960
And if on the horizontal axis I plot,
you know,

67
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:21,820
0% to 100% red slash.

68
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,940
Understood, right? Um,

69
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:29,990
the way it feels like reading these
papers is often I'll read, you know,

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,540
10% of each paper or I try to quickly
skim and understanding each of these

71
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:39,520
papers. And if based on that you
decide that paper number two is a dud,

72
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,490
right? Other, other, other
authors, even Satan and say, boy,

73
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:45,190
they sure they show it wrong, will you
be there? It just doesn't make sense.

74
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,310
Then go ahead and forget it. And as you
skip around to different papers, uh,

75
00:04:50,311 --> 00:04:55,060
you might decide that paper
three is they're really
seminar one and then spend a

76
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:59,080
lot of time to go ahead and read
and understand the whole thing.

77
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,610
And based on that,

78
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:05,611
you might then find a six paper from the
citations and read that and go back and

79
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:07,900
flesh or your understanding of paper for,

80
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,010
and then find the paper seven and go and
read that all the way to the conclusion.

81
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,250
Um, but this is what it
feels like as you, you know,

82
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,420
assemble and lists of papers and skipping
around and they try to, um, uh, uh,

83
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,560
monster, a body of literature right
around some topic that you want to learn.

84
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:27,970
And I think, um, some
rough guidelines, you know,

85
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,720
if Your View 50th to 20 papers, I think
you have a basic understanding of a,

86
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:35,410
of an area, right? So let me, I was
like maybe good enough to do some work,

87
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,900
apply some algorithms.
Um,

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:42,420
if you read 50 to a hundred papers in
an area like speech recognition and,

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,020
and kind of understanding a lot of it,

90
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,920
then that's part of the enough to give
you a very good understanding of an area.

91
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,920
Right? You, you might,
I don't know, I'm, I,

92
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:53,350
I'm as careful about when I say
like you mastering a subject,

93
00:05:53,351 --> 00:05:55,390
but you're beat 50 a hundred
papers on speech recognition.

94
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:58,220
You had a very good understanding,
uh, speech recognition. Oh,

95
00:05:58,221 --> 00:06:01,130
if you're interested in say,
domain at that station, right?

96
00:06:01,131 --> 00:06:02,970
By the time you've read
50 or a hundred papers,

97
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,720
do you have a very good understanding of,
of a subject like that?

98
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,350
But they read five to 20 papers. It's
probably enough for you to implement it,

99
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,310
but maybe not,

100
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:13,190
not sure if there's enough for you to
do research or be really at the cutting

101
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:13,461
edge.

102
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:18,230
But these are maybe some guidelines for
the volume of reading you should aspire

103
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:19,940
to if you want to pick up a new area.

104
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,870
But I'll take one association and cs two
30 and go more deeply into it. Right.

105
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,390
Um,
no.

106
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:35,540
How do you read one paper? And, um, I
hope most of you brought your laptop.

107
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:40,541
So what I'm going to do is describe to
you how I read one paper and then after

108
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:44,210
that I'm actually going to ask all of you
to, you know, download the paper online.

109
00:06:44,211 --> 00:06:48,430
They just take, I'll know, uh,
uh, take, take a few minutes of,

110
00:06:48,431 --> 00:06:52,580
read a paper right here in class and
see how far you can get understanding of

111
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:56,420
research paper in just minutes.
Right, right here in class. Okay. Um,

112
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,450
so when reading one paper,

113
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:04,690
so the bad way to read the paper is to
go from the first word until the last

114
00:07:04,721 --> 00:07:08,210
word, right. This is a bad way to when
you want, you have a paper like this. Oh,

115
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:12,400
and by the way, Ashley here and tell
you what my real life is like. So, um,

116
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:17,810
I actually pretty much everywhere I go,
whenever I backpack,

117
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,080
this is my actual fo there.
Um, I don't want to show,

118
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,040
this is my actual folder of unread paper.
So pretty much everywhere I go,

119
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,930
I actually have a paper, a stack of
papers is on my personal reading lists.

120
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,990
This is actually my real life.
I didn't bring this to show you.

121
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,740
This isn't like that pat all the time.
Uh, and I think that, I don't know,

122
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,650
these days I'm on my team
at landing Ain t blinder AI.

123
00:07:40,651 --> 00:07:44,360
I personally lead in reading group where
I lead a discussion about two papers a

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:44,991
week.
Uh,

125
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:48,650
but to select two papers and means I need
to eat like five or six papers a week

126
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:53,650
to select to, you know, to present or
discuss at the [inaudible] meeting group.

127
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:55,040
So this is my real life.
Right?

128
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,250
And how I tried to stay on top
of the pitcher show and I have a,

129
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,580
I'm doing a lot if I can find this fine,
if I can find the time to beat, you know,

130
00:08:01,581 --> 00:08:05,460
a couple of papers will be
hopefully all of you can to, um, uh,

131
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,920
but when I'm reading a paper,
this is,

132
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,860
this is how I would
recommend you go about it,

133
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:13,610
which is don't go from the first or,
and they read until the last word. Um,

134
00:08:13,611 --> 00:08:17,150
instead up tick multiple
passes through the paper.

135
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,800
Right. Um, and so, you know, step one is a

136
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,840
we the title,

137
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,460
the abstract

138
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,360
and also the figures. Um,
especially in the deep learning,

139
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,310
there are a lot of research papers where
stuff, the entire paper is summarize it,

140
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:49,460
one or two fingers and they
figure captions. So, um,

141
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,600
so sometimes just by reading
the title abstract and you know,

142
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:57,090
the key neural network architecture
figure that just describes what the whole

143
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:59,520
papers out and maybe one or
two of the experiments section,

144
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:03,630
you can sometimes get a very good sense
of what the whole paper is about without

145
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,510
hardly reading any of the texts
in their pay for itself. Right?

146
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,230
That's the first pass.
Second Pass.

147
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,270
I would tend to read more carefully

148
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,040
the intro to conclusions.
Um,

149
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,360
look carefully at all the fingers again

150
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,450
and then skim the rest. And you know,

151
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,060
um, I don't know how many of you are
publish academic papers, but, uh,

152
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,880
when people publish academic
papers, um, part of, you know,

153
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,150
the publication process is convincing
the reviewers that your paper is worthy

154
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:43,070
for a sentence.

155
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,070
And so what you find is that the abstract
ensuring conclusion is often when the

156
00:09:48,331 --> 00:09:50,490
authors tried to summarize
their work really,

157
00:09:50,491 --> 00:09:55,440
really carefully to make a case to make
a really clear case to the review as to

158
00:09:55,441 --> 00:09:58,350
why they think their paper should
be accepted for publication.

159
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,720
And so because of that,
you know,

160
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,810
maybe slightly not
slightly unusual incentive,

161
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:07,770
the intro and conclusion and abstract
often give a very clear summary of what's

162
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:12,650
the paper actually about.
Um, and depending on,

163
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,710
um,
and again,

164
00:10:19,711 --> 00:10:23,170
just be bluntly honest with you guys.
Um,

165
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,880
the related work section is useful
if you want. It's sometimes useful.

166
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:30,380
You want to do understand related
work and figure out what's,

167
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:32,280
what are the most important
works in the papers.

168
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,780
But the first time you read this you
might skim or even skip skim the related

169
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:39,420
work section. And it turns out, unless
you're already from early literature,

170
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,960
if this is a body of net worth that
you're not that familiar with the related

171
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:47,220
work section is sometimes almost
impossible to understand. Uh, and again,

172
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,020
since I'm being very honest with you guys,

173
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:52,680
sometimes the related work section is
when the authors tried to say everyone

174
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:56,610
that could possibly be reviewing the
paper and to make them a few good and then

175
00:10:56,611 --> 00:11:00,030
hopefully accepted paper if it's a related
work sections and sometimes written

176
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:04,560
in funny ways, right? Um, and then, uh,

177
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:08,190
set three.
I would often read the paper,

178
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,630
but I'm just skip the math.

179
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,980
Right. Um, and for wheat, the whole thing,

180
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,630
but skip pass,
it don't make sense,

181
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:42,630
you know? Um, I think that uh,

182
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,190
one thing that's happened many
times in their research is that,

183
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,010
I mean the papers,
we tend to be cutting edge research.

184
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,860
And so when we publish things,

185
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:56,920
we sometimes don't know what's really
important. It was not important. Right?

186
00:11:56,921 --> 00:12:00,700
So there,
there are many examples of well known,

187
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:04,360
highly cited research papers,
whereas some of it was just great stuff.

188
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:06,970
And some of it, you know,
turned out to be unimportant.

189
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:08,620
But at the time to paypal has written,

190
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:12,520
the authors did not know every no one on
the planet knew what was important and

191
00:12:12,521 --> 00:12:17,200
what was not important. And maybe one
example, um, the, the net five paper,

192
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,540
right sound, no paper by Yonder
Quinn, part of it was phenomenal.

193
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,950
We just established a
lot of the foundations of
continents. Uh, and so it was,

194
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,720
it one of the most incredibly
influential papers.

195
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,440
But you'd go back and read that paper
and another sort of Ho half of the paper

196
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,470
was about other stuff, right?
Transducers and so on. Dennis,

197
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:37,180
much less use and so and so is fine if
you read a paper and some of it doesn't

198
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:40,990
make sense because it's not that unusual.
Well sometimes it just happens that, um,

199
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,380
great research means we're
publishing things are the
boundaries of our knowledge.

200
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,440
And sometimes, uh, the
stuff you see, you know,

201
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:50,710
we'll realize five years in the future
that that wasn't the most important thing

202
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,060
off there. All right. Well that the,

203
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,450
what was the key part of the Ahhbra
maybe wasn't what the author's thought.

204
00:12:55,451 --> 00:13:00,451
And so sometimes it pops paper don't make
sense is okay to skip it initially and

205
00:13:00,701 --> 00:13:03,040
move on. Right? So, uh, unless
you're trying to do a peak,

206
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,890
unless you're trying to do the research
and really you need to master it,

207
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,600
then go ahead and spend more time.

208
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,900
But they're trying to get through a lot
of the papers then, you know, then Dennis,

209
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:15,640
just prioritizing your
time. Okay. Um, and so,

210
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,250
uh,
just a few

211
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:25,240
last things and then I'll
ask you to practice this
yourself with a paper, right.

212
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,540
Um, you know, I think that when
you've read and understood the paper,

213
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,753
okay.

214
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,300
Decent questions to try to keep
in mind and when you eat a paper,

215
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,690
then a few minutes maybe and
try to answer these questions.

216
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,730
One thing you also has
tried to accomplish,

217
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:46,540
why the hope to do in a few minutes is
asking you to download the paper off the

218
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,410
Internet. We did. And then, um,

219
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,540
try to answer these questions and discuss
your answer to these questions with,

220
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,270
with your peers. Read with
others in the class. Okay. Um,

221
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,203
okay.

222
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,410
What were the key elements?

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,833
Okay.

224
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,880
What can you use yourself and,
um,

225
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,333
okay.

226
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,170
Okay. So I think of you
can answer these questions.

227
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:50,140
Hopefully that will reflect that you
have a pretty good understanding of the

228
00:14:50,141 --> 00:14:52,400
paper. Okay. Um,

229
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,730
and so what I would like you
to do is pull up your laptop.

230
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:03,590
And then, so you know, there's actually
a, so I think on the confident videos,

231
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:07,610
right on the Dev land,
our AI concept videos and Coursera,

232
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,370
you learned a bit about um,
uh,

233
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:15,170
various neural network architectures up
to it resonates and it turns out that

234
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:17,570
there's another,
a follow on piece of work.

235
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,820
There may be builds on some
of the ideas of resonance,

236
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:24,440
which is called dense nets. So
what I'd like you to do is, um, oh,

237
00:15:24,441 --> 00:15:29,180
and so when did I can do is actually try
this and when I'm reading a paper again

238
00:15:29,181 --> 00:15:31,280
in the earliest stages,
don't get stuck on the map.

239
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,730
Just go ahead and skim the math and the
English texts we get through faster. Uh,

240
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:39,830
and maybe one of the principles is go
from the very efficient high information

241
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:42,680
content for us and then go
to the harder material later.

242
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,500
It is why often now just skimmed a map.
And I don't,

243
00:15:45,501 --> 00:15:46,870
if I don't understand
the similar integration,

244
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,220
just move on and then they'll
only data go back and,

245
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,910
and really try to figure out
the map more carefree. Okay.

246
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:57,190
So one of the lecture they do is take
on a, why don't you take, um, uh,

247
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:01,340
uh, winter of uh, let's,
let's, let's try it. Let's,

248
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:04,190
let's have you take seven minutes
where I'm thinking maybe one,

249
00:16:04,191 --> 00:16:05,810
one minute per occasion,
quite fast.

250
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:09,260
And search for this paper,

251
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,190
densely connected.
Convolutional neural net, net

252
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,860
works by

253
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:27,980
Warhol as Oh, okay. Why should
I stick out your laptops?

254
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,270
A searcher. This paper, a download,
it is refined is on archive.

255
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,310
Um, ar XIV. Right. And uh, and it,

256
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,310
this is also something that you
also called his dense net. So yes.

257
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:47,660
Um, and go ahead and take, why
don't you take like seven minutes?

258
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:51,680
So we just paper and I'll let you
know when the time has passed.

259
00:16:51,681 --> 00:16:55,880
And then after that time,
um, I liked you to, you know,

260
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,660
discuss with your, with the
others, right. What, what,

261
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:01,910
what you think are the answers,
especially in the first two,

262
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,370
because the other two you can leave off.

263
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,860
Why don't you go ahead and take a few
minutes to do that now and then I'll let

264
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:08,430
you know when,
um,

265
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:12,260
so the like seven minutes of pass and
then you can discuss your answers with

266
00:17:12,261 --> 00:17:16,220
these with your friends.
Okay. All right guys. So,

267
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,353
um,

268
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:24,370
anyone with any thoughts or insights
or surprises or thoughts from this?

269
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,060
So now you've spent 11
minutes on this paper, right?

270
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:31,900
Seven minutes of eating for minutes.
Discussing is really,

271
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:36,500
really short period of time. But any,
any thoughts or do you think of the paper

272
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,360
going, you're, you're just spending lots
of counseling, offsetting each other.

273
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:50,310
W W what do people think of the time
you spend trying to read the paper?

274
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,150
Actually they should tell you how I
should raise your hand if you, a few of,

275
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:05,280
you know, you kind of understood the
main concepts in the camper just a bit,

276
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:11,920
2000 linear feet
and actually requesting to the figures.

277
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:21,600
Okay.

278
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,270
Wow. People are really less than average,
I think today than usual. Everyone.

279
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,150
So I think this is one of
those papers where, um, the,

280
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,230
the paper is almost, it's
how you summarize, uh,

281
00:18:37,231 --> 00:18:38,810
figures one and two,
right?

282
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,890
I think if you got to see a lot of people
now if you look at figure of one and

283
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:45,030
the caption the

284
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,840
on page three and the caption there
and understand those two figures,

285
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:53,460
those really convey, you know, 80%
of the idea of the paper. All right.

286
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:57,330
Um, and I think that uh, um,

287
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,920
a couple of other tips. So, um,

288
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,730
it turns out that as you read
these papers, what practice
you do get faster. So,

289
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:10,890
um, for example, table
one a on page four, right?

290
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,140
You know,
this mess of a table on top,

291
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:18,690
this is a pretty common format or a format
like this is how a lot of authors use

292
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,840
to distract a network architecture,
especially in computer vision.

293
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,980
So one of the things that
you find as well is that, um,

294
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,300
the first time you see
something like Table One,

295
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,680
it just looks really complicated.

296
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,630
But by the time you've read a few
papers in the similar format, you build,

297
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:35,670
look at Table One, then go, oh,
Yep, got it. Yeah, this is, this is,

298
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,460
this is the dentist at one 21%,
just one 69 architecture.

299
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,030
And be with them more quickly.
Pick up those things.

300
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:45,810
And so another thing you find is that
I'm meeting these papers actually gets

301
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:49,620
better with practice because you see
different authors use different ways on

302
00:19:49,621 --> 00:19:52,490
some of the ways of expressing themselves
and the kids used to that you guys

303
00:19:52,491 --> 00:19:56,220
should be faster and faster at
implementing these, um, at, at,

304
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:57,510
at understanding these ideas.

305
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,220
And I think these days we're not reading
a paper like this and maybe it takes me

306
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:04,350
about half an hour to two if you'd like.
And I,

307
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,980
I know I gave you guys seven minutes
when I thought I would need maybe half an

308
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,420
hour to figure out a people like this.
Uh, um, uh, and I think, uh, for a more,

309
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,750
I find that a,
it's not unusual for people,

310
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:19,870
relatively new to machine learning to
maybe an hour to kind of, you know,

311
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,330
really understand that paper like this.
Um,

312
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,480
and then I'll know I'm pretty experienced
machine learning and some downs have

313
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,290
maybe half an hour for people like this,
maybe even 20 minutes.

314
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,020
It was a really easy one, but there are
some outliers, so I have some colleagues,

315
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:35,280
so sometimes it stumped by crowds
are really difficult paper.

316
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:37,890
You need to chase a lot of
references and then love on this now.

317
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,000
So sometimes you come across a paper that
takes you three or four hours or even

318
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:44,550
longer to really understand it. But, uh,

319
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,120
but I think depending on how much
time do you want to spend probate,

320
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,110
reading papers, um, you could
actually learn, you know,
learn a lot rights, um, uh,

321
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,240
doing what you just did,

322
00:20:55,241 --> 00:20:59,170
but maybe spending half an opera paper
and our paper rather than seven minutes.

323
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,840
Right. Um, so, all right.

324
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,180
I feel like, uh, yeah, it was,

325
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:11,110
and notice that I've actually not said
anything about the content of this paper,

326
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,450
right? So whatever you guys
just learned, that was all you,

327
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:14,590
I had nothing to do with it.

328
00:21:14,591 --> 00:21:17,890
So you know that y'all have the ability
to go and learn this stuff by yourself.

329
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:19,090
You don't need me anymore.
Right.

330
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:27,980
So just a last few comments.
Um,

331
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,400
let's see. So the other few can, he'd ask
questions I get is, uh, you know, where,

332
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:33,234
where do you go?

333
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:40,510
The deep learning a few of evolves so
rapidly. So where, where do you go to?

334
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:42,610
So if you're trying to master
a new body of knowledge,

335
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,520
definitely do web searches and they're
often good blog posts on the, oh,

336
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:48,700
she had the most important
papers in speech recognition.

337
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:51,880
There are lots of great resources there.
And then the other thing you,

338
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,630
I don't know,

339
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,990
love people try one to do is try to
keep up with the state of yard of deep

340
00:21:55,991 --> 00:21:58,510
learning even as it's evolving rapidly.

341
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:03,430
And so I just tell you
where I go to keep up with,

342
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,660
um, you know, discussions, announcements,

343
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,460
a surprising the Twitter is becoming
an surprisingly important place for

344
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:12,870
researchers to find out about new things.
Um,

345
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:17,960
there's a m l sub reddit is
actually pretty good. Um,

346
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,570
lots of noise for many important
pieces of where do get mentioned there.

347
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,920
Some of the top machine learning
conferences are nips ICML

348
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:33,400
and I clear. All right. Uh, and so
whenever these conferences come around,

349
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,400
take a look and glance
through at least the title,

350
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,130
see if it's something that interests you.
And then I think, unfortunately, I guess,

351
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,480
um, friends, you know, um, uh, both
colleagues here at Stanford as,

352
00:22:43,481 --> 00:22:48,110
as colleagues to several of the
teams I work with that um, uh, uh,

353
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,710
that, just tell me where
there's a cool paper I guess,

354
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:53,710
but I think with here with in
Stanford or among your workplace,

355
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:57,970
for those of you taking this NSTP
DDP and form a community that shares

356
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,870
interesting papers.

357
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:02,800
So lot of the groups I have are on
slack and we regularly slack each other.

358
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,250
I'll send, send each other a text
messages on the slack messaging system.

359
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,200
We find interesting papers that,
that's been great for me actually. Um,

360
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,280
yeah. Oh, and, and
Twitter. Let's see. Ken Is,

361
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,200
I follow Keon you could follow him to,
this is me,

362
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,010
Andrew wine, right. Um, I prayed on
slack or papers as often as I do,

363
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:29,990
but if you look at, I don't know, you
can also look at who we follow them.

364
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,610
There are a lot of good researchers
that then we'll share all these things

365
00:23:33,611 --> 00:23:37,000
online. And um, there,
there's a bunch of people,

366
00:23:37,001 --> 00:23:41,990
they also use a website
called archive sanity. Um, I
don't ask much sometimes, um,

367
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:46,790
but, but loss of resources
like that. Great. Um,

368
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,973
cool.

369
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,670
So just two last tips for
how to be papers in good,

370
00:23:55,671 --> 00:23:59,120
good at this.
Um,

371
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:04,520
so it's a more deeply understand the
paper. Some of the papers will have

372
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:10,300
math in it and actually if Vieta I'll
know y'all learned about bashing.

373
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:13,760
All right. And uh, um, a
second module is videos.

374
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,880
If you read the bashing on paper is
actually one of the harder papers he read.

375
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,110
Um, uh, there's a lot of math
in the derivation of bashed. No,

376
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,020
but their papers like that. And if you
want to make sure you understand the math,

377
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:28,250
here's what I would recommend,
which is a read through it,

378
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,660
take detailed notes and then see if
you can read, derive it from scratch.

379
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:38,540
So if you want to deeply understand the
math of an algorithm, like, you know,

380
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,050
fashion or more the details
of backdrop or something. Um,

381
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,920
the good practice and I
think a lot of, um, uh, uh,

382
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,060
sort of a theory, a thorough company,
signs and mathematics PhD students,

383
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,880
we use a practice ideas which
just go ahead and read the paper,

384
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,610
make sure you understand it. And
then to Mitchell, you really,

385
00:24:55,611 --> 00:24:57,450
really understand it.
Put a p,

386
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,690
put aside the results and try to re
derive the math yourself from scratch.

387
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,020
And if you can start from a blank piece
of paper and read derived one of these

388
00:25:06,021 --> 00:25:09,080
algorithms and stretch. And that's a
good side and you really understood it.

389
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:13,380
When I was a phd student, I did this
a lot, right? Um, that, you know,

390
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,740
I would read a textbook or read the
paper or something and then put aside

391
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,000
whether I read and see if I could read
the revive it from scratch starting from

392
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:22,700
a blank piece of paper as only
if I could do that. Did I,

393
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,510
would you have a few like, Yep. I think
I understand this piece of math. Um,

394
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,760
and it turns out if you want me
to do this type of map yourself,

395
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:32,300
is your ability to derive
this type of math redirect,

396
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:35,870
this type of math that gives
you the ability to generalize,

397
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:38,270
to derive new novel
pieces of math yourself.

398
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,690
So I think I actually learned the after
math of several machine learning by

399
00:25:41,691 --> 00:25:45,830
doing this and this by the riving other
people's work that allowed me to learn

400
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:48,110
how to divide my own novel algorithms.

401
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,830
And actually sometimes you go
to the art galleries, right?

402
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:55,160
They go to the Smithsonian, you see,
these aren't students, you know,

403
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:58,870
sitting on the floor.
I'm copying the great artworks,

404
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,900
the great paintings painted by
the masses so centuries ago.

405
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,360
And so I think just as a today,

406
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:09,200
there are students sitting in or the
de Young Museum or whatever, every or,

407
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,070
and I was at the Getty Museum
in La a few months ago.

408
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,820
You actually see these aren't citizens,
you know, copying the work or the masters.

409
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:20,120
And I think a lot of the ways that
you want to become good at the math of

410
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:23,450
machine learning yourself, uh, this
is, this is a good way to do it.

411
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,940
It's time consuming, but then you
can become good at it that way.

412
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,220
And same thing for cones
rates. I think the, um, simple,

413
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,050
lightweight version one of learning would
be to download and run to open source

414
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:39,140
code if you can find it.

415
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:43,500
And a deeper way to learn this
material is to reimplement it scratch,

416
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,530
right?

417
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:54,240
It's easy to download an open source
thing and rather than this, Ooh, it works.

418
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:57,360
But if you can implement one
of these albums from scratch,

419
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,730
then that's a strong scientist you've
really understood. Does Alfred. Okay.

420
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,450
Um, all right. And then

421
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,470
longer term advice,

422
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,873
right?

423
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:28,470
You know, you'd say keep on learning
and keep on getting better and better.

424
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,260
The more important thing is
for you to learn steadily,

425
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:35,210
not for you to have a focus, intense
activity. You know, like, uh,

426
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,180
all the Thanksgiving you read 50 papers
over Thanksgiving and then you're done

427
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,400
for the rest of your life. It
doesn't work like that. Right.

428
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,050
And I think you actually much better our
reading to a few papers a week for the

429
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,250
next year then,
you know,

430
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:51,030
cramming everything right over over
one long weekend or something. Oh,

431
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,110
actually in education we're actually known
in the space repetition where I sweat

432
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:58,230
in the traveling. So, uh, the same,
same thing, same body of learning.

433
00:27:58,231 --> 00:28:00,570
If you learn a bit every
week and space it out,

434
00:28:00,571 --> 00:28:02,430
you actually have much
better long term retention.

435
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,960
Then you try to cram everything
in the short term. So does,

436
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:09,360
does a very solid result that we know
from pedagogy and how the human brain

437
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:13,680
world. So, so if you're able
to, um, so, so again, the way I,

438
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:17,550
my life is my backpack.
I just always have a few papers with me.

439
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:20,550
I'm going to find that again.
I've read almost everything on the tablet,

440
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,560
on almost everything on an iPad,

441
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:25,860
but they find that research papers and
all those things where the ability to

442
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:30,160
flip the team pages and skim, I still
find more efficient on paper. So, um,

443
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,110
I read almost nothing on paper these
days except for research papers.

444
00:28:34,111 --> 00:28:37,770
But that's just me. Your mileage may vary.
Maybe something else will work. Okay.

445
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,600
All right. Um, so let's see.
That's if I read a recent papers,

446
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,780
I hope that while you're in
CSU 30, you know, by the way,

447
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:48,260
if some of you find some cool papers,
I've you have,

448
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,840
go further for the dense that paper and
find an interesting result there. Um,

449
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,040
go ahead and post on Piazza or if any
of you want to solve their reading group

450
00:28:56,041 --> 00:29:00,270
of other friends here at Stanford, you
know, encourage you to look around class,

451
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:00,850
fine,
fine.

452
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:05,690
Finally group here on campus or
among your CSU 30 classmates,

453
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:06,310
what were,

454
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:11,310
we were all of your work colleagues for
those of you taking this on their CPD so

455
00:29:11,461 --> 00:29:12,700
that you can all keep,
you know,

456
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:16,350
studying to so that you're sharing and
learning and helping each other along.

457
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:20,700
Okay. Um, so that's it
for reading papers. Uh,

458
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:23,880
the second thing want to do today is
just give some longer term advice on

459
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:27,030
navigating a career in, in,
in machine learning. Right.

460
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,500
Any questions about this before I move on?

461
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,240
Okay, cool. All right.

462
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,090
But I hope that was useful.

463
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,860
Some of this I wish I had no when I was
a first year phd student, but we'll see.

464
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,230
All right. Um, let's see.

465
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:47,710
Can we turn on the lights
please? All right. All right.

466
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:50,410
So kind of in response to

467
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:57,490
requests from earlier citizen
earlier versions of the
clause before we, you know,

468
00:29:57,491 --> 00:30:00,700
as we approach the end of the quarter one,
so it gives some advice,

469
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:03,940
the housing navigator career
machine learning, right? So, uh,

470
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:04,870
today machine learning,

471
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,340
there are so many opportunities to do so
many exciting things. So, um, how do you,

472
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,010
you know, what, what, what
do you want to do? Um,

473
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,120
so I'm going to assume that,
um,

474
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,220
most of you will want to do one of
two things, right? At some point,

475
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,440
you know, you want to,
um, get the job right.

476
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,470
Maybe a job that does
work in machine learning,

477
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,320
including a faculty position for those
of you who I've been a professor.

478
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:35,680
But I guess eventually most people
end up with a job I think. Right?

479
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,900
I guess there are other alternatives but,
oh,

480
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,430
but then some of you want to go on to
more advanced graduate studies and it,

481
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,570
although even after you
get your phd at some point,

482
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:48,340
most people do get the job after
the Phd. Um, and, and, and by job,

483
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:53,110
I mean, uh, either in the
big company, you know,

484
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:56,290
or as, or a startup, right?

485
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,800
But regardless of the details of this,
I think,

486
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:02,130
I hope most of you wants
to do important work.

487
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,213
Cool.

488
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,160
Great. So, um,

489
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,690
what I like to do today is break,

490
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,080
you know this into how's he find a
job or join a phd program or whatever.

491
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:22,900
I then lets you do important work and I
want to break this discussion into two

492
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:26,620
steps. One is just, you know,
how, how do you get that position,

493
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:32,500
right?
How do you get that job off pharaoh?

494
00:31:32,501 --> 00:31:35,810
How do you get that offer of
admissions in a PhD program? Oh,

495
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,670
meshes in the master's program or
whatever you want to do. Um, and then two,

496
00:31:39,671 --> 00:31:40,960
is that selecting a position?

497
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,310
Okay,

498
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,390
right. Have a teen, you know,

499
00:31:46,391 --> 00:31:49,810
going to this university
of has that university or
which in taking on the job in

500
00:31:49,811 --> 00:31:51,070
this company for that company,

501
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,130
what are the ones that will tend to set
you up for success for long term crystal

502
00:31:55,131 --> 00:31:58,600
success and career success? Uh, and,
and really I hope that by the way,

503
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:02,620
I hope that all of these, I just tactics
to let you do important work, right?

504
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,280
I know these, I hope that's
what you want to do. Um,

505
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,010
so you know what the recruiters look for.

506
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,520
Oh. And I think just to
keep the language simpler,

507
00:32:15,521 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm going to pretend that I'm just
going to talk about finding a job.

508
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:22,390
But a lot of the very similar
things apply for PHD programs.

509
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,300
It's just instead of saying recruiters,
I would say admissions committees, right?

510
00:32:25,301 --> 00:32:27,130
Then it's actually,
some of this is,

511
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,680
this is they've just
focused on the job scenario.

512
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,870
So most recruiters love
for technical skills. Uh,

513
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,800
so for example, um, there are a
lot of, um, uh, machine learning.

514
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,720
They'll ask you questions
like, you know, well,

515
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:44,840
would you use grid into sands or
bachelor and sand? The, the consequences,

516
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,780
our bachelor's and what happens in the
batch size is too large or too small,

517
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,270
right?
So there are companies,

518
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,020
many companies today asking questions
like that in the interview process. Uh,

519
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,010
Oh, can you explain? There was an LCM
and the Gru and where would you use on?

520
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,220
So you really get questions like
that in many job interviews today.

521
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,980
And so recruits is looking for ml skills,
uh,

522
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,370
as well as,

523
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,990
and so you often be quizzed on
ml skills as well as our, um,

524
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,120
your coding ability. Right?
Um, and then beyond your,

525
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,570
and, and I think Silicon Valley has
become quite good at giving people the

526
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:23,270
assessments to test for real
skill in machine learning,

527
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,180
engineering and software engineering.
Um,

528
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,750
and then the other thing
they're recruiters will look
for that many recruiters

529
00:33:29,751 --> 00:33:31,580
will look for is a meaningful work.

530
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:43,670
And in particular, um,
uh, you know, they're all,

531
00:33:43,671 --> 00:33:48,330
some candidates that apply for
jobs that have very, um, uh,

532
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,840
theoreticals.
They're very academic skills.

533
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:54,370
Meaning you can answer all
the quiz questions about,
you know, what is bash norm,

534
00:33:54,371 --> 00:33:55,700
can you,
they're arguing December this,

535
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,630
but unless you've actually show him
that you can apply this and meaningful

536
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:04,310
setting, it's harder to convince a
company or recruiter that, you know,

537
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:08,060
not just a theory but they, you know, how
to actually make this stuff work. And so,

538
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:12,950
um, having done meaningful work using
machine learning is a very strong,

539
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,480
it's a very desirable candidate,

540
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,240
I think to a lot of companies
kind of work experience.

541
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:21,680
And I think really whether you've done,
whether you've done something meaningful,

542
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:26,750
um, reassures that you know, that
you can actually do work right.

543
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,460
It's not just economic quiz questions,

544
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:32,410
but you know how to implement during
the algorithms that work. Um, and, and,

545
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:35,570
and maybe, um, uh, yeah.

546
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:41,030
Um, and in many recruiters actually look
for your ability to keep on learning new

547
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:43,790
skills and stay on top of machine learning
and even see you've asked as well.

548
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,760
And so a very common pattern
for the, um, successful,

549
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:51,740
you know,

550
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:56,480
AI engineers say machine
learning engineers would be
the following where on the

551
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:59,750
horizontal axis I applied
to different areas.

552
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:04,040
So you might learn about machine learning,
learn about deep learning,

553
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,270
learn about probabilistic
graphical models, learn about NLP,

554
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:13,070
learn about computer vision and so on for
other areas of Ai and machine learning.

555
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,480
Um, and if the vertical
area, if the vertical axis is

556
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:21,810
death,
a lot of the strongest candidate,

557
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:24,290
so jobs are t shaped individuals,

558
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:27,770
meaning that you have a
broad understanding of many
different topics in the AI

559
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:32,030
and machine learning and very
deep understanding in, you know,

560
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,360
maybe at least one area, maybe
more than one the area. Um,

561
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,580
and so I think by taking assist two
30 and doing the things you're doing,

562
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:39,891
if you're a,

563
00:35:39,891 --> 00:35:43,590
hopefully you're acquiring
a deeper understanding of
one of these areas of deep

564
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:48,450
learning in particular. Um, but the
other thing that, uh, even, you know,

565
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,500
uh, deepens their knowledge in one
area will be the projects you work on,

566
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:58,180
the open source contributions
you make, right? Uh,

567
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:01,340
whether or not you've done search,
um,

568
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,600
and maybe whether or not
you've done an internship.

569
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,400
And I think these two elements,
you know,

570
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:13,150
broad area of skills and then also going
deeper to do a meaningful project and

571
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:17,340
deep learning or work of a
Stanford professor, right? Oh,

572
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,050
and do a meaningful
research project or a mix,

573
00:36:20,051 --> 00:36:23,250
some contributions to open
source publishing like Github
and there, let's use it.

574
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:27,300
These are the things that you deepen your
knowledge and convince recruiters that

575
00:36:27,301 --> 00:36:30,480
you both have the broad technical
schools and when called on,

576
00:36:30,481 --> 00:36:33,030
you're able to apply these in a,
in a,

577
00:36:33,031 --> 00:36:37,090
in a meaningful way to an important
problem, right? And in fact, um,

578
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,790
the way we design cs two 30 is
actually a microcosm of this where,

579
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:46,380
um, you know, you learned about
neuro nets, um, learn about topics.

580
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:50,580
They're bashed norm confidence,
a sequence models, right?

581
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:51,860
And just say rns.

582
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:58,390
So actually have a breath within
the field of deep learning.

583
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,950
And then what happens is no then,

584
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:05,220
and the reason why is you to work on the
project is so that you can pick one of

585
00:37:05,221 --> 00:37:10,221
these areas and maybe go deep and build
a meaningful project and one of these

586
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:15,510
areas, uh, which will, which war. And it's
not just about making a resume look good,

587
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:15,741
right?

588
00:37:15,741 --> 00:37:18,780
This is about giving you the practical
experience to make sure you actually know

589
00:37:18,781 --> 00:37:21,390
how to make these things work, um, uh,

590
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,630
and give you the learnings to make sure
that you actually know how the make of

591
00:37:24,631 --> 00:37:26,690
CNN work. You look at
our and then work. Uh,

592
00:37:26,691 --> 00:37:29,940
and then coincidentally the many students
also this depression and the resume's

593
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:34,120
obviously. Um, so I think the, um,

594
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,900
let's see, the, the, the
failure modes, the things,

595
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:47,820
bad ways to navigate your career. Um,
there are some students that just do this,

596
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,900
right? There are some Stanford students
that just take class off the cost off the

597
00:37:51,901 --> 00:37:52,860
costs,
off the clos,

598
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,480
and go equally in depth
in a huge range of areas.

599
00:37:57,481 --> 00:38:01,350
And this is not terrible. You can actually
still get a job. Uh, uh, you know, so get,

600
00:38:01,351 --> 00:38:05,010
sometimes you can even get into some
phd programs like this without the Def,

601
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:08,310
but this is not the best way
to navigate your career, right?

602
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,580
So there are some stem physicians who's,
that takes tons of classes.

603
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,040
You didn't get a good GPA doing that,
but do nothing else.

604
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:16,920
And this is not terrible,
but this is, this is not,

605
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:21,660
this is not great as it's not
as good as the alternative. Um,

606
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,060
there's one other thing I've seen
Stanford students do, which is, uh,

607
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,840
just try to do that,
right?

608
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:31,770
Which is just try to jump
in on day one and go really,

609
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:34,460
really deep in one area. And again, um,

610
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,130
this has its own challenges, I
guess. You know, one, one, one,

611
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:43,060
one failure mode. One mode is actually not
great. It's sometimes where she get, um,

612
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:43,650
uh,

613
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,460
undergrad freshmen at Stanford that have
not yet learned a lot about coding or

614
00:38:48,461 --> 00:38:51,730
software and dream or machine learning
and tried to jump into research project

615
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:52,121
right away.

616
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,090
And this turns out not to
be very efficient because it
turns out Stanford Causes,

617
00:38:55,091 --> 00:38:57,380
uh, you know, online
causes a Stanford closet.

618
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:00,880
There a very efficient way for you to
learn about the broad range of areas and

619
00:39:00,881 --> 00:39:04,860
after that great deeper getting experience
in one vertical area then deepens

620
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:07,300
your knowledge and makes sure, you know,
how they actually meet those ideas work.

621
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,330
Uh, so I do see sometimes,
unfortunately, you know,

622
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,660
sent some Stanford freshman join us
already knowing how the code and have

623
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,300
implemented, you know,
some learning our rooms,

624
00:39:16,301 --> 00:39:21,060
but some students that do not yet have
much experience tried to jump into

625
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,330
research project right away.

626
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,810
And that turns out not to
be very productive for the
student or for the research

627
00:39:25,811 --> 00:39:28,410
group because until you've
taken the courses and mass,

628
00:39:28,411 --> 00:39:31,310
the basics is difficult to understand
what's really going on at the advance

629
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:34,570
projects. Right. Um, so I would,

630
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:39,340
I would say this is actually worse than
that. Right. This is this is that, okay.

631
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:44,230
This is actually pretty bad. This is, I,
I will not do this for your career, right?

632
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,440
No, probably not. Yeah. Um,

633
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:52,890
and then the other not so great mode that
you see some San business do is get a

634
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:58,630
lot of breath and then do a tiny project
here and do a tiny project there.

635
00:39:58,631 --> 00:39:59,730
I do a tiny project there,

636
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:05,030
do a tiny project there and you end up
with 10 tiny projects but no one or two

637
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:09,280
really significant project.
Cause then again this is not terrible,

638
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,450
but you know,

639
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:15,990
beyond a certain point by the way
recruiters and not impressed by volume.

640
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,140
Right? So having done 10 lane
projects is actually not impressive,

641
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,670
not nearly as impressive as doing one
great project or two great projects.

642
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,610
And again, there's more to life
than impressing recruiters,

643
00:40:27,611 --> 00:40:28,990
but recruits is very rational.

644
00:40:28,991 --> 00:40:32,470
And the reason recruiters
are less impressed by someone
whose profile looks like

645
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:32,681
this,

646
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:37,060
it is because they're actually probably
factually less skilled and less able at

647
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:39,640
doing good work in machine
learning compared to someone that,

648
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,630
that has done their substantive
project and knows what it takes to see,

649
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:46,840
see the whole thing through. Does that
make sense? So when I say, you know,

650
00:40:46,841 --> 00:40:49,870
recruiters more or less impressive
because they're actually quite rational in

651
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:54,530
terms of trying to understand
how good you are at, um, uh,

652
00:40:54,810 --> 00:40:58,750
at, at, at doing important
work and building meaningful
AI systems. Can you sense,

653
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:00,400
um,

654
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,120
and so in terms of building up all the
horizontal piece and the vertical piece,

655
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:08,910
uh, this is what I recommend
to build the horizontal piece.

656
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,980
Love of this is about
building foundational skills.

657
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:20,930
And, um, it turns out coursework as
a very efficient way to do this. Uh,

658
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,240
you know, in, in, in these causes,
right? You know, various instructors,

659
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,910
Lakers where many of the
separate professors for the law,

660
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,710
the work and to organizing the content
and because efficient for you to learn

661
00:41:32,711 --> 00:41:35,950
this material. Um, and then also reading

662
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:42,610
research papers, which we
just talked about having a
community will help you. Um,

663
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,660
and then that is often
a building a more deep

664
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,753
okay.

665
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,440
And relevant project [inaudible]
precious how to rather than,

666
00:41:59,441 --> 00:42:02,090
so you know, if you want to build
a career at machine learning,

667
00:42:02,091 --> 00:42:02,960
could be liquor in the eye.

668
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,730
Hopefully the project is something that's
relevant to cs or machine learning or

669
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:10,050
AI or deep learning. Um,
I do see, I don't know,

670
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:14,610
for some reason I feel like a surprisingly
large number of stamps ins I know are

671
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,190
the Stanford Don's true. And they spent
a lot of time on that, which is fine.

672
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,840
If you enjoy dancing, go have fun, don't
you? You don't need to work all the time.

673
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:23,590
So going,

674
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:28,060
joined a dance to or go on the overseas
exchange program and go hang out in

675
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:32,860
London and have fun. But those things
do not as directly contribute to this.

676
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,800
Right. Yeah, I know.

677
00:42:37,801 --> 00:42:40,410
I think, I think in the earlier
version of this presentation, yeah.

678
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,970
Stairs walked away saying, Huh, you
know, Andrea says we should not have fun.

679
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:46,820
It should work all the time
and that's not the girl.

680
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,493
Um,

681
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,970
all right,
there is one.

682
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:11,940
All right.

683
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,840
Okay.

684
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,130
You know,
there is the,

685
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,550
okay,

686
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:24,070
Saturday morning problem,
which all of you will face,

687
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,210
which is every week,
uh,

688
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:33,280
including this week on Saturday morning
you'll have a choice. Um, you can,

689
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:34,840
uh,
read the paper.

690
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,583
Okay.

691
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:49,550
What kind of research or working on open
source or I don't know why people do or

692
00:43:51,631 --> 00:43:52,860
you could watch TV or something

693
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,890
and you were facing a choice
maybe every Saturday, you know,

694
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,790
for the rest of your life or for loss,
Adam days and the rest of your life. And,

695
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,360
um, you know, you can build
out that foundation skills,

696
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,580
go deep or go have fun and you should
have fun. All right, let's go the record.

697
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,980
But one of the problems that a lot of
people face is that even if you spend all

698
00:44:16,771 --> 00:44:21,120
Saturday and all Sunday reading
a research paper, um, you know,

699
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:25,080
the following Monday or maybe spend
all Saturday and Sunday working hard,

700
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,280
it turns out that the following Monday
you're not that much better at deep

701
00:44:29,281 --> 00:44:34,190
learning is like, yeah, you
work really. So you read five
papers, you know, great. Uh,

702
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:37,670
but if your work have a research
group, the professor or your, you know,

703
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,010
or your manager, if you're in the company,
they have no idea how hard you work.

704
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:44,510
So there's no one to come by and say,
Oh, good job working so hard all weekend.

705
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:49,570
So no one knows the sacrifices you may
all weekend to study or code open soles

706
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,180
in Poland is this,
no one knows.

707
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:55,020
So there's almost no short term
reward to doing these things. Um,

708
00:44:55,470 --> 00:45:00,470
but the C and whereas they might be
short term rewards to doing other things.

709
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,300
Right. Um, uh,

710
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,590
but the secret to this is that it's
not about reading papers really,

711
00:45:07,591 --> 00:45:12,090
really hot for one Saturday morning or
for all Saturday once and then being done.

712
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:16,770
The secret to this is to do this
consistently, um, you know, for years,

713
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:18,080
um,
or at least a month's.

714
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:23,090
And it turns out that if you read two
papers a week and you do that for a year,

715
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:27,660
then you will have read 50 papers after
a year and you will be much better at

716
00:45:27,661 --> 00:45:30,060
teaching learning off of
that. Right? Uh, I mean,

717
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:34,480
when you read your read 100 papers in
the year of UV two papers a week and,

718
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,150
uh,
and so as,

719
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,920
so for you to be successful as much less
about the intense burst of effort you

720
00:45:40,921 --> 00:45:42,240
put in over one weekend,

721
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,620
it's much more about whether you can
find a little bit of time every week to

722
00:45:46,621 --> 00:45:48,490
read a few papers or crunch.

723
00:45:48,491 --> 00:45:52,770
We have a bit of open source
or take someone I causes
AV, but, and if you do that,

724
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:56,340
you know, every week for six months,
so do that every week for a year,

725
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:00,210
you've will actually learned a lot about
these views and be much better and be

726
00:46:00,211 --> 00:46:04,450
much more capable at deep learning or
machine learning or whatever. Right. Um,

727
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,820
yeah. So, um, yeah, and, but yeah,

728
00:46:09,821 --> 00:46:10,860
it actually has essentially my,
my,

729
00:46:10,890 --> 00:46:15,360
my wife and I actually do not own a
TV for what a soar. But again, if you,

730
00:46:15,361 --> 00:46:19,740
if if you, oh my, go ahead. It's fine.
Make sure it don't, don't, don't,

731
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,490
don't drive yourself crazy. And the
healthy work life integration as well.

732
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:31,380
All right. So, um,

733
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,680
so I hope that doing these things well,

734
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,610
it's not about finding a job is about
doing these things to make you more

735
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:42,840
capable as a machine learning person
so that you have the power to garden,

736
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:47,310
implement stuff that matters to stuff
that you do, do work that matters.

737
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,210
Well, the second thing which
had about, is selecting a job

738
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,210
and it's actually really
interesting. Um, I, uh,

739
00:46:56,130 --> 00:47:00,780
gave this part of the presentation,
um, last year, uh, actually, sorry,

740
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:04,590
earlier this year and shortly
after that presentation, um,

741
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,150
there was a student in the class,

742
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:09,810
there was already in a company who
emailed me saying, boy, Andrew,

743
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:13,080
I wish you had told me this before.
I said to my current job. Um,

744
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:18,090
so let's see. Let's see, let's see.
Hopefully this will be useful to you.

745
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,930
Um, so it turns out that, um,

746
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:27,900
uh, you know, so at some point
you're at, you're deciding, you know,

747
00:47:27,901 --> 00:47:29,470
what phd problem do you wanna apply for?

748
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:32,660
What companies do want as
high for a job ads? And, um,

749
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,260
I can tell you what, uh, well,

750
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,980
so if you want to keep
learning new things, um,

751
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,060
I think one of the biggest predictors
of your success will be whether or not

752
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,610
you're working with great people

753
00:47:51,310 --> 00:47:54,980
and projects.
Right?

754
00:47:55,690 --> 00:48:00,430
And in particular, um, you
know, there, there are these
fascinating results from, uh,

755
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:04,680
uh, I think, I want to say from the
social sciences showing that, um,

756
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,010
if your closest friends,

757
00:48:06,011 --> 00:48:09,640
if your five closest friends who are
10 closest friends are all smokers,

758
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:12,100
there isn't much high shine as you
become a smoker as well. Right?

759
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,300
And if you're five or 10 close
friends are, um, uh, uh, you know,

760
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:20,300
overweight as much high chance you would
do the same. Or conversely it does, uh,

761
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,120
um, you know, so I think that if your
five closest friends work really hard,

762
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,280
really long research papers,
care about their work, uh,

763
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,950
learning and making themselves better,

764
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:31,930
then that's actually a very
good chance that you will be,

765
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,320
that they'll influence you that
way as well. So we're all human.

766
00:48:35,321 --> 00:48:39,820
We all influenced by the people
around us, right? And so, um,

767
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:42,490
I think that,
and I've been fortunate,

768
00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:44,130
I've taught at Stanford
for a long time now. It's,

769
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,140
I've been fortunate to have seen a lot
of students go from Stanford to various

770
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:53,290
careers and because I've seen how many
hundreds or maybe low thousands of

771
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:56,920
Stanford students that I knew right
when there was still statuses go on to

772
00:48:56,921 --> 00:49:01,330
separate job, I sold many of them have
amazing careers. Um, I saw, you know,

773
00:49:01,331 --> 00:49:04,640
a few have like, like, okay careers. Um,

774
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:09,490
but I think over time I've learned to
pattern match what is predictive of your

775
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,140
future success after the staff.
And then we share with you somethings,

776
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,720
pat share with you some of those patterns
as you navigate your career. And, and,

777
00:49:15,721 --> 00:49:18,100
and it's just, there's so many
options in machine learning today.

778
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:20,350
It's kind of tragic if you don't,
you know,

779
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:24,100
navigate to to hopefully maximize the
chance of being one of the people that

780
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:28,150
gets to do fun and important work
that helps, helps others. Um,

781
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,350
so when selecting a position,
um,

782
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:35,020
I would advice you to focus

783
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:39,040
on the team.
Um,

784
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,990
you interact with and by team I mean,
you know,

785
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:50,850
somewhere between 10 to 30 persons rent,

786
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,670
maybe up to 50. Um, because
it turns out that if, if,

787
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:59,770
if you, um, there will be some group
of people, maybe 10 to 30 people,

788
00:49:59,771 --> 00:50:02,890
maybe 50 people that you
interact with quite closely,

789
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:07,360
and these will be your peers and the
people that influence you the most,

790
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:11,170
right? Um, because if you join
a company with 10,000 people,

791
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:13,660
you will not interact
with all 10,000 people.

792
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:17,890
There will be a core of 10 or 30 or 50
people that you interact with the most.

793
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,310
And is those people how much they know,
how much she didn't teach you,

794
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,300
how hardworking they are,

795
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:26,200
whether they are learning themselves that
will influence you the most rotted and

796
00:50:26,201 --> 00:50:30,530
all these other hypothetical 10,000
people in the giant company. Um,

797
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:34,820
and of these people, one of the ones
that will influence you the most is uh,

798
00:50:34,821 --> 00:50:36,500
your manager,
right?

799
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:39,290
So make sure you meet your manager and
get to know them and make sure there's

800
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:42,290
someone you want to work
with. Um, and in particular,

801
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:47,420
I would recommend focusing on
these things and not on the brand

802
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:57,370
of the company because it turns out that
the brand of the company you work with

803
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,670
is actually not that correlates it. Yeah,
maybe there's a very weak correlation,

804
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,680
but there's actually not that correlated
with what your personal experience will

805
00:51:04,681 --> 00:51:09,110
be like. Oh, it makes
sense. Right? Um, and so,

806
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:10,243
um,

807
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:19,060
and, and by the way, again, just, you
know, full disclosure on one wheel,

808
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:21,860
I have a research group here at
Stanford, right? My recent career,

809
00:51:21,861 --> 00:51:24,830
Stanford is one of the better
known researchers in the world.

810
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:28,040
But just don't join us because you think
we're well known, right? It's this,

811
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,710
it's just not a good reason to
join some of the brands. Instead,

812
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,970
you're only work with someone,

813
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:35,870
meet the people and evaluate
the individuals or look
at the people and see if

814
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,740
you think these are people you can
learn from a worker and a good people.

815
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:42,723
Okay.

816
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,330
So,
um,

817
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,800
so in today's world, there
are a lot of companies, um,

818
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:05,880
recruiting Stanford students.
So let me give you some advice.

819
00:52:05,881 --> 00:52:10,260
In this piece of volume are good because
many as well, I just give the advice.

820
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:15,350
So sometimes there are giant
companies with let's say, um,

821
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,850
uh, uh, you know, 50,000 people, right?

822
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,830
And I'm not thinking of any one specific
company if you're trying to get so

823
00:52:20,831 --> 00:52:23,340
confidence in golf, there's no one
specific company I'm thinking of,

824
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:26,580
but this pattern matches,
uh, to many large companies,

825
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:30,670
but maybe there's a giant company
with 50,000 people, right?

826
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:38,520
And that say that they have a 300 person,

827
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,360
right? Ai Team. Um,

828
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,820
it turns out that if you look at the
work of the few and depressing the I team

829
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:52,410
and if they send you a job offer
to join to 300% of the it team,

830
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:55,920
that might be pretty good, right? This
is, this may be a group, you know,

831
00:52:55,921 --> 00:52:59,370
whose work you hear about their potions
papers. You really want a news. Um,

832
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:03,180
and so if you can a job offer to work
with this group that might be pretty good

833
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:06,570
or even better,
would be sometimes even within the 30%,

834
00:53:06,571 --> 00:53:09,840
the Itm is actually difficult to
tell what's good and what's not.

835
00:53:09,870 --> 00:53:12,900
There's often a lot of errands,
even with this was even better,

836
00:53:12,901 --> 00:53:17,550
would be if you get a job offer
to join the 30 person team.

837
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:21,510
So you actually know who's your manager,
who your peers, who you're working with.

838
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:23,910
And if you think these are 30
great people you can learn from,

839
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:29,190
that could be a job offer on the
failure mode that unfortunately,

840
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:33,060
I've seen several Stanford students
go down there and say, actually,

841
00:53:33,061 --> 00:53:36,260
this is a true story. Uh, there was ones,
uh, several years ago as a San Franciscan,

842
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:39,540
I knew that, I thought it was a great
guy. Right? You know, I, I knew his work.

843
00:53:39,541 --> 00:53:41,070
He was Kodak machine
there in the outer rooms.

844
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,290
I thought he was very sharp
and did very good work. Uh,

845
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:45,750
working with some of my phd students.

846
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:51,260
He got a job offer from one of these
giant companies with that has a great AI

847
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:53,080
group.
Um,

848
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:58,190
and his Alpha wasn't to go to the AI group
is offer was to join us and there was

849
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:00,480
sign you to a team.
So this,

850
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:03,990
pick the student that was this emphasis
and I know about and the kind of care

851
00:54:03,991 --> 00:54:04,830
about,
um,

852
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,920
he wound up being assigned to really
boring a Java or backend payments team.

853
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,880
And, uh, so after you set the job offer,
he wound up being assigned to a, you know,

854
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,380
back in and apologize Emma, you work on
Java backend payment processing systems.

855
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,214
I think they're great.

856
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,320
But the student was assigned to that
team and he was really bored. And so,

857
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,010
um, I think that this was a
student whose career I perceive,

858
00:54:29,011 --> 00:54:33,780
so has career rising while he was at
Stanford and after he went to this,

859
00:54:34,090 --> 00:54:38,260
frankly not very interesting team,
I saw his career plateau. Um,

860
00:54:38,261 --> 00:54:39,500
and after about a year and a half,

861
00:54:39,501 --> 00:54:42,840
he resigned from this company after
wasting a year and a half of his life and

862
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:46,920
missing out really on a year and a half
of this very exciting growth of AI and

863
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:51,540
machine learning. Right? So it does.
Very unfortunate. Um, uh, and, and Oh,

864
00:54:51,590 --> 00:54:56,220
it was actually after I told this story
last time I taught this class earlier

865
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,270
this year that actually
someone from, um, uh,

866
00:54:59,450 --> 00:55:03,940
actually was actually from the same big
company you felt Mina said by Andrea.

867
00:55:03,950 --> 00:55:07,080
Wish she told me the story earlier because
this is exactly what happened to me

868
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,790
at the same big company.

869
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:16,420
Now I want to share with
you, uh, a different, um,

870
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,680
so, so I would just be careful about
rotation programs as well. You know,

871
00:55:23,010 --> 00:55:24,480
when a company is trying to recruit you,

872
00:55:24,481 --> 00:55:27,180
if a company refuses to tell
you what projects you work on,

873
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:30,570
who is your manager exactly what
team you're joining, I proceed.

874
00:55:30,571 --> 00:55:35,350
Do not find those job offers that
attractive because, uh, it, the con,

875
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,623
you know,

876
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:40,350
if they refuse to tell you what team
are going to work with while chances are

877
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:43,890
right, tell me the answer will not
make the job attractive to you.

878
00:55:43,891 --> 00:55:46,320
That's why they're not telling you.
So just be very careful.

879
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:51,120
And sometimes rotation programs sound
good on paper, but it's really, you know,

880
00:55:51,121 --> 00:55:52,870
well,
we'll figure out where to send you later.

881
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,920
So I feel like I've seen some students
go into rotation programs that sound good

882
00:55:58,081 --> 00:56:00,000
on paper.
That sounds like a good idea.

883
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,240
But just as you would in [inaudible]
Stanford would you want to do for

884
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:06,090
internships and then apply for a job,
there'll be a weird thing to do.

885
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,010
So sometimes rotation permits out,

886
00:56:08,011 --> 00:56:10,930
Yo come and do for internships and they
will let you apply for a job and see

887
00:56:10,931 --> 00:56:11,761
where we were when I sent you.

888
00:56:11,761 --> 00:56:16,260
And it could be Java backend payment
processing system, right? So, um, uh,

889
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:21,270
so just, just be cautious about the
marketing of rotation programs. Oh,

890
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,740
and again, if you do, but if, but if they,

891
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,920
what they say is do rotation
and then you joined this team,

892
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,860
then you can look at this team
and say, Yep, that's a great team.

893
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:30,910
I want to do a rotation.

894
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:34,880
But then I would go and work with this
team and these are the 30 people worker.

895
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,180
So that could be great.
But during rotation,

896
00:56:37,181 --> 00:56:39,970
then you could send you anywhere in this
giant company that I would just be very

897
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:44,140
careful if, all right.
Um, now on the flip side,

898
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,260
they're awesome companies and I'm
not going to mention any companies,

899
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,530
but there are some companies where
you though are not as glamorous. Now,

900
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,110
there's not as right cool brands.
Um,

901
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:56,990
and maybe this is a Oh
no 10,000 person company,

902
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,550
1000 or 50,000 per second or whatever,
unless it's 10,000 for a coffee.

903
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:05,970
I have seen many companies that are
not super well known in the AI world.

904
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,450
They're not in the news all the time,

905
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:12,810
but they may have a very elite team of
a hundred people doing great work in

906
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:17,830
machine learning. Right? And there are
definitely companies whose brands and not,

907
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,693
you know,

908
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,480
the first company you would think of
when you think of great AI companies, um,

909
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,590
that sometimes they have a really,
really great 10 person or 50 person,

910
00:57:26,591 --> 00:57:29,830
a 100 person team that works under,
in the algorithms.

911
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:34,180
And even if the overall brand,
the overall company, you know,

912
00:57:34,181 --> 00:57:36,610
isn't as like,
as a little bit sucky,

913
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:41,880
if you manage to track down this team
and if you have a job offer to join this

914
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,660
team in a much bigger company,

915
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:48,460
you could actually learn a lot from these
people and do important work. You know,

916
00:57:48,461 --> 00:57:50,320
one of the things about
silicon valley is that, um,

917
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,360
the brand on your resume
matters lesson less, right?
Less than ever before. I mean,

918
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:58,900
I guess, Oh, I think, uh, uh, the
exception of the Stanford brand,

919
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:01,690
you're totally when the staff of
grounded resume, but with that exception,

920
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:05,230
they're really, your silicon valley's
become really good. Sorry, the, the world,

921
00:58:05,290 --> 00:58:08,710
right? It has become really
good at evaluating people
for your genuine technical

922
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:12,280
schools and your genuine capability
and less for your brands. Um,

923
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:16,540
and so I would recommend that instead
of trying to get the best stamps of

924
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:20,080
approval on your resume to
go and tick the positions,

925
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:23,650
they let you have the best learning
experiences and also allows you to do the

926
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:27,480
most important work. And that has
really shaped by the, you know,

927
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:32,490
30 or 50 people you work with and not
by the overall brand of the company you

928
00:58:32,501 --> 00:58:35,770
work with. Right. So the
variants across, um, uh,

929
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:39,520
so there's a huge variance
across teams within one company,

930
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,220
and that variance is actually
pretty bigger or might be
bigger than the veterans

931
00:58:44,230 --> 00:58:46,920
across different companies does
make sense. So, so I would,

932
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,350
and if a company refuses to
tell you what team you rejoin,

933
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,040
I would seriously consider just, you know,
doing so if you have a better option,

934
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:58,370
I would do something else.
Um, and then finally,

935
00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:02,450
um, yeah, and, and so really, I, again, I,

936
00:59:02,451 --> 00:59:04,480
I guess I don't want to name
these companies, but you know,

937
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:08,920
think of some of the large retailers or
some of the large healthcare systems or

938
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:13,150
the lot of companies, uh, that are
not well known in the Ai World,

939
00:59:13,151 --> 00:59:15,520
but that I've met the AI teams.
I think they're great.

940
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:18,310
And so if you're able to find
those jobs and meet their people,

941
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:20,830
you can actually get very
exciting jobs in here, right? Oh,

942
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:24,590
but up cost for the giant companies
that Evie I teams you can join that Uva,

943
00:59:24,591 --> 00:59:27,060
the my aunt. That's also,
that's also a great,

944
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:30,340
I'm a bit biased since I used
to lead some of these team. So,

945
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:34,900
so I think those things are great, but
that's a, but also some teams in the, um,

946
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:40,500
uh, yeah. All right. Um,

947
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:45,500
lost sleep, you know, just general advice.
This is how I really live my life. Um,

948
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,300
I tend to choose the things to work on.
They'll allow you to

949
00:59:54,310 --> 00:59:58,970
learn the most. Um, you know,
we tried to do important work,

950
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:10,070
so, you know, especially if you're
a relative, the early in career,

951
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:14,690
whether have you learn the, your career
will pay off for a long time. And so,

952
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,010
um, uh, uh, and so joining the teams,

953
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:23,450
they're working with a great set of 10
or 30 or 50 teammates will let you learn

954
01:00:23,451 --> 01:00:28,390
a lot. Um, and then also,
you know, hopefully, I mean,
yeah. And, and, and uh, and,

955
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:32,780
and just don't, don't, don't join,
uh, like a sacred company and hope,

956
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,070
you know, give more people cancer or
stuff like that. Or is this, don't,

957
01:00:36,071 --> 01:00:39,740
don't do this, don't do stuff like that.
But if you can do meaningful worth,

958
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:42,520
it helps other people and
do important work, uh, uh,

959
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:47,410
and also learn a lot on the way. Hopefully
you can find positions site that, that,

960
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,710
that, that lets you set, set
yourself up for long term success.

961
01:00:50,711 --> 01:00:54,080
We'll also do work that you think
matters and that it helps other people.

962
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,120
All right. Um, any
questions before we wrap up?

963
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,130
What's important?
You know,

964
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:18,200
I think one of the most meaningful things
to do in life is help other people,

965
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:21,420
uh, either advance the human
condition or help other people.

966
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:23,100
But the thing is I'm nervous.

967
01:01:23,130 --> 01:01:26,460
I don't want to name one or two things
because the world needs a lot of people

968
01:01:26,461 --> 01:01:27,720
who work in a lot of different things.

969
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:32,250
So the world's not going to function if
everyone works on computational biology.

970
01:01:32,251 --> 01:01:33,400
I think con bio is great,

971
01:01:33,401 --> 01:01:38,280
but it's actually good that where people
work on come bio. My Phd students like,

972
01:01:38,310 --> 01:01:41,630
you know, uh, many work on
the outside to healthcare. Uh,

973
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:45,150
my team at landing AI does a lot of
work on the outside to manufacturing to

974
01:01:45,151 --> 01:01:49,500
every culture, to some health care
and some other industries. Um, uh,

975
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:53,280
I actually, especially the
California fires burning, you know,

976
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:56,760
I actually think that there's important
work to be done in AI and climate change.

977
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:59,050
Uh, um, but I think that, uh,

978
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,670
there's a log of them important
work and a lot of industries, right?

979
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:04,810
So I should think that,
you know,

980
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:07,860
I actually think that the
next wave of Ai sees me,

981
01:02:07,861 --> 01:02:11,400
I should say machine learning
is with, we've already, um,

982
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:16,560
transform a lot of the tech
world. Right? Uh, uh, so,

983
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:17,910
you know, yeah. I mean,

984
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:22,770
we've already helped a lot of the second
valley tech world become cadet AI and

985
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:25,800
that's fate, right? Help build a cover
of the teams. They wound up doing this,

986
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:29,100
right? Google brain. How Google become
good. The deep learning, the, by the way,

987
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:33,060
I grew up hop, I do become, you
know, good at one of the greatest,

988
01:02:33,061 --> 01:02:37,830
the I companies in the world. So the in
China. Um, and I'm very happy that, uh,

989
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,930
between me and some of my
friends in the industry,

990
01:02:39,931 --> 01:02:41,880
we've made a lot of good AI companies.

991
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:46,860
I think part of the next phase for the
evolution of machine learning is Fred to

992
01:02:46,861 --> 01:02:51,840
go into not just the tech companies like,
you know, like the Google and Baidu,

993
01:02:51,841 --> 01:02:53,940
which I hoped as well as, you
know, Facebook, Microsoft,

994
01:02:53,941 --> 01:02:58,660
which had nothing to do with as well as,
um, what else? Airbnb, Pinterest, Rubella,

995
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:01,440
right? All these are great companies.
I hope they're all embrace AI,

996
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,330
but I think some of the most
exciting work to be done.

997
01:03:03,331 --> 01:03:07,140
So it was also look outside the tech
industry, uh, and to look at all the,

998
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:12,390
sometimes call them traditional industries
that do not have shiny tech things

999
01:03:12,391 --> 01:03:15,810
because I think the value
creation there as surprise,

1000
01:03:15,811 --> 01:03:20,260
you could implement there maybe even
bigger than if you, you know, uh,

1001
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,390
uh, uh, yeah. Uh, actually I, I
mentioned one interesting thing.

1002
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,580
One thing I notice is a lot
of the large tech companies,

1003
01:03:26,581 --> 01:03:30,090
I'll work on the same problems, right?
So everyone, we're a machine translation.

1004
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:33,840
Every Ross speech recognition,
face detection at click through rate.

1005
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,020
And part of me feels like this is
great because it means there's a lot of

1006
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,840
progress in machine translation
and that's great. We do,

1007
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:41,190
I'm proud of the machine translation.

1008
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,120
But sometimes when you look at
other industries, um, so you know,

1009
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:48,250
when the look at manufacturing or um,
uh,

1010
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,850
some of the medical devices,
things working at odds or uh,

1011
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:55,840
sometimes they'll on these farms
hanging out with farmers on, on, on, um,

1012
01:03:56,050 --> 01:04:00,780
few like in my own work and my teams
where sometimes we're stumbling across

1013
01:04:00,781 --> 01:04:04,800
brand new research problems that the big
tech companies do not see and have not

1014
01:04:04,801 --> 01:04:06,270
yet learned to frame.

1015
01:04:06,271 --> 01:04:09,510
So find one of the most intellectually
exciting challenges is actually you to be

1016
01:04:09,511 --> 01:04:12,690
constantly on the cutting age, uh,
looking at these types of problems.

1017
01:04:12,691 --> 01:04:15,240
There's a different cutting edge than
the containers, the big tech companies.

1018
01:04:15,241 --> 01:04:18,330
So I think some of you are joining the
big tech companies and that's great.

1019
01:04:18,331 --> 01:04:21,180
We need more AI and the big
companies in the tech companies.

1020
01:04:21,181 --> 01:04:24,990
But I think lot of exciting
work to do in AI is also, um,

1021
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:27,950
outside what we traditionally
consider the tech. Great.

1022
01:04:29,790 --> 01:04:33,360
All right. US tent this
whole fifties. So, hope,

1023
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:38,070
I hope this was helpful. Um, uh, and,
uh, let's, let's break, visit. Oh,

1024
01:04:38,150 --> 01:04:40,230
have a, have a great
thanksgiving, everyone,

1025
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:41,370
and we'll see you in a couple of weeks.
