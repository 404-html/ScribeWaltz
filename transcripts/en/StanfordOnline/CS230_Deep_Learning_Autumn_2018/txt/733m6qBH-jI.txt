Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Um, okay. Hey, everyone looks like we're on a, so as usual, if you have not yet, um, please enter your suid so that we know you're here in this room. Um, so I should compete for him. He, okay. The back is it okay? Oh yes. Is the volume okay? Are the back all right? No one's responding. Yes. Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay, so, um, what are the ones to do today is share a you two things. You know, we're approaching the end of the course. There are a hope you guys looking forward to the Thanksgiving break. Um, next week, um, Ashley and I guess we were La home viewers, but those of us does do that. Viewing this from outside California. I know that we're all feeling really bad air here in California. I said, Whoa, there's some of you are watching this at home yet.

Speaker 1:          00:00:54       That's a air wherever you are. Um, uh, but um, well to do today is give you some advice that will set you up for the future of stuff. Even beyond the conclusion of cs two 30 and in particular one on one to do today is share with view some advice on how to read research papers. Uh, because you know, deep down is evolving fast enough that even though you've learned law, the foundations of deep learning, I learned a lot of the tips and tricks then you probably know better than many practitioners. How's it as you can do going out rooms to work already. Um, when you're working on specific applications where doing comms division on national falsing let's be recognition or something else, um, for you to be able to efficiently figure out the academic literature on key parts of the deep learning world will help you keep on developing and you know, staying on top of ideas even as they evolve over the next several years or maybe decades.

Speaker 1:          00:01:51       So firstly we want to do is, um, give you advice on how, uh, when say when I'm trying to master a new body of literature, how I go about that and hope that those techniques will be useful to help you be more efficient. How you read research papers. Um, and then the second thing is in previous offerings of this cost, one request from a lot of students was just advice for navigating a career in machine learning. And so in the second half of today, I want to share some thoughts with you on that. Okay. Um, so it turns out that, so I guess too is how pigs meeting besides papers, right? And, um, and then second career advice in machine learning. So turns out that, um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:39       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       You know, reading besides papers, this one of those things that a lot of phd students learn via Osmosis, right? Meaning that if you're a phd student and you see, you know, a few professors will see other phd students do sorts of the things that he might try to pick it up by Osmosis. But I hope today to a celebrate your efficiency and how you acquiring all this yourself from DOL, from the academic literature. Right? And so, um, then I say that this an area you want to become good at. Let's say you want to build that speech recognition. Alright, just turns it off for now. Let's see. You want to build that to him? Speech recognition system that we talked about it cause they're Robert's, her and all. And then the desk lamp, right? Um, this is what I read. There's a sequence of steps I recommend you take on, which is first Kampala, this papers. Um, and uh, and, and by papers I mean both research papers often posted on archive, on the Internet, but also plus medium pose. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:03:44       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       Yeah, Wah. Maybe some okays get helped poses though those are rare raw. Uh, but whatever texts or learning resources you have. And then, um, what I usually do is end up skipping around in this, right? So if I'm trying to master a new body of knowledge, so you want learn about speech recognition systems, this is what it feels like to read a set of papers, which is maybe you initially start off with five papers. And if on the horizontal axis I plot, you know, 0% to 100% red slash. Understood, right? Um, the way it feels like reading these papers is often I'll read, you know, 10% of each paper or I try to quickly skim and understanding each of these papers. And if based on that you decide that paper number two is a dud, right? Other, other, other authors, even Satan and say, boy, they sure they show it wrong, will you be there?

Speaker 1:          00:04:44       It just doesn't make sense. Then go ahead and forget it. And as you skip around to different papers, uh, you might decide that paper three is they're really seminar one and then spend a lot of time to go ahead and read and understand the whole thing. And based on that, you might then find a six paper from the citations and read that and go back and flesh or your understanding of paper for, and then find the paper seven and go and read that all the way to the conclusion. Um, but this is what it feels like as you, you know, assemble and lists of papers and skipping around and they try to, um, uh, uh, monster, a body of literature right around some topic that you want to learn. And I think, um, some rough guidelines, you know, if Your View 50th to 20 papers, I think you have a basic understanding of a, of an area, right?

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       So let me, I was like maybe good enough to do some work, apply some algorithms. Um, if you read 50 to a hundred papers in an area like speech recognition and, and kind of understanding a lot of it, then that's part of the enough to give you a very good understanding of an area. Right? You, you might, I don't know, I'm, I, I'm as careful about when I say like you mastering a subject, but you're beat 50 a hundred papers on speech recognition. You had a very good understanding, uh, speech recognition. Oh, if you're interested in say, domain at that station, right? By the time you've read 50 or a hundred papers, do you have a very good understanding of, of a subject like that? But they read five to 20 papers. It's probably enough for you to implement it, but maybe not, not sure if there's enough for you to do research or be really at the cutting edge. But these are maybe some guidelines for the volume of reading you should aspire to if you want to pick up a new area. But I'll take one association and cs two 30 and go more deeply into it. Right. Um, no.

Speaker 1:          00:06:31       How do you read one paper? And, um, I hope most of you brought your laptop. So what I'm going to do is describe to you how I read one paper and then after that I'm actually going to ask all of you to, you know, download the paper online. They just take, I'll know, uh, uh, take, take a few minutes of, read a paper right here in class and see how far you can get understanding of research paper in just minutes. Right, right here in class. Okay. Um, so when reading one paper, so the bad way to read the paper is to go from the first word until the last word, right. This is a bad way to when you want, you have a paper like this. Oh, and by the way, Ashley here and tell you what my real life is like. So, um, I actually pretty much everywhere I go, whenever I backpack, this is my actual fo there.

Speaker 1:          00:07:19       Um, I don't want to show, this is my actual folder of unread paper. So pretty much everywhere I go, I actually have a paper, a stack of papers is on my personal reading lists. This is actually my real life. I didn't bring this to show you. This isn't like that pat all the time. Uh, and I think that, I don't know, these days I'm on my team at landing Ain t blinder AI. I personally lead in reading group where I lead a discussion about two papers a week. Uh, but to select two papers and means I need to eat like five or six papers a week to select to, you know, to present or discuss at the [inaudible] meeting group. So this is my real life. Right? And how I tried to stay on top of the pitcher show and I have a, I'm doing a lot if I can find this fine, if I can find the time to beat, you know, a couple of papers will be hopefully all of you can to, um, uh, but when I'm reading a paper, this is, this is how I would recommend you go about it, which is don't go from the first or, and they read until the last word.

Speaker 1:          00:08:13       Um, instead up tick multiple passes through the paper.

Speaker 1:          00:08:21       Right. Um, and so, you know, step one is a we the title, the abstract and also the figures. Um, especially in the deep learning, there are a lot of research papers where stuff, the entire paper is summarize it, one or two fingers and they figure captions. So, um, so sometimes just by reading the title abstract and you know, the key neural network architecture figure that just describes what the whole papers out and maybe one or two of the experiments section, you can sometimes get a very good sense of what the whole paper is about without hardly reading any of the texts in their pay for itself. Right? That's the first pass. Second Pass. I would tend to read more carefully the intro to conclusions. Um, look carefully at all the fingers again and then skim the rest. And you know, um, I don't know how many of you are publish academic papers, but, uh, when people publish academic papers, um, part of, you know, the publication process is convincing the reviewers that your paper is worthy for a sentence.

Speaker 1:          00:09:43       And so what you find is that the abstract ensuring conclusion is often when the authors tried to summarize their work really, really carefully to make a case to make a really clear case to the review as to why they think their paper should be accepted for publication. And so because of that, you know, maybe slightly not slightly unusual incentive, the intro and conclusion and abstract often give a very clear summary of what's the paper actually about. Um, and depending on, um, and again, just be bluntly honest with you guys. Um, the related work section is useful if you want. It's sometimes useful. You want to do understand related work and figure out what's, what are the most important works in the papers. But the first time you read this you might skim or even skip skim the related work section. And it turns out, unless you're already from early literature, if this is a body of net worth that you're not that familiar with the related work section is sometimes almost impossible to understand. Uh, and again, since I'm being very honest with you guys, sometimes the related work section is when the authors tried to say everyone that could possibly be reviewing the paper and to make them a few good and then hopefully accepted paper if it's a related work sections and sometimes written in funny ways, right? Um, and then, uh, set three. I would often read the paper, but I'm just skip the math.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       Right. Um, and for wheat, the whole thing, but skip pass, it don't make sense, you know? Um, I think that uh, one thing that's happened many times in their research is that, I mean the papers, we tend to be cutting edge research. And so when we publish things, we sometimes don't know what's really important. It was not important. Right? So there, there are many examples of well known, highly cited research papers, whereas some of it was just great stuff. And some of it, you know, turned out to be unimportant. But at the time to paypal has written, the authors did not know every no one on the planet knew what was important and what was not important. And maybe one example, um, the, the net five paper, right sound, no paper by Yonder Quinn, part of it was phenomenal. We just established a lot of the foundations of continents.

Speaker 1:          00:12:23       Uh, and so it was, it one of the most incredibly influential papers. But you'd go back and read that paper and another sort of Ho half of the paper was about other stuff, right? Transducers and so on. Dennis, much less use and so and so is fine if you read a paper and some of it doesn't make sense because it's not that unusual. Well sometimes it just happens that, um, great research means we're publishing things are the boundaries of our knowledge. And sometimes, uh, the stuff you see, you know, we'll realize five years in the future that that wasn't the most important thing off there. All right. Well that the, what was the key part of the Ahhbra maybe wasn't what the author's thought. And so sometimes it pops paper don't make sense is okay to skip it initially and move on. Right? So, uh, unless you're trying to do a peak, unless you're trying to do the research and really you need to master it, then go ahead and spend more time. But they're trying to get through a lot of the papers then, you know, then Dennis, just prioritizing your time. Okay. Um, and so, uh, just a few last things and then I'll ask you to practice this yourself with a paper, right. Um, you know, I think that when you've read and understood the paper,

Speaker 2:          00:13:29       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       Decent questions to try to keep in mind and when you eat a paper, then a few minutes maybe and try to answer these questions. One thing you also has tried to accomplish, why the hope to do in a few minutes is asking you to download the paper off the Internet. We did. And then, um, try to answer these questions and discuss your answer to these questions with, with your peers. Read with others in the class. Okay. Um,

Speaker 2:          00:13:57       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:00       What were the key elements?

Speaker 2:          00:14:14       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:20       What can you use yourself and, um,

Speaker 2:          00:14:36       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:14:42       Okay. So I think of you can answer these questions. Hopefully that will reflect that you have a pretty good understanding of the paper. Okay. Um, and so what I would like you to do is pull up your laptop. And then, so you know, there's actually a, so I think on the confident videos, right on the Dev land, our AI concept videos and Coursera, you learned a bit about um, uh, various neural network architectures up to it resonates and it turns out that there's another, a follow on piece of work. There may be builds on some of the ideas of resonance, which is called dense nets. So what I'd like you to do is, um, oh, and so when did I can do is actually try this and when I'm reading a paper again in the earliest stages, don't get stuck on the map. Just go ahead and skim the math and the English texts we get through faster.

Speaker 1:          00:15:35       Uh, and maybe one of the principles is go from the very efficient high information content for us and then go to the harder material later. It is why often now just skimmed a map. And I don't, if I don't understand the similar integration, just move on and then they'll only data go back and, and really try to figure out the map more carefree. Okay. So one of the lecture they do is take on a, why don't you take, um, uh, uh, winter of uh, let's, let's, let's try it. Let's, let's have you take seven minutes where I'm thinking maybe one, one minute per occasion, quite fast. And search for this paper, densely connected. Convolutional neural net, net works by Warhol as Oh, okay. Why should I stick out your laptops? A searcher. This paper, a download, it is refined is on archive. Um, ar XIV. Right. And uh, and it, this is also something that you also called his dense net. So yes.

Speaker 1:          00:16:43       Um, and go ahead and take, why don't you take like seven minutes? So we just paper and I'll let you know when the time has passed. And then after that time, um, I liked you to, you know, discuss with your, with the others, right. What, what, what you think are the answers, especially in the first two, because the other two you can leave off. Why don't you go ahead and take a few minutes to do that now and then I'll let you know when, um, so the like seven minutes of pass and then you can discuss your answers with these with your friends. Okay. All right guys. So, um, anyone with any thoughts or insights or surprises or thoughts from this? So now you've spent 11 minutes on this paper, right? Seven minutes of eating for minutes. Discussing is really, really short period of time. But any, any thoughts or do you think of the paper going, you're, you're just spending lots of counseling, offsetting each other. W W what do people think of the time you spend trying to read the paper?

Speaker 3:          00:17:58       Actually they should tell you how I should raise your hand if you, a few of, you know, you kind of understood the main concepts in the camper just a bit, 2000 linear feet and actually requesting to the figures.

Speaker 2:          00:18:21       Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:18:21       Wow. People are really less than average, I think today than usual. Everyone. So I think this is one of those papers where, um, the, the paper is almost, it's how you summarize, uh, figures one and two, right? I think if you got to see a lot of people now if you look at figure of one and the caption the

Speaker 1:          00:18:45       on page three and the caption there and understand those two figures, those really convey, you know, 80% of the idea of the paper. All right. Um, and I think that uh, um, a couple of other tips. So, um, it turns out that as you read these papers, what practice you do get faster. So, um, for example, table one a on page four, right? You know, this mess of a table on top, this is a pretty common format or a format like this is how a lot of authors use to distract a network architecture, especially in computer vision. So one of the things that you find as well is that, um, the first time you see something like Table One, it just looks really complicated. But by the time you've read a few papers in the similar format, you build, look at Table One, then go, oh, Yep, got it.

Speaker 1:          00:19:34       Yeah, this is, this is, this is the dentist at one 21%, just one 69 architecture. And be with them more quickly. Pick up those things. And so another thing you find is that I'm meeting these papers actually gets better with practice because you see different authors use different ways on some of the ways of expressing themselves and the kids used to that you guys should be faster and faster at implementing these, um, at, at, at understanding these ideas. And I think these days we're not reading a paper like this and maybe it takes me about half an hour to two if you'd like. And I, I know I gave you guys seven minutes when I thought I would need maybe half an hour to figure out a people like this. Uh, um, uh, and I think, uh, for a more, I find that a, it's not unusual for people, relatively new to machine learning to maybe an hour to kind of, you know, really understand that paper like this.

Speaker 1:          00:20:21       Um, and then I'll know I'm pretty experienced machine learning and some downs have maybe half an hour for people like this, maybe even 20 minutes. It was a really easy one, but there are some outliers, so I have some colleagues, so sometimes it stumped by crowds are really difficult paper. You need to chase a lot of references and then love on this now. So sometimes you come across a paper that takes you three or four hours or even longer to really understand it. But, uh, but I think depending on how much time do you want to spend probate, reading papers, um, you could actually learn, you know, learn a lot rights, um, uh, doing what you just did, but maybe spending half an opera paper and our paper rather than seven minutes. Right. Um, so, all right. I feel like, uh, yeah, it was, and notice that I've actually not said anything about the content of this paper, right? So whatever you guys just learned, that was all you, I had nothing to do with it. So you know that y'all have the ability to go and learn this stuff by yourself. You don't need me anymore. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:21:23       So just a last few comments. Um, let's see. So the other few can, he'd ask questions I get is, uh, you know, where, where do you go? The deep learning a few of evolves so rapidly. So where, where do you go to? So if you're trying to master a new body of knowledge, definitely do web searches and they're often good blog posts on the, oh, she had the most important papers in speech recognition. There are lots of great resources there. And then the other thing you, I don't know, love people try one to do is try to keep up with the state of yard of deep learning even as it's evolving rapidly. And so I just tell you where I go to keep up with, um, you know, discussions, announcements, a surprising the Twitter is becoming an surprisingly important place for researchers to find out about new things.

Speaker 1:          00:22:12       Um, there's a m l sub reddit is actually pretty good. Um, lots of noise for many important pieces of where do get mentioned there. Some of the top machine learning conferences are nips ICML and I clear. All right. Uh, and so whenever these conferences come around, take a look and glance through at least the title, see if it's something that interests you. And then I think, unfortunately, I guess, um, friends, you know, um, uh, both colleagues here at Stanford as, as colleagues to several of the teams I work with that um, uh, uh, that, just tell me where there's a cool paper I guess, but I think with here with in Stanford or among your workplace, for those of you taking this NSTP DDP and form a community that shares interesting papers. So lot of the groups I have are on slack and we regularly slack each other.

Speaker 1:          00:23:02       I'll send, send each other a text messages on the slack messaging system. We find interesting papers that, that's been great for me actually. Um, yeah. Oh, and, and Twitter. Let's see. Ken Is, I follow Keon you could follow him to, this is me, Andrew wine, right. Um, I prayed on slack or papers as often as I do, but if you look at, I don't know, you can also look at who we follow them. There are a lot of good researchers that then we'll share all these things online. And um, there, there's a bunch of people, they also use a website called archive sanity. Um, I don't ask much sometimes, um, but, but loss of resources like that. Great. Um, cool. So just two last tips for how to be papers in good, good at this.

Speaker 1:          00:23:58       Um, so it's a more deeply understand the paper. Some of the papers will have math in it and actually if Vieta I'll know y'all learned about bashing. All right. And uh, um, a second module is videos. If you read the bashing on paper is actually one of the harder papers he read. Um, uh, there's a lot of math in the derivation of bashed. No, but their papers like that. And if you want to make sure you understand the math, here's what I would recommend, which is a read through it, take detailed notes and then see if you can read, derive it from scratch.

Speaker 1:          00:24:34       So if you want to deeply understand the math of an algorithm, like, you know, fashion or more the details of backdrop or something. Um, the good practice and I think a lot of, um, uh, uh, sort of a theory, a thorough company, signs and mathematics PhD students, we use a practice ideas which just go ahead and read the paper, make sure you understand it. And then to Mitchell, you really, really understand it. Put a p, put aside the results and try to re derive the math yourself from scratch. And if you can start from a blank piece of paper and read derived one of these algorithms and stretch. And that's a good side and you really understood it. When I was a phd student, I did this a lot, right? Um, that, you know, I would read a textbook or read the paper or something and then put aside whether I read and see if I could read the revive it from scratch starting from a blank piece of paper as only if I could do that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:22       Did I, would you have a few like, Yep. I think I understand this piece of math. Um, and it turns out if you want me to do this type of map yourself, is your ability to derive this type of math redirect, this type of math that gives you the ability to generalize, to derive new novel pieces of math yourself. So I think I actually learned the after math of several machine learning by doing this and this by the riving other people's work that allowed me to learn how to divide my own novel algorithms. And actually sometimes you go to the art galleries, right? They go to the Smithsonian, you see, these aren't students, you know, sitting on the floor. I'm copying the great artworks, the great paintings painted by the masses so centuries ago. And so I think just as a today, there are students sitting in or the de Young Museum or whatever, every or, and I was at the Getty Museum in La a few months ago.

Speaker 1:          00:26:13       You actually see these aren't citizens, you know, copying the work or the masters. And I think a lot of the ways that you want to become good at the math of machine learning yourself, uh, this is, this is a good way to do it. It's time consuming, but then you can become good at it that way. And same thing for cones rates. I think the, um, simple, lightweight version one of learning would be to download and run to open source code if you can find it. And a deeper way to learn this material is to reimplement it scratch,

Speaker 2:          00:26:50       right?

Speaker 1:          00:26:50       It's easy to download an open source thing and rather than this, Ooh, it works. But if you can implement one of these albums from scratch, then that's a strong scientist you've really understood. Does Alfred. Okay. Um, all right. And then longer term advice,

Speaker 2:          00:27:19       right?

Speaker 1:          00:27:24       You know, you'd say keep on learning and keep on getting better and better. The more important thing is for you to learn steadily, not for you to have a focus, intense activity. You know, like, uh, all the Thanksgiving you read 50 papers over Thanksgiving and then you're done for the rest of your life. It doesn't work like that. Right. And I think you actually much better our reading to a few papers a week for the next year then, you know, cramming everything right over over one long weekend or something. Oh, actually in education we're actually known in the space repetition where I sweat in the traveling. So, uh, the same, same thing, same body of learning. If you learn a bit every week and space it out, you actually have much better long term retention. Then you try to cram everything in the short term. So does, does a very solid result that we know from pedagogy and how the human brain world.

Speaker 1:          00:28:09       So, so if you're able to, um, so, so again, the way I, my life is my backpack. I just always have a few papers with me. I'm going to find that again. I've read almost everything on the tablet, on almost everything on an iPad, but they find that research papers and all those things where the ability to flip the team pages and skim, I still find more efficient on paper. So, um, I read almost nothing on paper these days except for research papers. But that's just me. Your mileage may vary. Maybe something else will work. Okay. All right. Um, so let's see. That's if I read a recent papers, I hope that while you're in CSU 30, you know, by the way, if some of you find some cool papers, I've you have, go further for the dense that paper and find an interesting result there.

Speaker 1:          00:28:51       Um, go ahead and post on Piazza or if any of you want to solve their reading group of other friends here at Stanford, you know, encourage you to look around class, fine, fine. Finally group here on campus or among your CSU 30 classmates, what were, we were all of your work colleagues for those of you taking this on their CPD so that you can all keep, you know, studying to so that you're sharing and learning and helping each other along. Okay. Um, so that's it for reading papers. Uh, the second thing want to do today is just give some longer term advice on navigating a career in, in, in machine learning. Right. Any questions about this before I move on?

Speaker 2:          00:29:34       Okay, cool. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:29:35       But I hope that was useful. Some of this I wish I had no when I was a first year phd student, but we'll see. All right. Um, let's see. Can we turn on the lights please? All right. All right. So kind of in response to requests from earlier citizen earlier versions of the clause before we, you know, as we approach the end of the quarter one, so it gives some advice, the housing navigator career machine learning, right? So, uh, today machine learning, there are so many opportunities to do so many exciting things. So, um, how do you, you know, what, what, what do you want to do? Um, so I'm going to assume that, um, most of you will want to do one of two things, right? At some point, you know, you want to, um, get the job right. Maybe a job that does work in machine learning, including a faculty position for those of you who I've been a professor. But I guess eventually most people end up with a job I think. Right? I guess there are other alternatives but, oh, but then some of you want to go on to more advanced graduate studies and it, although even after you get your phd at some point, most people do get the job after the Phd. Um, and, and, and by job, I mean, uh, either in the big company, you know, or as, or a startup, right? But regardless of the details of this, I think, I hope most of you wants to do important work.

Speaker 2:          00:31:02       Cool.

Speaker 1:          00:31:07       Great. So, um, what I like to do today is break, you know this into how's he find a job or join a phd program or whatever. I then lets you do important work and I want to break this discussion into two steps. One is just, you know, how, how do you get that position, right? How do you get that job off pharaoh? How do you get that offer of admissions in a PhD program? Oh, meshes in the master's program or whatever you want to do. Um, and then two, is that selecting a position?

Speaker 2:          00:31:44       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:31:45       right. Have a teen, you know, going to this university of has that university or which in taking on the job in this company for that company, what are the ones that will tend to set you up for success for long term crystal success and career success? Uh, and, and really I hope that by the way, I hope that all of these, I just tactics to let you do important work, right? I know these, I hope that's what you want to do. Um, so you know what the recruiters look for.

Speaker 1:          00:32:13       Oh. And I think just to keep the language simpler, I'm going to pretend that I'm just going to talk about finding a job. But a lot of the very similar things apply for PHD programs. It's just instead of saying recruiters, I would say admissions committees, right? Then it's actually, some of this is, this is they've just focused on the job scenario. So most recruiters love for technical skills. Uh, so for example, um, there are a lot of, um, uh, machine learning. They'll ask you questions like, you know, well, would you use grid into sands or bachelor and sand? The, the consequences, our bachelor's and what happens in the batch size is too large or too small, right? So there are companies, many companies today asking questions like that in the interview process. Uh, Oh, can you explain? There was an LCM and the Gru and where would you use on? So you really get questions like that in many job interviews today. And so recruits is looking for ml skills, uh, as well as, and so you often be quizzed on ml skills as well as our, um, your coding ability. Right? Um, and then beyond your, and, and I think Silicon Valley has become quite good at giving people the assessments to test for real skill in machine learning, engineering and software engineering. Um, and then the other thing they're recruiters will look for that many recruiters will look for is a meaningful work.

Speaker 1:          00:33:38       And in particular, um, uh, you know, they're all, some candidates that apply for jobs that have very, um, uh, theoreticals. They're very academic skills. Meaning you can answer all the quiz questions about, you know, what is bash norm, can you, they're arguing December this, but unless you've actually show him that you can apply this and meaningful setting, it's harder to convince a company or recruiter that, you know, not just a theory but they, you know, how to actually make this stuff work. And so, um, having done meaningful work using machine learning is a very strong, it's a very desirable candidate, I think to a lot of companies kind of work experience. And I think really whether you've done, whether you've done something meaningful, um, reassures that you know, that you can actually do work right. It's not just economic quiz questions, but you know how to implement during the algorithms that work. Um, and, and, and maybe, um, uh, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:34:37       Um, and in many recruiters actually look for your ability to keep on learning new skills and stay on top of machine learning and even see you've asked as well. And so a very common pattern for the, um, successful, you know, AI engineers say machine learning engineers would be the following where on the horizontal axis I applied to different areas. So you might learn about machine learning, learn about deep learning, learn about probabilistic graphical models, learn about NLP, learn about computer vision and so on for other areas of Ai and machine learning. Um, and if the vertical area, if the vertical axis is death, a lot of the strongest candidate, so jobs are t shaped individuals, meaning that you have a broad understanding of many different topics in the AI and machine learning and very deep understanding in, you know, maybe at least one area, maybe more than one the area. Um, and so I think by taking assist two 30 and doing the things you're doing, if you're a, hopefully you're acquiring a deeper understanding of one of these areas of deep learning in particular. Um, but the other thing that, uh, even, you know, uh, deepens their knowledge in one area will be the projects you work on, the open source contributions you make, right? Uh, whether or not you've done search, um, and maybe whether or not you've done an internship.

Speaker 1:          00:36:06       And I think these two elements, you know, broad area of skills and then also going deeper to do a meaningful project and deep learning or work of a Stanford professor, right? Oh, and do a meaningful research project or a mix, some contributions to open source publishing like Github and there, let's use it. These are the things that you deepen your knowledge and convince recruiters that you both have the broad technical schools and when called on, you're able to apply these in a, in a, in a meaningful way to an important problem, right? And in fact, um, the way we design cs two 30 is actually a microcosm of this where, um, you know, you learned about neuro nets, um, learn about topics. They're bashed norm confidence, a sequence models, right? And just say rns. So actually have a breath within the field of deep learning.

Speaker 1:          00:36:59       And then what happens is no then, and the reason why is you to work on the project is so that you can pick one of these areas and maybe go deep and build a meaningful project and one of these areas, uh, which will, which war. And it's not just about making a resume look good, right? This is about giving you the practical experience to make sure you actually know how to make these things work, um, uh, and give you the learnings to make sure that you actually know how the make of CNN work. You look at our and then work. Uh, and then coincidentally the many students also this depression and the resume's obviously. Um, so I think the, um, let's see, the, the, the failure modes, the things, bad ways to navigate your career. Um, there are some students that just do this, right?

Speaker 1:          00:37:49       There are some Stanford students that just take class off the cost off the costs, off the clos, and go equally in depth in a huge range of areas. And this is not terrible. You can actually still get a job. Uh, uh, you know, so get, sometimes you can even get into some phd programs like this without the Def, but this is not the best way to navigate your career, right? So there are some stem physicians who's, that takes tons of classes. You didn't get a good GPA doing that, but do nothing else. And this is not terrible, but this is, this is not, this is not great as it's not as good as the alternative. Um, there's one other thing I've seen Stanford students do, which is, uh, just try to do that, right? Which is just try to jump in on day one and go really, really deep in one area.

Speaker 1:          00:38:33       And again, um, this has its own challenges, I guess. You know, one, one, one, one failure mode. One mode is actually not great. It's sometimes where she get, um, uh, undergrad freshmen at Stanford that have not yet learned a lot about coding or software and dream or machine learning and tried to jump into research project right away. And this turns out not to be very efficient because it turns out Stanford Causes, uh, you know, online causes a Stanford closet. There a very efficient way for you to learn about the broad range of areas and after that great deeper getting experience in one vertical area then deepens your knowledge and makes sure, you know, how they actually meet those ideas work. Uh, so I do see sometimes, unfortunately, you know, sent some Stanford freshman join us already knowing how the code and have implemented, you know, some learning our rooms, but some students that do not yet have much experience tried to jump into research project right away.

Speaker 1:          00:39:22       And that turns out not to be very productive for the student or for the research group because until you've taken the courses and mass, the basics is difficult to understand what's really going on at the advance projects. Right. Um, so I would, I would say this is actually worse than that. Right. This is this is that, okay. This is actually pretty bad. This is, I, I will not do this for your career, right? No, probably not. Yeah. Um, and then the other not so great mode that you see some San business do is get a lot of breath and then do a tiny project here and do a tiny project there. I do a tiny project there, do a tiny project there and you end up with 10 tiny projects but no one or two really significant project. Cause then again this is not terrible, but you know, beyond a certain point by the way recruiters and not impressed by volume.

Speaker 1:          00:40:16       Right? So having done 10 lane projects is actually not impressive, not nearly as impressive as doing one great project or two great projects. And again, there's more to life than impressing recruiters, but recruits is very rational. And the reason recruiters are less impressed by someone whose profile looks like this, it is because they're actually probably factually less skilled and less able at doing good work in machine learning compared to someone that, that has done their substantive project and knows what it takes to see, see the whole thing through. Does that make sense? So when I say, you know, recruiters more or less impressive because they're actually quite rational in terms of trying to understand how good you are at, um, uh, at, at, at doing important work and building meaningful AI systems. Can you sense, um, and so in terms of building up all the horizontal piece and the vertical piece, uh, this is what I recommend to build the horizontal piece. Love of this is about building foundational skills. And, um, it turns out coursework as a very efficient way to do this. Uh, you know, in, in, in these causes, right? You know, various instructors, Lakers where many of the separate professors for the law, the work and to organizing the content and because efficient for you to learn this material. Um, and then also reading

Speaker 1:          00:41:37       research papers, which we just talked about having a community will help you. Um, and then that is often a building a more deep

Speaker 2:          00:41:51       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:41:54       And relevant project [inaudible] precious how to rather than, so you know, if you want to build a career at machine learning, could be liquor in the eye. Hopefully the project is something that's relevant to cs or machine learning or AI or deep learning. Um, I do see, I don't know, for some reason I feel like a surprisingly large number of stamps ins I know are the Stanford Don's true. And they spent a lot of time on that, which is fine. If you enjoy dancing, go have fun, don't you? You don't need to work all the time. So going, joined a dance to or go on the overseas exchange program and go hang out in London and have fun. But those things do not as directly contribute to this. Right. Yeah, I know. I think, I think in the earlier version of this presentation, yeah. Stairs walked away saying, Huh, you know, Andrea says we should not have fun. It should work all the time and that's not the girl.

Speaker 2:          00:42:51       Um, all right, there is one. All right. Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:16       You know, there is the,

Speaker 2:          00:43:20       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:43:21       Saturday morning problem, which all of you will face, which is every week, uh, including this week on Saturday morning you'll have a choice. Um, you can, uh, read the paper.

Speaker 2:          00:43:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:44       What kind of research or working on open source or I don't know why people do or you could watch TV or something and you were facing a choice maybe every Saturday, you know, for the rest of your life or for loss, Adam days and the rest of your life. And, um, you know, you can build out that foundation skills, go deep or go have fun and you should have fun. All right, let's go the record. But one of the problems that a lot of people face is that even if you spend all Saturday and all Sunday reading a research paper, um, you know, the following Monday or maybe spend all Saturday and Sunday working hard, it turns out that the following Monday you're not that much better at deep learning is like, yeah, you work really. So you read five papers, you know, great. Uh, but if your work have a research group, the professor or your, you know, or your manager, if you're in the company, they have no idea how hard you work.

Speaker 1:          00:44:41       So there's no one to come by and say, Oh, good job working so hard all weekend. So no one knows the sacrifices you may all weekend to study or code open soles in Poland is this, no one knows. So there's almost no short term reward to doing these things. Um, but the C and whereas they might be short term rewards to doing other things. Right. Um, uh, but the secret to this is that it's not about reading papers really, really hot for one Saturday morning or for all Saturday once and then being done. The secret to this is to do this consistently, um, you know, for years, um, or at least a month's. And it turns out that if you read two papers a week and you do that for a year, then you will have read 50 papers after a year and you will be much better at teaching learning off of that.

Speaker 1:          00:45:29       Right? Uh, I mean, when you read your read 100 papers in the year of UV two papers a week and, uh, and so as, so for you to be successful as much less about the intense burst of effort you put in over one weekend, it's much more about whether you can find a little bit of time every week to read a few papers or crunch. We have a bit of open source or take someone I causes AV, but, and if you do that, you know, every week for six months, so do that every week for a year, you've will actually learned a lot about these views and be much better and be much more capable at deep learning or machine learning or whatever. Right. Um, yeah. So, um, yeah, and, but yeah, it actually has essentially my, my, my wife and I actually do not own a TV for what a soar. But again, if you, if if you, oh my, go ahead. It's fine. Make sure it don't, don't, don't, don't drive yourself crazy. And the healthy work life integration as well.

Speaker 1:          00:46:28       All right. So, um, so I hope that doing these things well, it's not about finding a job is about doing these things to make you more capable as a machine learning person so that you have the power to garden, implement stuff that matters to stuff that you do, do work that matters. Well, the second thing which had about, is selecting a job and it's actually really interesting. Um, I, uh, gave this part of the presentation, um, last year, uh, actually, sorry, earlier this year and shortly after that presentation, um, there was a student in the class, there was already in a company who emailed me saying, boy, Andrew, I wish you had told me this before. I said to my current job. Um, so let's see. Let's see, let's see. Hopefully this will be useful to you. Um, so it turns out that, um, uh, you know, so at some point you're at, you're deciding, you know, what phd problem do you wanna apply for? What companies do want as high for a job ads? And, um, I can tell you what, uh, well, so if you want to keep learning new things, um, I think one of the biggest predictors of your success will be whether or not you're working with great people and projects.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       Right? And in particular, um, you know, there, there are these fascinating results from, uh, uh, I think, I want to say from the social sciences showing that, um, if your closest friends, if your five closest friends who are 10 closest friends are all smokers, there isn't much high shine as you become a smoker as well. Right? And if you're five or 10 close friends are, um, uh, uh, you know, overweight as much high chance you would do the same. Or conversely it does, uh, um, you know, so I think that if your five closest friends work really hard, really long research papers, care about their work, uh, learning and making themselves better, then that's actually a very good chance that you will be, that they'll influence you that way as well. So we're all human. We all influenced by the people around us, right? And so, um, I think that, and I've been fortunate, I've taught at Stanford for a long time now.

Speaker 1:          00:48:44       It's, I've been fortunate to have seen a lot of students go from Stanford to various careers and because I've seen how many hundreds or maybe low thousands of Stanford students that I knew right when there was still statuses go on to separate job, I sold many of them have amazing careers. Um, I saw, you know, a few have like, like, okay careers. Um, but I think over time I've learned to pattern match what is predictive of your future success after the staff. And then we share with you somethings, pat share with you some of those patterns as you navigate your career. And, and, and it's just, there's so many options in machine learning today. It's kind of tragic if you don't, you know, navigate to to hopefully maximize the chance of being one of the people that gets to do fun and important work that helps, helps others.

Speaker 1:          00:49:27       Um, so when selecting a position, um, I would advice you to focus on the team. Um, you interact with and by team I mean, you know, somewhere between 10 to 30 persons rent, maybe up to 50. Um, because it turns out that if, if, if you, um, there will be some group of people, maybe 10 to 30 people, maybe 50 people that you interact with quite closely, and these will be your peers and the people that influence you the most, right? Um, because if you join a company with 10,000 people, you will not interact with all 10,000 people. There will be a core of 10 or 30 or 50 people that you interact with the most. And is those people how much they know, how much she didn't teach you, how hardworking they are, whether they are learning themselves that will influence you the most rotted and all these other hypothetical 10,000 people in the giant company.

Speaker 1:          00:50:30       Um, and of these people, one of the ones that will influence you the most is uh, your manager, right? So make sure you meet your manager and get to know them and make sure there's someone you want to work with. Um, and in particular, I would recommend focusing on these things and not on the brand of the company because it turns out that the brand of the company you work with is actually not that correlates it. Yeah, maybe there's a very weak correlation, but there's actually not that correlated with what your personal experience will be like. Oh, it makes sense. Right? Um, and so, um, and, and by the way, again, just, you know, full disclosure on one wheel, I have a research group here at Stanford, right? My recent career, Stanford is one of the better known researchers in the world. But just don't join us because you think we're well known, right? It's this, it's just not a good reason to join some of the brands. Instead, you're only work with someone, meet the people and evaluate the individuals or look at the people and see if you think these are people you can learn from a worker and a good people.

Speaker 2:          00:51:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       So, um,

Speaker 1:          00:51:56       so in today's world, there are a lot of companies, um, recruiting Stanford students. So let me give you some advice. In this piece of volume are good because many as well, I just give the advice. So sometimes there are giant companies with let's say, um, uh, uh, you know, 50,000 people, right? And I'm not thinking of any one specific company if you're trying to get so confidence in golf, there's no one specific company I'm thinking of, but this pattern matches, uh, to many large companies, but maybe there's a giant company with 50,000 people, right? And that say that they have a 300 person, right? Ai Team. Um, it turns out that if you look at the work of the few and depressing the I team and if they send you a job offer to join to 300% of the it team, that might be pretty good, right?

Speaker 1:          00:52:54       This is, this may be a group, you know, whose work you hear about their potions papers. You really want a news. Um, and so if you can a job offer to work with this group that might be pretty good or even better, would be sometimes even within the 30%, the Itm is actually difficult to tell what's good and what's not. There's often a lot of errands, even with this was even better, would be if you get a job offer to join the 30 person team. So you actually know who's your manager, who your peers, who you're working with. And if you think these are 30 great people you can learn from, that could be a job offer on the failure mode that unfortunately, I've seen several Stanford students go down there and say, actually, this is a true story. Uh, there was ones, uh, several years ago as a San Franciscan, I knew that, I thought it was a great guy.

Speaker 1:          00:53:37       Right? You know, I, I knew his work. He was Kodak machine there in the outer rooms. I thought he was very sharp and did very good work. Uh, working with some of my phd students. He got a job offer from one of these giant companies with that has a great AI group. Um, and his Alpha wasn't to go to the AI group is offer was to join us and there was sign you to a team. So this, pick the student that was this emphasis and I know about and the kind of care about, um, he wound up being assigned to really boring a Java or backend payments team. And, uh, so after you set the job offer, he wound up being assigned to a, you know, back in and apologize Emma, you work on Java backend payment processing systems. I think they're great. But the student was assigned to that team and he was really bored.

Speaker 1:          00:54:24       And so, um, I think that this was a student whose career I perceive, so has career rising while he was at Stanford and after he went to this, frankly not very interesting team, I saw his career plateau. Um, and after about a year and a half, he resigned from this company after wasting a year and a half of his life and missing out really on a year and a half of this very exciting growth of AI and machine learning. Right? So it does. Very unfortunate. Um, uh, and, and Oh, it was actually after I told this story last time I taught this class earlier this year that actually someone from, um, uh, actually was actually from the same big company you felt Mina said by Andrea. Wish she told me the story earlier because this is exactly what happened to me at the same big company.

Speaker 1:          00:55:12       Now I want to share with you, uh, a different, um, so, so I would just be careful about rotation programs as well. You know, when a company is trying to recruit you, if a company refuses to tell you what projects you work on, who is your manager exactly what team you're joining, I proceed. Do not find those job offers that attractive because, uh, it, the con, you know, if they refuse to tell you what team are going to work with while chances are right, tell me the answer will not make the job attractive to you. That's why they're not telling you. So just be very careful. And sometimes rotation programs sound good on paper, but it's really, you know, well, we'll figure out where to send you later. So I feel like I've seen some students go into rotation programs that sound good on paper.

Speaker 1:          00:55:58       That sounds like a good idea. But just as you would in [inaudible] Stanford would you want to do for internships and then apply for a job, there'll be a weird thing to do. So sometimes rotation permits out, Yo come and do for internships and they will let you apply for a job and see where we were when I sent you. And it could be Java backend payment processing system, right? So, um, uh, so just, just be cautious about the marketing of rotation programs. Oh, and again, if you do, but if, but if they, what they say is do rotation and then you joined this team, then you can look at this team and say, Yep, that's a great team. I want to do a rotation. But then I would go and work with this team and these are the 30 people worker. So that could be great.

Speaker 1:          00:56:36       But during rotation, then you could send you anywhere in this giant company that I would just be very careful if, all right. Um, now on the flip side, they're awesome companies and I'm not going to mention any companies, but there are some companies where you though are not as glamorous. Now, there's not as right cool brands. Um, and maybe this is a Oh no 10,000 person company, 1000 or 50,000 per second or whatever, unless it's 10,000 for a coffee. I have seen many companies that are not super well known in the AI world. They're not in the news all the time, but they may have a very elite team of a hundred people doing great work in machine learning. Right? And there are definitely companies whose brands and not, you know, the first company you would think of when you think of great AI companies, um, that sometimes they have a really, really great 10 person or 50 person, a 100 person team that works under, in the algorithms.

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       And even if the overall brand, the overall company, you know, isn't as like, as a little bit sucky, if you manage to track down this team and if you have a job offer to join this team in a much bigger company, you could actually learn a lot from these people and do important work. You know, one of the things about silicon valley is that, um, the brand on your resume matters lesson less, right? Less than ever before. I mean, I guess, Oh, I think, uh, uh, the exception of the Stanford brand, you're totally when the staff of grounded resume, but with that exception, they're really, your silicon valley's become really good. Sorry, the, the world, right? It has become really good at evaluating people for your genuine technical schools and your genuine capability and less for your brands. Um, and so I would recommend that instead of trying to get the best stamps of approval on your resume to go and tick the positions, they let you have the best learning experiences and also allows you to do the most important work.

Speaker 1:          00:58:24       And that has really shaped by the, you know, 30 or 50 people you work with and not by the overall brand of the company you work with. Right. So the variants across, um, uh, so there's a huge variance across teams within one company, and that variance is actually pretty bigger or might be bigger than the veterans across different companies does make sense. So, so I would, and if a company refuses to tell you what team you rejoin, I would seriously consider just, you know, doing so if you have a better option, I would do something else. Um, and then finally, um, yeah, and, and so really, I, again, I, I guess I don't want to name these companies, but you know, think of some of the large retailers or some of the large healthcare systems or the lot of companies, uh, that are not well known in the Ai World, but that I've met the AI teams.

Speaker 1:          00:59:14       I think they're great. And so if you're able to find those jobs and meet their people, you can actually get very exciting jobs in here, right? Oh, but up cost for the giant companies that Evie I teams you can join that Uva, the my aunt. That's also, that's also a great, I'm a bit biased since I used to lead some of these team. So, so I think those things are great, but that's a, but also some teams in the, um, uh, yeah. All right. Um, lost sleep, you know, just general advice. This is how I really live my life. Um, I tend to choose the things to work on. They'll allow you to learn the most. Um, you know, we tried to do important work, so, you know, especially if you're a relative, the early in career, whether have you learn the, your career will pay off for a long time.

Speaker 1:          01:00:13       And so, um, uh, uh, and so joining the teams, they're working with a great set of 10 or 30 or 50 teammates will let you learn a lot. Um, and then also, you know, hopefully, I mean, yeah. And, and, and uh, and, and just don't, don't, don't join, uh, like a sacred company and hope, you know, give more people cancer or stuff like that. Or is this, don't, don't do this, don't do stuff like that. But if you can do meaningful worth, it helps other people and do important work, uh, uh, and also learn a lot on the way. Hopefully you can find positions site that, that, that, that lets you set, set yourself up for long term success. We'll also do work that you think matters and that it helps other people. All right. Um, any questions before we wrap up?

Speaker 3:          01:01:11       What's important? You know, I think one of the most meaningful things to do in life is help other people,

Speaker 1:          01:01:18       uh, either advance the human condition or help other people. But the thing is I'm nervous. I don't want to name one or two things because the world needs a lot of people who work in a lot of different things. So the world's not going to function if everyone works on computational biology. I think con bio is great, but it's actually good that where people work on come bio. My Phd students like, you know, uh, many work on the outside to healthcare. Uh, my team at landing AI does a lot of work on the outside to manufacturing to every culture, to some health care and some other industries. Um, uh, I actually, especially the California fires burning, you know, I actually think that there's important work to be done in AI and climate change. Uh, um, but I think that, uh, there's a log of them important work and a lot of industries, right?

Speaker 1:          01:02:02       So I should think that, you know, I actually think that the next wave of Ai sees me, I should say machine learning is with, we've already, um, transform a lot of the tech world. Right? Uh, uh, so, you know, yeah. I mean, we've already helped a lot of the second valley tech world become cadet AI and that's fate, right? Help build a cover of the teams. They wound up doing this, right? Google brain. How Google become good. The deep learning, the, by the way, I grew up hop, I do become, you know, good at one of the greatest, the I companies in the world. So the in China. Um, and I'm very happy that, uh, between me and some of my friends in the industry, we've made a lot of good AI companies. I think part of the next phase for the evolution of machine learning is Fred to go into not just the tech companies like, you know, like the Google and Baidu, which I hoped as well as, you know, Facebook, Microsoft, which had nothing to do with as well as, um, what else?

Speaker 1:          01:02:57       Airbnb, Pinterest, Rubella, right? All these are great companies. I hope they're all embrace AI, but I think some of the most exciting work to be done. So it was also look outside the tech industry, uh, and to look at all the, sometimes call them traditional industries that do not have shiny tech things because I think the value creation there as surprise, you could implement there maybe even bigger than if you, you know, uh, uh, uh, yeah. Uh, actually I, I mentioned one interesting thing. One thing I notice is a lot of the large tech companies, I'll work on the same problems, right? So everyone, we're a machine translation. Every Ross speech recognition, face detection at click through rate. And part of me feels like this is great because it means there's a lot of progress in machine translation and that's great. We do, I'm proud of the machine translation.

Speaker 1:          01:03:41       But sometimes when you look at other industries, um, so you know, when the look at manufacturing or um, uh, some of the medical devices, things working at odds or uh, sometimes they'll on these farms hanging out with farmers on, on, on, um, few like in my own work and my teams where sometimes we're stumbling across brand new research problems that the big tech companies do not see and have not yet learned to frame. So find one of the most intellectually exciting challenges is actually you to be constantly on the cutting age, uh, looking at these types of problems. There's a different cutting edge than the containers, the big tech companies. So I think some of you are joining the big tech companies and that's great. We need more AI and the big companies in the tech companies. But I think lot of exciting work to do in AI is also, um, outside what we traditionally consider the tech. Great. All right. US tent this whole fifties. So, hope, I hope this was helpful. Um, uh, and, uh, let's, let's break, visit. Oh, have a, have a great thanksgiving, everyone, and we'll see you in a couple of weeks.
