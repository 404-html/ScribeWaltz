1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,050
By the age of 24 Hermann Garing
was a famous combat pilots,

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:08,940
a national hero and leader of Germany's
most celebrated fighter squadron.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,240
By the time of his death,
less than 30 years later,

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:17,070
he was reviled as a monster with
the blood of millions on his hands,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,840
highly decorated combat pilot, drug
addicted, lunatic international statesmen,

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,020
and one of the 20th century's
most notorious criminals.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,790
Garren's life was one of
soaring highs and crashing lows.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,320
And in the biographics video this
week we explore the life of this man.

9
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,960
The young Hermann Goering
enjoyed a privileged upbringing.

10
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,940
His own mother and father had missile
money, but his Jewish Godfather,

11
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,940
Dr. Herman Epstein, was fabulously
wealthy and he welcomes the gehrings.

12
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:57,800
Do you live at one of his two castles?

13
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,400
This appearance acts of altruism was
no doubt influenced by the facts that

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,130
Epstein was having an
affair with gehrings mother.

15
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,490
If her mother was aware of this,
then he didn't seem to mind.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,660
The two became close with
Epstein Encouraging Hammon
and his love of hunting,

17
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:15,620
climbing, and adventure. When
Goering develops an interest
in all things military.

18
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:19,380
It was again his Jewish godfather who
pulled some strings to have the boy in

19
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:24,180
roles at the prestigious military
academy had calls row in 1914 the great

20
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:28,880
European powers when to war Garing was
by then 21 years old and serving in an

21
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,540
infantry regimens sensing that would
be better opportunities for glory.

22
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:33,230
Elsewhere.

23
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:38,230
He applied to join the imperial German
flying call and began his new career as

24
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:41,780
an observer, but when the opportunity
arose, do you get behind the controls?

25
00:01:41,781 --> 00:01:45,620
He seized it with both hands.
He proved to be a natural flyer.

26
00:01:45,621 --> 00:01:47,900
It's thanks to the countless
hours he'd spent hunting.

27
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,540
He was already a lethal marksman.

28
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,390
This was a deadly combination
for an aspiring combat pilot.

29
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,010
By October, 1915 bearing was newly
qualified and hungry for glory.

30
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,300
He only had to wait a little over a month
before he scored his first kill them.

31
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:03,710
By June,

32
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,850
1916 is Tali had risen to three a few
professions in history I've ever been

33
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:12,230
quite as dangerous as a world
war one pilot since in November,

34
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,050
1960 and he was shot down
for the first and only time.

35
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,780
Accounts of the incidents are
sketchy and contradictory,

36
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:19,090
but there's no doubt of that.

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,420
Gehring did suffer an injury that kept
him out of action for several months on

38
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:26,660
rezoning to DOTC begins or rack up kills.
It's an impressive rate.

39
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,890
He rose through the ranks of aces winning
numerous awards for bravery and just

40
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,150
fame began to grow.

41
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,560
His face was printed on
collectible matchboxes
newspapers and magazines featured

42
00:02:36,561 --> 00:02:40,880
articles on him. Everywhere
he went, people treated him
like a celebrity Gehring.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,650
He adored the attention.

44
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,300
In April 19 the Germans suffered a major
blow when their greatest pilot man read

45
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,350
Ron Rec. Seven better known to history as
the red baron was shot down and killed.

46
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,470
Race often had been commander of an elite
squadron made up of Germany's find a

47
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,180
stamina.

48
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,370
It was assumed that his replacement would
be drawn from their and the likes of

49
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,550
earnest Udit and Luther von Rick.

50
00:03:02,551 --> 00:03:06,400
Seven the red baron's brother were
considered the most likely candidates,

51
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,030
but as it turned out, he was actually
Hermann Goering who landed the job.

52
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,390
This game is something
of a surprise guttering.

53
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,770
He hasn't been part of the rector,
often squadron,

54
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:18,730
and he was still some way off the top
of the charts in terms of Kilz. However,

55
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,780
Garren had skill, he had charm, and
he seemed to be a natural leader.

56
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,380
Gehring took charge of the rich
often squadron, a difficult time.

57
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,640
The balance of power in the ad swung
back and forth through the war,

58
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:34,090
but now the allies were
firmly in the ascendancy.

59
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,390
German aircraft production couldn't
keep up with the British and French

60
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:38,170
factories,

61
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,890
attrition and exhaustion where taking
their toll on German pilots as well.

62
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,560
The situation on the grounds,
it was equally desperate.

63
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,390
Shortly before gehrings promotion,

64
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:49,420
the United States of America
had declared war on Germany.

65
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,530
A huge offensive designed to knock France
out of the war before American troops

66
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,660
arrived in any great numbers fails.

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,610
Germany suit for peace and the armistice
came into a, on the 11th of November,

68
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,810
1918 gehrings lost orders were to lead
his squadron to a French Sheffield with

69
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,281
Iraq.

70
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:10,330
Croft would be handed over to the allies
in a tearful final speech to his men.

71
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,720
He predicted our time will come again.

72
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,760
Gatherings,
exploits made him a household name,

73
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,820
but he missed the excitement
that the war had provided.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,770
Recruiting for other pilots from amongst
his wartime comrade see put on a series

75
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:32,870
of highly dangerous acrobatic shows,

76
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:37,250
dazzling thousands of onlookers with
his daring stunt flying when the public

77
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:40,760
began to lose their appetite for this
sort of spectacle called took on a more

78
00:04:40,761 --> 00:04:42,500
modest job flying charter planes.

79
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,520
It was during this time that he met the
love of his life counters. Karen Vaughn.

80
00:04:46,521 --> 00:04:49,550
Farc was sickly and frail
and already married,

81
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:54,080
but she was also wealthy and beautiful.
The guttering, it was love at first sight.

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,861
Karen,

83
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:59,030
she felt the same way about the dashing
m and and in 1922 she abandoned her

84
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:02,810
husband's and a child to make a
new life with Gehring in Munich.

85
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,280
It was here that the couple
of first encountered adults.

86
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,380
Hitler at this point in history hit
though is still something of a non entity

87
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:14,210
rabble rousing demagogue with missile
real power influence Karen. However,

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,890
she was in trust and she was determined
to form an alliance between Gehring and

89
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:23,430
this Austrian corporal Gehring willingly
bounties face to that of ad off Hitler

90
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,220
ends in November of 1923 he joined
his Mazda and a plot to overthrow the

91
00:05:28,221 --> 00:05:28,790
government.

92
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:33,260
2000 Nazis with Hitler and Goering side
by side and the front rank marched on

93
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:37,280
the Bavarian war ministry hitting the
believed the police would not oppose them,

94
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:39,350
but you underestimated their resolve.

95
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,850
They opened fire and hit the foul or by
some accounts fledge while gathering was

96
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,320
badly wounded by a bullet to his thigh.
Hitler and his conspirators,

97
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,830
they went now wanted criminals and this
was a particularly difficult situation

98
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:55,910
for Gehring since he was one of the most
recognizable faces in all of Germany.

99
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,410
While Hillary was arrested,

100
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,920
Gehring chose to flee having received
treatment from ironically enough,

101
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,460
a Jewish doxa Gehring and carrying
across the Austrian border.

102
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:08,450
The next two years would be the
most miserable of gehrings life.

103
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,720
Gehrings wound became badly,
in fact, done in Austria.

104
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,150
He was given injections of
morphine to ease the pain.

105
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,950
This was the beginning of an addiction
that would almost cost Gehring his sanity

106
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,210
and even his life, the ones athletic
ace pilots way you said balloons,

107
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,380
Karen and sold most of her possessions
to fund gehrings habits and just wild

108
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,810
mood swings after fearing for her life,

109
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,460
faced with the very real possibility of
losing Karen airing agreed to enter into

110
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,830
a withdrawal or a program
during the great war,

111
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,480
the first battle of gehrings life,

112
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,770
he had fought for his country for
personal glory and for Prestige is second

113
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:46,220
grade struggle against morphine.
Addiction had none of that glamour.

114
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,500
It was a feisty,
very night he lost.

115
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,280
He screamed at his nurse is that they
wanted to meet death and even attempted to

116
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,450
physically attack them for his own safety
and the safety of everyone around him.

117
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,890
He was forced into a straight jacket
and confined to a padded cell to Karen's

118
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:04,400
relief. Gehring emerged from the
depths of his own personal highlands.

119
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:09,050
He was discharged from the asylum
in October of 1925 less than a year

120
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:09,531
afterwards.

121
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,640
The German government grounds at him
an amnesty absolving him of his crimes.

122
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,210
He was free to or a townhome and to
resume his service to add I'll Hitler who

123
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,910
would been himself released
after just nine months in prison,

124
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:22,730
having failed to gain
control of Germany by force,

125
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,910
Hitler instead attempted to seize
power through the ballot box.

126
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,140
In order to accomplish this,

127
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:31,850
he needed a wealthy back is to embrace
the nationalist socialist because Hitler

128
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:35,900
was a brilliant public speaker,
capable of whipping crowds into a frenzy,

129
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:40,040
but in more intimate social settings,
he was awkward and uncomfortable.

130
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,060
Most of the other senior Nazis
were unsophisticated thugs. Only.

131
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:49,090
Garing was entirely at home wining and
dining German society's elites gathering

132
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:53,590
that threw himself into his new role.
We've huge energy and commitments,

133
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,070
but his beloved Karen's health was
by now seriously deteriorating.

134
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:03,050
In October of 1931 she collapsed
and died leaving Gehring distraught.

135
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:07,880
He would later condition the building of
a huge country residence sets in 40,000

136
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,710
hectares of woodlands.
Naming it.

137
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:14,711
Karen hold in a memory in January of
1933 had succeeded in maneuvering himself

138
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:17,240
into the position of
Chancellor of Germany.

139
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,710
Gehrings reward for his years of service
was to be appointed Prussian Minister

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,570
of the interior through his ministerial
salary, corruption and bribes.

141
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,570
He founds the means to fund the lifestyle
that was becoming opulent to the point

142
00:08:29,571 --> 00:08:34,571
of absurdity to go along with his mansions
is exotic pets centers increasingly

143
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,810
ostentatious. The uniforms Gehring.
He also held real political power.

144
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,660
His first step was to
not certify the police,

145
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,420
sacking 22 police chiefs
and replacing them with men,

146
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:49,040
sympathetic national socialism with the
police loyalty or should he ordered them

147
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,920
to crush subversive elements in society,

148
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:54,470
which in practice meant
Jews and communists.

149
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,200
Gehring made no attempt to distance
himself from these killings.

150
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:02,970
He stages every bullet fired from the
barrels of a police pistol is my bullet.

151
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,150
If you call that murder
than I am a murderer.

152
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,470
Everything has been ordered by me.
The biggest threat to Hitler, however,

153
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,280
did not come from the communists but
from within the Nazi party itself,

154
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,430
the folks of the essay,
but Nazi parties own para military.

155
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,280
Army had been useful to hit
her when his rise to power,

156
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,120
but they'd become a bit of a problem.
Hitler wanted the essay to be broken up,

157
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:28,500
but its commander and rom openly
defied him. The men of the essay,

158
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:31,470
they were loyal to Ron.
If he attempted an armed cue,

159
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,590
he might just succeed in toppling hip
goring who hated Rahman's recognized a

160
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,400
very real threat to his own power.

161
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:43,401
He urged his fury at act and reluctantly
hypno agreed on June the 30th 1934 the

162
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:49,980
night of the long knives began. It was
time for Hitler to settle some old scores.

163
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,640
Now on Strom was arrested.
I'm shot dozens of those.

164
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,820
You had angered or obstructed
Hitler in one way or the other.

165
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:01,170
Much of the planning had been entrusted
to Guerin who executed the operation

166
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:05,040
with great skill and they
complete lack of moral scruples.

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,730
Headless position within the
party is now become unassailable,

168
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:12,240
but he was already looking forward to
the day when he could attack Germany's

169
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:16,200
neighbors and a venture to feet and
the Great Wall Germany was banned from

170
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,790
building an air falls under the
tons of the treaty of Versailles.

171
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,380
So Garing was tossed with
building a top in secret.

172
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:26,220
The Germans had been preparing for the
day when the air force would rise once

173
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:29,640
again since long before the
days of Hitler coming to power.

174
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,120
While Germans were barred from developing
military aircraft to the band on

175
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:36,540
civilian aircraft had been
lifted in 1922 since then,

176
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:40,860
the German aviation industry has produced
numerous fast mail carrying planes

177
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:44,460
that could easily be converted into
fighters and airline is that could be

178
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:47,880
converted into Obama's Lufthansa.
Germany's state owned airline,

179
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:52,560
which was formed in 1926 would provide
many of the pilots for gehrings fledgling

180
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:55,290
Luftwaffe that showers
with lavish funding.

181
00:10:55,291 --> 00:11:00,291
Gehrings fledgling Luftwaffen grew quickly
and in March of 1935 it's existence

182
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,780
was officially announced to the world.

183
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,240
Over the next four years.

184
00:11:11,241 --> 00:11:15,530
The Luftwaffe out red receive four times
as much investment as Britain's RF and

185
00:11:15,531 --> 00:11:18,230
it's more than 10 times that,
uh, France is our force.

186
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,970
Unlike the allied air forces,

187
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:24,440
it was designed specifically to operate
in support of Germany's ground forces.

188
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,880
The World Class Messerschmidt one oh
nine became operational in 1937 and it

189
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:31,940
forms the backbone of the
Luftwaffe as fighter force.

190
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,950
The drunk is Jua 87 stock,

191
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,250
a dive bomber rammed machine for which
neither the British nor the friendship

192
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,300
and he'd direct equivalents which provide
support of a Germany's fast moving

193
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:44,030
armored spearheads.
It's guttering later adult is captures.

194
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:47,990
In 1945 we arms Germany until we bristled.

195
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:51,890
Guttering didn't entirely share
Hitler's his enthusiasm for war.

196
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,660
And this wasn't due to any sense of
compassion for the millions who would die,

197
00:11:55,661 --> 00:12:00,010
but simply because handsy much to lose
his time was spent mixing with high

198
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,660
society,

199
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,450
indulging his passions for hunting and
collecting art and expanding his own

200
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,000
personal empire within the Reich.
Unlike Hitler,

201
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,590
he didn't see himself as being on some
sort of quasi divine mission to restore

202
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:12,460
German greatness.

203
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,270
He simply pursued a political career
because it brought him personal power and

204
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,540
enormous wealth. We're Hitler
thought victory was inevitable.

205
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,130
Gathering you it wasn't fair.
He might find himself on the losing side.

206
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,710
Just slide the reservations
of many of his generals.

207
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:30,400
Hitler chose war and on
the 1st of September, 1939,

208
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,040
Germany invaded Poland. The Luftwaffe, uh,

209
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,800
was at this time the most
powerful air force in the world.

210
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,240
It's commander in chief,
however,

211
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:40,840
was largely untested as a military
commander in World War One.

212
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,570
He had spent a few months in
command of a single squadron,

213
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:48,460
but that was a very different matter to
directing operations of an entire air

214
00:12:48,461 --> 00:12:50,410
force in a very modern war.

215
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:54,070
While Gehring possessed the intelligence
and ruthlessness of a great military

216
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,620
commander,
he would fail miserably in the role.

217
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,970
This was at least in part because the
corpulence Gary had too much on his plate.

218
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,190
In addition to being the
Luftwaffe as commander in chief,

219
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:07,360
he was also responsible for civilian and
military aviation policy, the Reich's,

220
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:11,590
anti aircraft defenses, industrial
and economic policy, and a good deal.

221
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:15,400
More than that. These responsibilities
were far too much for any one man,

222
00:13:15,401 --> 00:13:18,970
particularly one who was once
again sliding into drug addiction.

223
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,960
In 1937, Gehring had been prescribed
the pain killer park or Dan,

224
00:13:22,961 --> 00:13:26,050
they morphine derivative to
treat a severe too thick.

225
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,070
The tooth ache eventually went away,
but Gehring kept on taking the drugs.

226
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,090
As the war turned against Germany,
Gehring continued to up his dosage.

227
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,590
His drug use compounded his weaknesses
as a military leader is continual

228
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,050
overestimation of the
Luftwaffe as capabilities,

229
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,940
there's tendency to retreat from reality
rather than face up to bad news and a

230
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:47,260
desire to please Hitler,

231
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,190
which repeatedly led to him making
promises the Luftwaffe it could not keep

232
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,830
sometimes with catastrophic results.

233
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,090
Gehrings fading capabilities were not
immediately apparent in the attack on

234
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:59,560
Poland's, the Luftwaffe, uh,

235
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,130
made short work of the Polish air
force and it's obsolete machines.

236
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,900
In 1940 it was Frances done
and the Luftwaffe are once
again dominated the skies

237
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:11,740
as German tanks emerge from
the supposedly impossible,

238
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,520
our den forest threatening to in circle
the best of the French and British

239
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:19,180
divisions as the British prepared to
evacuate their army from the continent.

240
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:23,350
The German army had spear heads were in
position to sweep into Dunka can deal

241
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:28,030
what might have been a death blow to
the British expeditionary force going,

242
00:14:28,031 --> 00:14:31,720
however, persuaded had led
that is Luftwaffen could
finish the job on its own.

243
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:35,380
The German tanks were halted in the
Luftwaffen hit the British with everything

244
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:39,400
they had the limits of what our power
could and could not achieve had not yet

245
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:43,420
been established and nobody had ever
attempted to destroy an army from the APP.

246
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:47,590
If during kind of given the matter
sufficient thoughti might not have been so

247
00:14:47,591 --> 00:14:48,280
confident.

248
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,460
The vast artillery bombardments of world
war one were not enough to win battles

249
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:56,090
without support and the Luftwaffe couldn't
come close to matching that kind of

250
00:14:56,091 --> 00:15:00,570
hitting power gehrings most spree of
hollow and a huge armada of ships plucked

251
00:15:00,571 --> 00:15:04,670
to the British expeditionary force to
safety across the English Channel with the

252
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,640
British having fled the consonants in
the French signing an armistice on the

253
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:09,380
22nd of June,

254
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,270
1940 Hitler was bemused ins in rage to
discover the Britain had no intention of

255
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:15,170
giving up the fight.

256
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,490
He began planning an invasion but
stipulated that it couldn't go ahead until

257
00:15:19,491 --> 00:15:23,810
Britain's Royal Air Force had been
destroyed as an effective fighting force.

258
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,350
Once again, Garing was on hand
to assure Hitler that has lifted.

259
00:15:27,351 --> 00:15:29,540
Martha would make short work of the RAF.

260
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,350
He believed the Luftwaffe to
be superior in every respect,

261
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,370
but this simply wasn't the case.
The British chant,

262
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,860
roughly the same number of finances is
the Luftwaffe are in this super marine

263
00:15:39,861 --> 00:15:44,450
spitfire is every bit as good as the gem
and anyone I nines person also had the

264
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:48,030
advantage of radar and just
sophisticated ground control system.

265
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:51,620
And thanks to gehrings and ability to
get the most out of the German economy.

266
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,180
British factories were producing more
fighter aircraft per month than the entire

267
00:15:56,181 --> 00:16:00,140
Reich. Gehring also believed himself to
be on the brink of victory throughout the

268
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,500
battle of Britain best. He never
came as close to the sea imagined.

269
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,790
Gehrings third big mistake.
If the ball runs,

270
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:10,550
almost certainly his most calamitous
came in the wake of Hitler's ill judged

271
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,170
invasion of the Soviet Union.

272
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,020
When the sick Thalami became
in circles at Stalingrad.

273
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:19,190
It's the only hope was to attempt an
immediate breakout hit the hated of the

274
00:16:19,191 --> 00:16:23,820
idea of retreat under any circumstances.
So when Gehring claims the traps on me,

275
00:16:23,821 --> 00:16:27,590
you could be supplied from the, uh,
the Fiera seized upon the suggestion.

276
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,830
The idea was total nonsense.
Scaring staff knew it,

277
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:34,160
and I Geiringer really should
have known it to their results.

278
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:37,670
Who was the complete destruction of the
sick Thalami and starting grads became

279
00:16:37,671 --> 00:16:41,310
the turning points of Welsh water here.
So at this point,

280
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:44,840
and Hitler no longer trusted Gehring
and the Luftwaffe achieves reputation.

281
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:49,510
It plunged new lows as the allied
bombing campaign systematically destroyed

282
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,360
German cities.

283
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,860
Garrin now to be as best to stay out of
Hitler's way rather than a tends to as

284
00:16:54,861 --> 00:16:57,860
many responsibilities.
He spent the bulk of his time hunting.

285
00:16:57,861 --> 00:16:59,720
There's Karen whole plundering Europe,

286
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:04,220
the avast you add to his enormous
collection and consuming ever greater

287
00:17:04,221 --> 00:17:05,540
quantities of drugs.

288
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,940
On April the 30th 1945 Hitler committed
suicide with the right collapsing all

289
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:21,520
around him. Gehring knew that the war
was lost. Unlike most other top Nazis,

290
00:17:21,521 --> 00:17:23,970
he either killed themselves
or attempted to flee.

291
00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:28,020
Gehring seem to be under the bizarre
impression that he hadn't done much wrong

292
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:30,060
and therefore have less.
It was a fear.

293
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,350
On May the ninth he surrendered himself
to the Americans along with 20,000

294
00:17:34,351 --> 00:17:37,590
painkillers and one of the
world's largest art collections.

295
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:40,080
Most of it looted from all across Europe.

296
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,980
Gehring had expected an audience
with Eisenhower. Instead,

297
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:47,460
he was accused of crimes against
humanity and waging wars of aggression.

298
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,870
His guilt or innocence,
these charges would be decided at trial.

299
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,740
While the prosecution propent that case,

300
00:17:53,741 --> 00:17:57,600
scarring was weaned off his drug
addiction and placed on a strict diet.

301
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:01,830
The results was that the much diminished
Gehring who has blended his way through

302
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:06,831
the wall was now restored to the cunning
manipulative force of old of the 21

303
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:10,840
leading Nazis on trial at Nuremberg.
Garing was the most senior.

304
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,230
He didn't expect to
escape the death penalty,

305
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:16,350
but he did intend to go down fighting.
In one of the exchange,

306
00:18:16,351 --> 00:18:18,190
he rang so many rings
around the prosecutor,

307
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,050
this the American threw down his
headphones and refuse to continue with the

308
00:18:22,051 --> 00:18:22,980
cross examination.

309
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Gehrings argument was that he hadn't
wanted war and did work to avoid it when

310
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,880
forced to fight through
circumstances outside of his control,

311
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:33,120
he had done so with the principles
of a noble to tonic night.

312
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:35,970
It was not in his nature to harm women,
our children,

313
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,380
and he had no nothing of the Holocaust.
Given his powers of self delusion,

314
00:18:40,381 --> 00:18:42,750
he may well have convinced
himself that this was true.

315
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Whatever the case he was enjoying being
center stage again at least until he was

316
00:18:48,031 --> 00:18:52,470
presented with evidence that shattered
this image of himself as a noble warrior.

317
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:56,460
The idea that Gehring could have no,
nothing of the Holocaust was absurd,

318
00:18:56,461 --> 00:19:00,630
but there was this little documentary
evidence linking directly to it. However,

319
00:19:00,631 --> 00:19:04,110
there were plenty of documents indicating
that he had participated in the

320
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:08,220
persecution of Jews and personality
profited from it. Not only that,

321
00:19:08,221 --> 00:19:13,060
but tens of thousands of slave laborers
had toiled and died in the Luftwaffe as

322
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:17,400
factories and under Gary's leadership and
look to ofa had conducted horrific and

323
00:19:17,401 --> 00:19:20,130
often lethal experiments on Jews,
Gypsies,

324
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:23,070
and prisoners of war and funds
in Europe for works of art,

325
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:26,580
ordered prisoners to be shortened,
had allied m and lynched.

326
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:31,140
The judge found gathering guilty on
all charges and pass down a sentence of

327
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:34,360
death by hanging Gehring objected.
He was a soldier.

328
00:19:34,361 --> 00:19:38,520
Rents as soon as she should be executed
by firing squad rather than hanged like

329
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:40,800
a common criminal.
When his demand was refused,

330
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,990
Gehring took matters into his own hands.

331
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,050
On October the 15th he bit
down on a cyanide capsule.

332
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,190
Quite our Gehring obtains this cyanide
capsule is still not known for sure.

333
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,930
His suicide note explained that he felt
no obligation to submit to his enemies

334
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:56,730
justice while awaiting trial.

335
00:19:56,731 --> 00:20:00,900
He had told psychologists that within 50
years there would be a statue of him in

336
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,040
every German in town.

337
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,120
Gehrings opinion of himself had
not been dented at all by defeat,

338
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:10,710
but his judgements of his place in
history, certainly well wide of the mark,

339
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,450
his exploits as a brave fighter, pilots
have been utterly eclipsed by his crimes.

340
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Few men have a trashed their reputation
quite so comprehensively as Herman

341
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,210
Gehring. So I really hope you found
