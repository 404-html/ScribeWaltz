1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,710
Stanley spent most of
his career as the writer,

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,321
director,

3
00:00:03,321 --> 00:00:06,110
editor and producer of marvel comics.

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:09,350
He created some of the world's most
popular comic book characters like

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,040
Spiderman,

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,790
iron man,

7
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:11,600
the hulk,

8
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,950
and the rest of the Avengers.

9
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:17,210
While started out as the creative ideas
of a teenage boy evolved into one of the

10
00:00:17,211 --> 00:00:21,870
most profitable movie franchises
in all of history down biographics,

11
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,610
we're going to talk about
the legendary life of Stanley

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,080
[inaudible].

13
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,880
On December the 28th of 1922 Stanley
Martin Libor was born in New York City.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,211
His parents,

15
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,021
Jack and Celia,

16
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:49,040
where Romanian Jewish immigrants who
left for a better life in the United

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:49,130
States.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,150
His father was a tailor,

19
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:52,160
but he was laid off during
the Great Depression,

20
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:54,710
so they were constantly
struggling to make rent.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,970
His parents could only afford
a one bedroom apartment
and they did their best to

22
00:00:58,971 --> 00:00:59,870
provide for their son.

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,440
His mother and father slept on the couch
and allowed him to have a real bet.

24
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,220
Most of the memories Stanley had of his
father was seeing him sitting at the

25
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:07,970
kitchen table,

26
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:11,630
flipping through the want ads in the
newspaper trying to find a new job.

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:15,020
These were usually gigs
that never lasted very long.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,460
Eventually his father would find steady
work and their lives would improve at

29
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:20,294
least a little.

30
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,290
When he was nine years old,

31
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:23,150
his mother gave birth
to his younger brother,

32
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:23,810
Larry,

33
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,250
I'm saying.

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:24,620
Yeah,

35
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,000
he got a bicycle for Christmas.

36
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,110
Stan took this opportunity to ride his
bike all over New York City and hardly

37
00:01:30,111 --> 00:01:33,800
spent any time at home getting
to know his younger brother sins.

38
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:36,290
His parents were struggling
so much with money.

39
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,310
They encourage stand to get good grades
so that he would have a brighter future

40
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:43,820
than they did and they encouraged him
to find part time jobs as soon as he

41
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:44,300
could.

42
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,540
It took this very seriously and even
skipped a few grades so that he could

43
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,080
graduate from high school sooner.

44
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,490
He attended an all boys school and since
he was so much smaller and younger than

45
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:54,740
his cost made see
struggle to make friends.

46
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,700
It was often daydreaming
about his favorite movies
and often had his nose in a

47
00:01:58,701 --> 00:01:59,180
book.

48
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,590
As soon as he was old enough to work,

49
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,870
he got his first job at a garment factory.

50
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,410
The year later he moved on to become
an usher at a movie theater called the

51
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,244
Rivoli.

52
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,670
He loved this job because he was allowed
to see as many movies as he wanted for

53
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,060
free.

54
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,200
It was also able to make
money doing something that
he enjoyed and it also helps

55
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,690
him to relieve as
parents financial stress.

56
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,160
He begins to pay for his own expenses so
that his parents could focus mostly on

57
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:23,060
his brother Larry,

58
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,710
even at a young age,

59
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:28,790
his parents and teachers could tell that
he would grow up to be someone special

60
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,450
at this stage in his life stat.

61
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:34,800
Imagine that he would be more involved
in the movie business is either an actor

62
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,200
or maybe a screen right at his favorite
movie growing up was the 1935 film

63
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:40,160
captain blood,

64
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,860
which was about swashbuckling
pirate adventures.

65
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,600
He loved the elaborate fight scenes and
would often imagine becoming the hero of

66
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:49,430
these films at 15 years old.

67
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,850
Stan ends at a writing contest
for the New York Herald Tribune.

68
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:56,600
He wasn't and the editor reached out to
him to say that he should pursue writing

69
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,100
as a full time career.

70
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,130
Seeing as he had high school early,

71
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,040
he was able to get a job writing
a bitters for a newspaper.

72
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,270
That's after a while he felt that this
was pretty boring and indeed quite

73
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:07,750
morbid,

74
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,020
so he tried to see what
other opportunities were out
there for young writers was

75
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:12,930
16 years olds.

76
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,030
He got a job at timely
comics assisting that artist,

77
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,980
Jack Kennedy ends the head writer,

78
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,240
an editor or Simon,

79
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,530
the overarching publishing
company actually made most
of their income from pulp

80
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:26,350
fiction and comics were more
of an afterthought for them.

81
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,131
In the beginning,

82
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:31,540
Stan was pretty much hod just to make
coffee and erase the pencil marks on Jack

83
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,270
Kirby's drawings as well as
do various other errands.

84
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,690
Hasn't gone was any $8 a week
and if we consider inflation,

85
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,760
that's about $141 today.

86
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:44,290
So back then timely comics followed the
trends of whatever was popular at the

87
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:44,770
time.

88
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,890
Now DC comics within main
competitor and they had superman,

89
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:49,630
so the characters they created,

90
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:52,690
we'll often they recycled
idea in one way or another.

91
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,621
At this point in time,

92
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:57,640
Jackie Kirby and Joe Simon has already
been inventing superheroes like the human

93
00:03:57,641 --> 00:03:59,290
torch and Captain America.

94
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,410
Stan was eager to move on
from just making coffee,

95
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,790
so he pitched a story for a captain
America scripts off to the third issue was

96
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,420
published.

97
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,600
They liked his ideas and they agreed
to use it in the following issue.

98
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,230
This is when he decided that
his pen name would be Stan Lee,

99
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:16,320
which is just as first named Stanley's,

100
00:04:16,321 --> 00:04:17,154
but at half.

101
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,800
He figured that someday he could move
on to become a novelist under his real

102
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:24,310
name standing the Martin Neba
when he was 18 years old,

103
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:24,851
Stanley,

104
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:28,600
you had been working at timely comics
for two years and he was assisting Jack

105
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,110
Kirby and Joe Simon with all the
various duties of that company.

106
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:36,430
Both Kirby Simon were having a financial
dispute with marvel comics as publisher

107
00:04:36,431 --> 00:04:37,330
Martin Goodman,

108
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,710
and they decided to quit.

109
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,830
Stan was the only one
left and his lost Austin.

110
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,590
If he would be willing to step
into the role of head writer,

111
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,540
editor and Art Director.

112
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,460
This was meant to be a temporary fix.

113
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:48,760
Well,

114
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,070
Goodman searched for an
experienced replacements,

115
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,030
but it's stat and actually ended up
being great at doing all of these jobs at

116
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:55,660
once.

117
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,231
At the time,

118
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,590
he mainly focused on producing the
captain American comics because you know,

119
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:03,070
the 70 24 hours in a day and he
already had his work cut out for him.

120
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,120
At that time,

121
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,110
the comic book industry,

122
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,480
it was absolutely booming because people,

123
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:11,980
they wanted to escape the fears that
they had about the war by reading stories

124
00:05:11,981 --> 00:05:16,270
of heroes both in the newspapers and
in fiction World War Two at this point,

125
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:17,590
it was absolutely raging.

126
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,090
Jack Kirby and Joe Simon.

127
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:23,080
They'd already established a theme of
Captain America coming face to face

128
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,060
without Offit and on
more than one occasion.

129
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:30,061
So Stanley carried on the legacy by acting
out his fantasies of being in combat

130
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,510
overseas,

131
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,510
Captain America comics and spired
Stanley to become a real hero himself.

132
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,080
He stays is I myself,

133
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,700
got so caught up in all of that.

134
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,070
Next thing I knew I had
enlisted in the army.

135
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,120
I fell it's all nation,

136
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,410
was really in danger and so I couldn't
live with myself if I were a civilian and

137
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,300
other people wherever that fighting.

138
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,140
However,

139
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,510
Stanley was not expected
to go overseas and fight.

140
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,040
The army recruiter looked over his resume
and gave him the job of playwright.

141
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,950
He was told to stay in the United States
and write scripts for training films

142
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:04,850
and public service announcements that
were shown to soldiers even if this was

143
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,920
not exactly the fight
that Stan was looking for.

144
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,340
This was actually a pretty big deal and
all of the army play went on to have

145
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:12,710
successful careers
including Theodore Geisel,

146
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,410
who is better known as Dr Seuss.

147
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,270
So when he was 23 years old,

148
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:21,470
Stanley was discharged from the army
and he moved back to New York City to

149
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,120
return to his job where the name had
been changed from timely comics to marvel

150
00:06:26,121 --> 00:06:26,954
comics

151
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,850
when's only returned to New York City.

152
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:37,890
He began to go out on dates and
attend a lot of parties and do.

153
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,090
He was actually pretty embarrassed to
tell people that he worked for marvel.

154
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,660
A lot of women would actually just walk
away in mid conversation as soon as they

155
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,160
heard him say comic books.

156
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,830
Clearly these girls were not
the one for him all his life.

157
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:52,370
Stan would be doodling pictures of the
perfect girl that he always imagined that

158
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:56,510
he would find some day and it was like
you could see a vision of the future.

159
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,620
One night he showed up to a party when
a young woman named June Clayton on,

160
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,730
so the door stand was shocked because
this was the exact same girl he had been

161
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,890
dreaming about his entire life.

162
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,933
He blurted out,

163
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,780
hello,

164
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,070
I think I'm going to
fall in love with you.

165
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,270
Joan laughed and she thought this and the
fact that he wrote comics was actually

166
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:15,104
quite charming.

167
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,200
The only issue was that she
was married to someone else.

168
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,460
She was originally from England and she
had become a war bride and moved to the

169
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:26,240
United States with a new husband to
pursue a modeling and acting Korea.

170
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,590
She ended up fast husbands.

171
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,110
They were no longer happy
together and once she met Stan,

172
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,170
she knew that it was time to
make her divorce official.

173
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:37,430
When Stanley was 25 the do you got married
and instead of having a fancy wedding

174
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:38,150
or a honeymoon,

175
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,750
they use that money to move to long
island where they lived in a penthouse

176
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:42,584
apartment.

177
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,210
When Joan first got pregnant,

178
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:48,620
she painted that entire house pink
because she wanted a daughter so badly.

179
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:52,790
This early works and she gave birth to
a baby girl named June Juni out who they

180
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:54,020
nicknamed JC.

181
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
A couple of years later,

182
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,900
they had a second daughter named Jen.

183
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,710
Sadly,

184
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,560
Jen died after only being
alive for seven days.

185
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,070
This was such a traumatic experience
for Joan that she didn't want to have

186
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:04,904
children again.

187
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,350
They tried to a dark twist.

188
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,790
They run into a lot of issues.

189
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:10,520
Since Dan was Jewish and
Joan was episcopalian,

190
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:14,060
nearly every adoption agency rejected
them because of the differences in

191
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:14,960
religious beliefs.

192
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,130
While all of this was very tragic and
difficult for Stanley and his wife opened

193
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:23,360
up his eyes to so many issues in the
country that he had been unaware of until

194
00:08:23,361 --> 00:08:24,140
this point.

195
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:24,501
Indeed,

196
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:28,580
it would become a catalyst for his
motivation to inspire other people

197
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,590
[inaudible]

198
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:35,551
as work.

199
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:39,020
Stanley was still incredibly dedicated
with his time at marvel comics.

200
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,130
They called their staff the
bullpen because they were
pumping out a one complete

201
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,840
comic every working day.

202
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,920
He made sure to give everyone on the team
credits with the names on the cover of

203
00:08:48,921 --> 00:08:49,671
each comic book,

204
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:51,200
which was brand new for the time.

205
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,220
He also gave the group the nickname of
the Marion marvel and marching society

206
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,080
after he established more of a
leadership role in the company's down.

207
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:02,160
Eventually convinced artists Jack Kennedy
to returns a marvel comics since he

208
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:04,290
was one of the most talented
men in the business.

209
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,891
Cubbies.

210
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:09,300
Artwork brought Stanley's ideas to
life in a way that no one else could,

211
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,360
even though he was not an
accident in the traditional sense,

212
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:16,290
Stan was known for acting out the
roles of the characters when working as

213
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,170
Marvel's editor,

214
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,640
Erin's awesome director in order to
explain what he was looking for in the

215
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,270
storyline,

216
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,720
rather than giving an office stay
fully written script to follow,

217
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,750
Stanley would give them a general story,

218
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:29,280
nine of what was going to happen and
so he wanted everything to be overly

219
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:31,770
dramatic like people in a silent film.

220
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,180
Once the artwork was done,

221
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:36,780
Stan would go back and fill in the
bubbles with the appropriate dialogue.

222
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,430
This cut down on time.

223
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:39,570
Significant man.

224
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:40,320
It was cool.

225
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,300
The marvel method in the
1950s they psychologist named
Frederick what and claims

226
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:48,720
that comic books and television were
corrupting the youth in America.

227
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,010
In 1954 the Senate subcommittee on
juvenile delinquency announced the comic

228
00:09:53,011 --> 00:09:54,630
books were actually dangerous.

229
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,730
They started the comics code authority,

230
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,790
which puts strict rules of
censorship on what types of contents,

231
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,950
where to be allowed to be
published in comic books.

232
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,300
Every new story line had to be approved
by the comics code or authority as the

233
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:09,570
cover of the book would have the seal
showing that it had been checked for any

234
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:10,590
indecent contents.

235
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,670
According to the rules,

236
00:10:11,671 --> 00:10:13,050
the mention of any crime at all,

237
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:16,290
it was enough to have a comic
rejected this censorship.

238
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,640
It was a devastating blow to marvel who
made their bread and butter on superhero

239
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:22,650
stories about fighting crime.

240
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,970
Stanley had to lay off almost all of
the artists and they had to discontinue

241
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,380
many of that comics.

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,440
He was forced to write new stories that
were aimed at young children and they

243
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:36,120
were incredibly bland and boring
compared to writing about sue Harris.

244
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,310
Stanley trudged through this job for
over a decade after working in the Comic

245
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,421
Book Industry for 20 Years.

246
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:44,970
Stanley was having a
bit of a midlife crisis.

247
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,420
He had been writing these
Sydney children's from
experts so long that he really

248
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:51,450
wasn't sure he wanted to stay in the
industry and DDT was already writing

249
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,870
screenplays and newspaper articles on
the side and he was considering leaving

250
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,180
the comic book industry
in order to write a novel.

251
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:01,470
The only problem was that he still
had a wife and child to support and he

252
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:03,210
couldn't walk away from a paycheck.

253
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,860
He had a conversation with his wife,

254
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,281
Joan,

255
00:11:05,281 --> 00:11:09,390
and she encouraged him to take a chance
and try to write a comic for adults.

256
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,490
Even if it went against
the censorship rules,

257
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,080
they decided that if it's published,

258
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:13,914
a hated it.

259
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,830
The worst thing that could happen
was that he would be fired,

260
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,580
but well,

261
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,840
he was ready to quit anyways,

262
00:11:18,841 --> 00:11:20,940
so really have nothing left to lose.

263
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,940
This is when he decided to
create the fantastic four.

264
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,050
These characters,

265
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,220
they're multidimensional.

266
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,650
They didn't always enjoy
having their superpowers.

267
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,280
They don't with very real issues with
one another as well as they are in a

268
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:32,960
turmoil,

269
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,430
but that time superheros
from both companies,

270
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:39,570
they were really one dimensional
characters like captain
America or or Superman.

271
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,500
It turns out that the audience responded
really well to the fantastic four and

272
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,200
this ended up becoming
extremely successful.

273
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,360
Lovell's published a
couldn't deny the number,

274
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:52,940
so they continue to make more issues
despite the disapproval and lack of stamp

275
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:54,910
from the Comics Code Authority.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,570
Once he was able to express his ideas
within the pages of marvel comics,

277
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,540
Stan Lee discovered a
new love of the industry.

278
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,390
He began to create more
characters like a man who he,

279
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,980
based on himself as a teenager,

280
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,030
each one of these characters was a
direct reaction to the world around them.

281
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,661
For example,

282
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:14,050
the hope was written during the Cold
War when people were afraid of nuclear

283
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:14,640
science.

284
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,550
Iron man was a response to the hates for
the military industrial complex and the

285
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:21,880
x men where a social
commentary on tolerance for
people who are different from

286
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:22,570
us.

287
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,570
In 1966 Stanley created black panther who
was the world's first black superhero.

288
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,680
He was revolutionizing to the industry
and just about every single way during an

289
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:33,071
interview,

290
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:35,980
Stanley said that the
1960s and seventies well,

291
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,290
some of the best years
of his entire career,

292
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,950
and again going on tours to
universities around the United States.

293
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:42,611
By this point,

294
00:12:42,611 --> 00:12:45,610
the children who grew up in the 1950s
that we're told that comic books would

295
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,680
corrupt they're impressionable minds,

296
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:51,760
well embracing them once they reach
their teens and that 20s young people,

297
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,350
everyone looked up to Stanley.

298
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,690
He gave lectures on story writing.

299
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,680
In reality,

300
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:00,550
Stanley was gathering data around his
fans and his off to every Q and a session.

301
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,420
He was writing down notes about ways
that he could improve the marvel comic

302
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:05,254
storyline.

303
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,710
In the 1970s Stanley became
the head publisher of Marvel.

304
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,380
You decided to hand over the
responsibility of the scripts,

305
00:13:17,381 --> 00:13:19,350
do other writers on the marvel team.

306
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,090
As he tried to take the superhero
characters to California,

307
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:26,560
he convinced the executives at marvel
comics to let him move his family out to

308
00:13:26,561 --> 00:13:29,020
Los Angeles and they
opened up new offices,

309
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:31,180
gold marvel productions on the west coast.

310
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,930
It started the cartoon series of iron
man is one called spider man and his

311
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:35,830
amazing friends.

312
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,450
In 1988 he became the head of marvel
films and began to produce feature length

313
00:13:40,451 --> 00:13:41,050
movies.

314
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,810
This ended up being a great
business move because Spiderman,

315
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,280
he soon became a household name.

316
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,090
Unfortunately not everything that
marvel studios produced was a success.

317
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,340
They tried to create a show
called the amazing Spiderman,

318
00:13:51,341 --> 00:13:52,450
which add on cvs,

319
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,470
but Stanley,

320
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,490
he thought it was awful.

321
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:58,270
He scheduled a meeting with cvs and tried
to give some creative direction about

322
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,860
how to make the story better,

323
00:13:59,861 --> 00:14:02,800
but they ignored his in Burton
carried on doing it their way.

324
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,100
They should have listened to his advice
because the show was canceled after just

325
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:07,090
four episodes.

326
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,810
Hollywood studios were having a hard
time seeing the potential of these comic

327
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:14,680
book stories and didn't know how they
put them on the big screen lease dated.

328
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,510
It's hard to explain the frustration.

329
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,500
We had these characters and we knew how
they should be portrayed and there were

330
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:22,240
people who wanted to do them,

331
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,130
but nothing really jelled.

332
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:28,210
In 1997 the popularity of
comic books drops dramatically.

333
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,320
Children were still watching the marvel
animated series like x men on Saturday

334
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:32,771
mornings,

335
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,650
but the profits of the
company went really downhill.

336
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,410
While it seems almost impossible
to imagine this today,

337
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,440
marvel comics actually had
to file for bankruptcy.

338
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:41,951
Thankfully,

339
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:43,210
even though the company was broke,

340
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:46,030
they still maintained the copyright
to all of their characters,

341
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,950
which was a gold mine.

342
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,600
During this time of uncertainty,

343
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:51,410
Stanley was approached by investors.

344
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,860
You suggested that he start a whole
new company called Stanley media,

345
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,640
which specialized in creating cartoons
and comics that were streamed on the

346
00:14:58,641 --> 00:14:59,240
Internet.

347
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,020
They started in 1999 and the venture
became incredibly successful.

348
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:06,890
They were able to hire over 200
people to work on that stuff.

349
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,180
Unfortunately,

350
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:11,090
some of the executives were actually
arrested for securities fraud.

351
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,500
It turns out they had taken advantage
of Stanley's name and his reputation for

352
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:16,940
that own financial gain.

353
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,870
Stanley decided that the only way to
avoid the scandal was to start his own

354
00:15:20,871 --> 00:15:23,030
company called POW entertainment.

355
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,410
One of his most popular characters was
stripped rela voiced by Pamela Anderson.

356
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,460
Eventually level was able to get back
on their feet and they had Stanley under

357
00:15:31,461 --> 00:15:35,600
contract so that they could continue to
get as creative guidance to make sure

358
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,920
that the movies were done right.

359
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,140
After decades of dreaming
of being on the big screen,

360
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:45,080
Stanley was finally about to appear in
Hollywood blockbusters because he made

361
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:49,010
sure that his contract included cameo
roles in each new marvel movie that came

362
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,480
out for the rest of his life.

363
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,790
Reassignments was not
an option for Stanley.

364
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,920
He loved his job that much.

365
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:56,570
Stanley Martin Levy,

366
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,430
he passed away on November the 12th
2018 and it was 95 years olds and lives

367
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,720
every moment to the fullest with
a sense of joy and enthusiasm.

368
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,340
Even if the man is gone,

369
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,780
the legend of Stanley will live on forever
as being one of the most influential

370
00:16:11,781 --> 00:16:13,790
people in comic book history.

371
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,230
So I really hope you found that video.

372
00:16:15,231 --> 00:16:15,740
