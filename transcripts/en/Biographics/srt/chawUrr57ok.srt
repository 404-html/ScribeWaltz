1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
Undoubtedly one of the modern history's
most notorious and abhorrent his crimes

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,550
that the stuff of nightmares
over the course of 13 years,

3
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:12,870
he prowls for men and load them back
to his house before drugging them and

4
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:17,871
strangling them and all you took the
lives of 17 men between 1978 and 1991,

5
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:23,400
but simply killing his victims
wasn't enough for Jeffrey Dahmer.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,810
He never wanted them to leave,

7
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:26,970
so he saved several trophies,

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,530
including severed heads.

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,800
Eventually even eight parts of the
victims don't always captured in 1991 and

10
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:39,150
sentenced to 16 lifetimes here was
killed by a fellow prison inmates,

11
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,250
Christopher Scarborough in 1994.

12
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,020
And in today's video we're taking a
look at the serial killers dark life.

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,970
Jeffrey Dahmer was born on May
the 21st 1960 in Milwaukee,

14
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:07,190
Wisconsin to Lionel,

15
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,100
enjoy stanhope.

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,360
He was described by his mother was a
beautiful baby and both parents considered

17
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,280
him to be a normal child,

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,710
but as teachers they saw them differently.

19
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,700
At least one.

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,960
His first grade teacher
wondered if Jeffrey was
neglected at home and noted that

21
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,210
he was a reserved child
on his report card.

22
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:25,140
In truth,

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,160
both of Jeffrey's parents didn't spend
a lot of time with him when Jeffrey was

24
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,431
young.

25
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:32,910
His father was in college earning a
chemistry degree and Jeffrey's mother was

26
00:01:32,911 --> 00:01:33,840
often bedridden,

27
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,130
recovering from illnesses.

28
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:40,380
His parents had a tumultuous marriage
that he later described as extreme tension

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,560
from the constant arguing Italian,

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,160
yet there was no doubt Lionel and Joyce
Dahmer love their son and tried to do

31
00:01:47,161 --> 00:01:50,610
the best for him when he was six years
old where I Jeffrey might not take well

32
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:51,660
to a new baby brother.

33
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,460
They let him pick out his name.

34
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,860
Jeffrey named his younger brother David.

35
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:00,420
The Donner family moved a few times
before eventually settling in bath in Ohio

36
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,010
in 1968.

37
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,320
If there were any red flags that indicated
future violence in the young Jeffrey,

38
00:02:06,321 --> 00:02:10,320
it was this fascination with animal
bones and how they fit together.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,350
The interest in caucuses began
when he was four years old.

40
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,120
Once a Jeffrey was helping his father,

41
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,010
clear animal remains from under the house,

42
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,090
and Jeffrey was oddly thrilled by the
sound of the boons dropping into the metal

43
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
buckets he lays.

44
00:02:22,081 --> 00:02:23,160
It began collecting them,

45
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:25,980
searching in ditches and
along streets for roadkill.

46
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,930
He began dismembering the bodies behind
the house in a patch of wooded area,

47
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,320
installed the various body parts
in John's in the families woodshed.

48
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,560
On one occasion,

49
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,650
Jeffrey decapitated the corpse of a dog
before nailing the body to a tree when

50
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:40,530
he was 10 years old.

51
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,250
So over dinner,

52
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,990
Jeffrey asked his father what would happen
if chicken bones were placed in each

53
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,020
line or a chemist interpreted
his son's question,

54
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:50,070
is miss scientific curiosity?

55
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,510
And he took the opportunity to teach your
son about the proper way to clean and

56
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:55,950
to preserve his collections.

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,970
Jeffrey later admitted that the age
of 14 that he experiencing sexual

58
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,804
compulsion.

59
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,160
He designed boys,

60
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,971
not girls,

61
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,400
and these sexual fantasies
involved submission,

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,170
violence and death.

63
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,700
He began drinking as a
teenager to suppress his urges
and didn't talk to anyone

64
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:14,890
about the disturbing
thoughts that he was having.

65
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:16,120
At the age of 16,

66
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,100
he fantasized about raping a jogger.

67
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:21,310
He saw regularly and plans
to attack the man one day,

68
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,700
Jeffrey Land Way to the baseball bats
and the bushes along the man's regular

69
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:25,270
route.

70
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,380
The man didn't come by that day and
Jeffrey never attempted to carry it out

71
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:30,214
again.

72
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,360
I revere high school.

73
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,200
Most of his classmates thought of
Diana as an outcast with few friends.

74
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:37,330
Some were troubled by his heavy drinking.

75
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,230
They drunk both and beer
and liquor at school,

76
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:39,761
so I'm going,

77
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,230
it's inside the lining of his army.

78
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:42,250
Fatigue jacket,

79
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,690
his grades one average,

80
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,530
and then took a dive as his drinking
spun out of control in 1977.

81
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,890
He played clarinet briefly and
abandoned was a decent tennis player.

82
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,521
Overall,

83
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:54,730
his teachers observe Jeffrey
is a polite and quiet boy,

84
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,840
although he was awkward,

85
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,160
he regularly amused as
classmates by staging pranks
such as acting out seizures,

86
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,120
knocking over items,

87
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:03,400
and making loud and obnoxious noises.

88
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,000
The banks were so popular that similar
behavior was referred to as doing a

89
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,270
Dhamma by the end of
high school of parents,

90
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,021
troubled marriage.

91
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:13,960
She finally came to an end
after an unsuccessful attempt
at counseling in early

92
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:16,500
1978 line or moved out
of the house dominant.

93
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,430
Graduated in May of that same year.

94
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,960
A few weeks after graduation.

95
00:04:19,961 --> 00:04:23,680
Dharma committed his first murder when
he picked up a hitchhiker 18 year old

96
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,730
Steven Marks was on his way to a rock
concert when Donna Lord him back to his

97
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:30,160
house to hang out and drink
a few beers before the show.

98
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,380
My now dominant lived
alone as his parents,

99
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,130
his house,

100
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,370
his mother moved out with younger
brother David while his father took up

101
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:38,960
residence at the local
motel x and diamond.

102
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,580
Spent a few hours together listening to
music and drinking when I was ready to

103
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,270
leave dominant,

104
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,980
didn't want him to so he struck him in
the head with a 10 pound dumbbell and

105
00:04:47,981 --> 00:04:49,150
strangled him to death.

106
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,620
While Hicks was unconscious,

107
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,840
he then proceeded to
masturbate over his body,

108
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,610
moved him to the
crawlspace under the house,

109
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,660
and they selected as body before
burying it in a shallow grave.

110
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:59,860
Several weeks later,

111
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,760
Diana on Earth,

112
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:01,151
Texas,

113
00:05:01,151 --> 00:05:04,600
body the flesh from the bones
and dissolve this an asset.

114
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,860
He crushed his bones with a sledge
hammer and sprinkled them in the woodlot

115
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,760
behind the house.

116
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,691
A short time later,

117
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:13,930
diamonds father visited his son and
learns that he was living alone.

118
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,500
He moved back into the house and
convinced to Diana to enroll in college.

119
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,850
Diamond spent three months at Ohio State
University before dropping out in early

120
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:24,190
of 1979 at the urging of his father,

121
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,920
he joined the US army dominant,

122
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,880
served as a combat medic in Germany,

123
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,640
but it's performance
deteriorated due to his drinking.

124
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,760
He was honorably discharged
in March of 1981,

125
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:37,720
at least two soldiers later or tested
that diamond rapes them while in the

126
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,380
service.

127
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,590
One thing that has happened repeatedly
over the course of 17 months and the

128
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,450
other exams that diamond drugged him

129
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,290
following his discharge,

130
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,530
Donna returned home to Ohio
state only a brief time.

131
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,220
He was arrested for disorderly conduct
which prompted his father to arrange for

132
00:06:12,221 --> 00:06:12,611
dominance.

133
00:06:12,611 --> 00:06:16,630
He lived with his grandmother in Wisconsin
is alcoholism continued and he was

134
00:06:16,631 --> 00:06:18,430
arrested for indecent exposure.

135
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,840
He was arrested again in 1986 when to
boys' accused him of masturbating in front

136
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:23,380
of them.

137
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,030
In September of 1987,

138
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:28,540
Dama took his second victim
viceman with Steven to amy.

139
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,500
According to Donna,

140
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,540
he has no memory of killing to amy.

141
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:34,300
They have checked into a hotel
room together and drank heavily,

142
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:37,540
and Donald woke in the morning and
discovered the body next to him.

143
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:40,600
Dama bought a large suitcase
to transport two Emmys,

144
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,220
remains to his grandmother's basement,

145
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,820
were dismembered and
masturbated over the corpse,

146
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:48,670
so for disposing of the remains only
after dominic kills another two victims of

147
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:49,660
his grandmother's home,

148
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,270
did she tire of his late
nights in his drunkenness.

149
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,690
She had no knowledge of his
other activities and forced
them to move out of the

150
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:56,470
premises.

151
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,520
In 1988,

152
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,500
that September of 1988
Dahmer had an extremely lucky
escape and encounter with a

153
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:07,180
13 year old Laotian by resulted in
charges of sexual exploitation and second

154
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,710
degree sexual assault for diamond.

155
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,430
He pled guilty claiming that the boy
had appeared much older while awaiting

156
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,380
sentencing for the sexual assault case.

157
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,400
Dahmer again,

158
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,950
put his grandmother's
basement to a gruesome use.

159
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,240
In March of 1989,

160
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,590
he learned drugged,

161
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,280
strangled,

162
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,000
sodomized,

163
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,810
photographed,

164
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,643
dismembered,

165
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:28,210
and disposed of Antony caesars and
aspiring model at his trial for child

166
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:28,991
molestation.

167
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:29,980
In 1989,

168
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,260
Dima was the model of contrition.

169
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,040
He argued eloquently in his own defense
about how he had seen the error of his

170
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,340
ways and that his arrest marked
a turning point in his life.

171
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,680
His defense counsel argued
that he needed treatment,

172
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,850
not incarceration,

173
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,050
and the judge agreed handing down a one
year prison sentence on day release,

174
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:50,860
allowing dumber to work his job during
the day and to return to prison at night

175
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,010
as well as handing down a five
year probationary sentence.

176
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,050
Years later in an interview
with CNN line or dominant,

177
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:01,390
stated that he wrote a letter to the
court that issued that sentence requesting

178
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,940
psychological help
before his son's parole.

179
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:04,480
However,

180
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,260
Jeffrey Dahmer was granted
an early release by the
judge off to serving only 10

181
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:09,280
months of a sentence.

182
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,580
He briefly lived with his grandmother
following has released during which time

183
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:16,330
he does not appear to added to his body
counts before moving back into his own

184
00:08:16,331 --> 00:08:18,130
apartment over the following years.

185
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,360
Dom is victim counts,

186
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,141
accelerated,

187
00:08:20,141 --> 00:08:22,930
bringing his total from four to 17.

188
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,970
He developed rituals as he progressed,

189
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,070
experimented with mechanical
means of disposal,

190
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,550
and often consuming flesh of his victims.

191
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,150
Dama are also attempted crew to the bottom
is drilling into victim skulls while

192
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,460
they were still alive and injecting
them with Muriatic assets.

193
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,920
He was careful to select victims on
the fringes of society who were often

194
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,720
itinerants or borderline criminal,

195
00:08:43,721 --> 00:08:47,470
making their disappearances
less noticeable and reducing
the likelihood of his

196
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:49,380
capture as the murders piled up.

197
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,160
Adama was still unsatisfied.

198
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,120
He stated later I was completely
swept along with my own compulsion.

199
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,670
I don't know how else to put it.

200
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,350
It didn't satisfy me completely,

201
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:02,280
so maybe I was thinking maybe another
one will maybe this one will and the

202
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:05,850
numbers started growing and growing
and just got out of control.

203
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,370
As you can see on May the 27th,

204
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:08,791
19,

205
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:09,331
91.

206
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,051
Dom Is Neda.

207
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,590
Sandra Smith called the police to report
that an Asian boy was running naked in

208
00:09:13,591 --> 00:09:15,210
the streets when the police arrived,

209
00:09:15,211 --> 00:09:18,150
the boy was incoherence and
they accepted the word of dimer,

210
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:22,500
a wise man living in a
largely poor African American
community that the boy was

211
00:09:22,501 --> 00:09:23,760
his 19 year old lover.

212
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:24,271
In fact,

213
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:28,590
the boy was 14 years old and he was the
brother of the 14 year old teen that

214
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:32,730
Donna had previously molested the police
escorted dahmer and the boy home and

215
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:33,151
cleaning,

216
00:09:33,151 --> 00:09:36,630
not wishing to become embroiled in
a homosexual domestic disturbance,

217
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,210
took only accustomed to
look around before leaving.

218
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,760
Once the police left the scene,

219
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:45,090
Donna killed the boy and proceeded with
his usual rituals are they conducted

220
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
even a basic search,

221
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,690
police officers would've
found the body of dominance.

222
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:53,691
Twelfth Victim Tony Hughes before he was
finally arrested on July the 22nd 1991,

223
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,380
he killed for more manual.

224
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,201
Dom is cunning.

225
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:11,840
Spree ended when he was arrested on July
the 22nd 1991 that day to Milwaukee.

226
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,740
Police officers picked up Tracy Edwards,

227
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,480
a 32 year old African American man
who was wandering the streets with a

228
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,190
headscarf dangling from his wrist.

229
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,180
They decided to investigate the man's
claims that we dude had drugged and

230
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:24,014
restrained him.

231
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:27,200
They arrived at domus apartments where
he commonly offered to get the keys for

232
00:10:27,201 --> 00:10:28,034
the handcuffs.

233
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,090
Edwards claimed the knife dahmer had
threatened him with was in the bedroom,

234
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,400
and the officer went in
to corroborate the story.

235
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,790
He noticed a polaroid photographs
of dismembered bodies lying around.

236
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,850
It was at that point that Donna
was subdued by the officers.

237
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,730
Subsequent searches revealed
a heads in the refrigerator,

238
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,740
three more in the freezer and the catalog
of other horrors including preserved

239
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,380
skulls.

240
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,540
John's containing jenise Eylea and an
extensive gallery of macabre polaroid

241
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,050
photographs if its victims.

242
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:59,030
Dom is refrigerator and
polaroid photographs became
inextricably associated with

243
00:10:59,031 --> 00:11:00,440
his notorious killing spree.

244
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,900
In 1996 following dominance death,

245
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,970
a group of Milwaukee businessman raised
more than $400,000 to purchase the items

246
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:09,320
that he used for his victims,

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,490
including blades,

248
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:11,120
source,

249
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,751
handcuffs,

250
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,790
and a refrigerator to
store the body parts.

251
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,390
They promptly destroyed them in an effort
to distance the city from the horrors

252
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:17,691
of dom,

253
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:18,524
his actions,

254
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:21,650
and the ensuing media circus
that surrounded his trial.

255
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,900
Jeffrey dom is trial
began in January of 1992,

256
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,200
given that the majority of dominance
victims were African American.

257
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,850
There were considerable racial tensions
and say strict security precautions were

258
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:43,360
taken,

259
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,810
including an eight foot
barrier of bulletproof glass
that separated him from the

260
00:11:46,811 --> 00:11:47,410
gallery.

261
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,790
The inclusion of only one African American
on the jury provoked further unrest,

262
00:11:51,791 --> 00:11:53,340
but was ultimately contains.

263
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,520
It's very short lived well.

264
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,930
I know Donna and to second wife attended
the trial throughout dahmer initially

265
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:02,670
pled not guilty to all charges despite
having confessed to the killings during

266
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,730
police interrogation,

267
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,330
but he eventually changed his plea
to guilty by virtue of insanity.

268
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,910
His defense then offered the gruesome
details of his behavior as proof that only

269
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:15,730
someone truly insane which
commit assumption terrible acts.

270
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,530
Donna later said in an interview,

271
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,460
it's hard for me to believe that a human
being could have done what I've done,

272
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,410
but I know that I did it.

273
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:26,560
The jury chose to believe
the prosecutions of sessions,

274
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:30,670
that dom was fully aware that his acts
were evil and that he chose to commit

275
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:31,300
them anyway.

276
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,340
On February the 15th,

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,651
19,

278
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,280
92,

279
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,480
they returned after approximately 10
hours deliberation to find him guilty but

280
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:39,190
sane on all accounts.

281
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,590
He was sentenced to 15 consecutive
lifetimes in prison with 16th,

282
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,920
10 tacked on in May.

283
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,000
It is now over.

284
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,640
This has never been the
case of trying to get free.

285
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,230
I didn't ever want freedom,

286
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,170
but this was a case to tell the
world that I did what I did,

287
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,150
but not for reasons of hate.

288
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,320
I hated no one.

289
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,020
I knew I was sick or evil or both.

290
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,910
Now I believe I was sick.

291
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,450
The doctors have told me about my
sickness and now I have some peace.

292
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,190
I know how much high of cost.

293
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:06,940
Thank God.

294
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,040
There will be no more harm that I can do.

295
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,970
I believe that I the Lord Jesus
Christ can save me from my sins.

296
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,460
I ask for no consideration.

297
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,860
Dominant reportedly adjusted
well to prison life,

298
00:13:17,861 --> 00:13:20,380
although he was initially kept
apart from the general population.

299
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,710
He eventually convinced the authorities
to allow him to integrate more fully

300
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,700
with the other inmates.

301
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:28,750
He found religion in the form of books
and photos sent to him by his father and

302
00:13:28,751 --> 00:13:32,470
he was granted permission by the
Columbia Correctional Institution to be

303
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:34,120
baptized by a local pastor

304
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,340
on November the 28th,

305
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:45,671
19,

306
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:48,640
94 in accordance with this
inclusion in regular work details.

307
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,150
Donna was assigned to work with
two other convicted murderers,

308
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,290
Jesse Anderson and Christopher Askava
after they had been left alone to complete

309
00:13:56,291 --> 00:14:00,190
that task sconce or tend to find the
discover had brutally beaten both men with

310
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,810
a metal bar from the prison white room.

311
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,280
Donald was pronounced debt
after approximately an hour
and just succumbed to his

312
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:08,860
