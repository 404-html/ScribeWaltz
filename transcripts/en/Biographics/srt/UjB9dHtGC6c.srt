00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,550
Ferdinand's Magellan was one of the
leading explorers of the age of discovery,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,730
often being cited as the first
man to circumnavigate the globe.

10
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:37,230
He actually fell just short of that
milestone being hacked to death by the

11
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:41,190
natives on the Mariana's islands.
Yet his vision and tenacity,

12
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:42,840
despite tremendous odds,

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,230
opens up the westward route
to Asia and established.

14
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:49,980
His legacy is one of history's great
adventurers. In today's biographics,

15
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:54,510
we uncover the life and the tragic
death of Ferdinand Magellan.

16
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:04,000
Fascinans Magellan was born around
1480 in the north of Portugal.

17
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,220
His family were part
Portuguese aristocracy.

18
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,660
His father read Omega Hayes was an
official in the city of [inaudible] wild,

19
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,770
the family of his mother
ILDs in a mosquito.

20
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,140
We're well connected to
the Portuguese royal court.

21
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,160
Both parents though they died when
Ferdinand was about 10 years of age and he

22
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,390
was taken into the royal
court is a page boy.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,200
Ferdinand's was a page to
Queen Leonor wife of King John.

24
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:28,201
The seconds who reigns from 1481 to
1495 he was then 60 to buy his brother,

25
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,630
King Manuel the first at the
beginning of the 16th century.

26
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:33,250
Just as far as an end was coming of age.

27
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:36,040
Portugal was the most nautically
advanced country in Europe.

28
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,510
She had the best build ships and the most
experienced sailors on the high seas.

29
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,020
These advances and allowed the Portuguese
to take the lead and exploring the

30
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,670
African west coast.
However,

31
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:49,150
the Italian states had already established
land based trade routes to the East

32
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,790
shutting Portugal out of
this lucrative markets.

33
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,570
Portuguese businessmen and explorers
sought ways to develop their own route to

34
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:58,780
the forest that would bypass the
established land based route.

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:02,350
And so the rush was on to find eight
Seabourn route to the eastern markets.

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,060
Portuguese explorer Vasco together made
a huge breakthrough when he sailed down

37
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:11,710
the African coast and around the Cape of
Good Hope and then to the southern tip

38
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:13,750
of India.
Over the ensuing decade,

39
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:17,050
the Portuguese established trade
relations with the Indian kingdoms.

40
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,500
You're in Ferdinand's formative years
exploration and trade opportunities.

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,890
They were constant topics of interest
among the Portuguese and ability.

42
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,640
The crown was fully invested in this
and they were prepared to finance

43
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:28,690
explorations

44
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,670
around 1505 Ferdinand's now in his mid
twenties in listed as a member of a 22

45
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:44,560
ship escort for Francisco Down Meda,
the first viceroy of Portuguese India.

46
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,190
It is also probable that he traveled
to such places like Malaysia and the

47
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,630
African territory of Mozambique.

48
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,200
In the midst of this flourishing
and to cultural trait,

49
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,620
he would have been exposed to a dizzying
array of cultures, languages, foods,

50
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,310
and trade goods.
Magellan.

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,330
He remained in employ of the
Portuguese navy for eight years.

52
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,220
He was involved in a number of battles.

53
00:03:03,221 --> 00:03:07,310
The first being the battle of
Canon or in 1506 in this encounter,

54
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,230
the Portuguese fleets of less than 10
shifts to feed it in excess of more than

55
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,970
200 much smaller Indian vessels.
Magellan,

56
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,340
though he was wounded in
this encounter in February,

57
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,640
1509 [inaudible] participated
in the battle of day you
against the Ottoman Turks

58
00:03:21,641 --> 00:03:25,190
and southwestern India, which was
another Portuguese victory. Yeah.

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,170
Later he was president when the Indian
city of Goa was overrun having negated

60
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:30,730
the Muslim push into Asia.

61
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:34,520
The Portuguese turned their attention
to Malaysia and the city of Malarkey.

62
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,750
This island city.

63
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:39,610
It was an international port that served
as a gateway to the lucrative spice

64
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:40,690
markets to the south.

65
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,500
The Portuguese wanted control over the
city and they sent an invasion force to

66
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:47,200
achieve that.
In 1511 Magellan,

67
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,960
he was one of the invaders
who soon conquered the island.

68
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,010
Towards the end of 1511 Magellan was
awarded for his services with an award of

69
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:57,580
Richards from an exploratory mission
to the spice islands of Indonesia.

70
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,640
He was also given them ballet
slave who he named Henri k.

71
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,280
This man was to act as a
translator on Magellan's.

72
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:08,281
Later voyage to the Indian Ocean Magellan.

73
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:16,970
He returns to Portugal in 1513 he'd spent
eight years on the seas of the indies.

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,230
He was out into to a country that was
deeply involved both militarily and

75
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,810
commercially in the African continent
conflicts where I'm going with both the

76
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:28,290
North African pirates and the
Muslims who inhabited the consonants.

77
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,910
Surely after returning to portrait goal,

78
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:33,920
Magellan joins an expedition against a
revolt in the Moroccan city of ours or

79
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:38,640
more. We're okay. I'd been a possession
of the Portuguese since 1486 as a result,

80
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,670
each of its cities were obligated
to pay an annual tribute. However,

81
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:46,671
in 1513 the ruler of Azamara man by the
name of Mou lays him on refuse to pay.

82
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,070
He then led a revolt against
the Portuguese with the
goal of pushing the invader

83
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:50,910
out of his country.

84
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,210
The king determined to put down the
rebellion with overwhelming force in order

85
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,950
to teach his subjects the lesson.

86
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,970
He sends an army of 15,000 men under the
leadership of the Duke of brick ends up

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,330
this false. It's soon quashed the
uprising within a few years. However,

88
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:06,420
the Portuguese found that the costs
involved in keeping us more in order,

89
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:10,620
well more than the revenue generated
from the city and it was abandoned during

90
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:11,880
the battle of as in more Magellan,

91
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:15,150
he was thrown from his horse receiving
a leg wound that would leave him with a

92
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:16,620
limp for the remainder of his life.

93
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,580
This was not the only all happy experience
that he had in Morocco as a prominent

94
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:24,060
member of the Victoria saw me. He was
awarded some of the spoils of victory,

95
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,900
but before long he was accused of
carrying on illegal trade with locals by

96
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,430
selling some of those spoils back to the
Moroccans that a profit, the accusation.

97
00:05:32,431 --> 00:05:36,480
It was thoroughly investigated
by Magellan's military
superiors and he was found

98
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,460
not guilty. Still the episode. It
certainly left a stain on his sofa.

99
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,750
Exemplary record.

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,410
It seems to have lost him considerable
favor with the king whose sister he had

101
00:05:46,411 --> 00:05:48,900
served as a page boy in his
youth on his returned to Lisbon.

102
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:52,290
Magellan requested an increase in his
pension on the strength of a service in

103
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,690
Morocco,
but this was denied by the king.

104
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,010
When you requested permission to
accompany several Portuguese military

105
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,290
expeditions Magellan,
he was again turned down.

106
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,440
It was pretty apparent to him that
he had lost the trust of demonic

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,460
with the king leaving him out in the cold
and Magellan now set about formulating

108
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:15,830
plans for his own voyage of expiration.

109
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,090
His intention was to find a faster route
to the spice islands by sailing west

110
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:21,230
across the Atlantic Ocean.

111
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,160
He was unaware of the size of the
Pacific Ocean or the length of the South

112
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,993
American continent sins,

113
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:29,810
so imagine that this would be quicker
and easier than sailing all the way down

114
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,510
to the southern tip of Africa
to get to the Indian Ocean.

115
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,140
Magellan took his plan to the king
requesting financing for the expedition.

116
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,440
He used the fact that the Spanish were
likely to reach the space islands before

117
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,930
women's claimed jurisdiction
over its valuable space.

118
00:06:41,931 --> 00:06:44,780
Straight as a bit of leverage,
however, it King Manuel,

119
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:48,650
he was not moved and he turned down
Magellan's request. He did, however,

120
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:51,290
give permission to seek
funding from other rulers.

121
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,310
Magellan's had his sights on the Spanish
crown is the backer for his expedition.

122
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,850
He traveled to Seville where he met
up with other Portuguese mariners and

123
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,510
navigators. Together they formed a
plan to take to the Spanish crown.

124
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,960
The expedition would be presented as
the opportunity to achieve the Westwood

125
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:10,250
route to the indies that Columbus had
failed to achieve in the 1490s there's new

126
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:10,551
routes.

127
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:13,960
It would also avoid competition with the
Portuguese who were committed to their

128
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:17,960
well established but much longer route
through the Indian Ocean as icing on the

129
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:21,440
cake. Magellan contented that's on the
basis of his cartography calculations.

130
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,650
The spice islands would be found a
lie within territory that was in the

131
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:26,540
possession of the Spanish.
The proposal,

132
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,280
it was attractive to the
Spanish King Charles,

133
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,730
the first Magellan and his cartographer
refill the Arrow when they joined

134
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,020
captains of the expedition.

135
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:36,320
They were also made knights of the
order of Santiago and given a 10 year

136
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,630
monopoly on all trade in the
area through their route,

137
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:42,230
along with 5% of all revenues
received from the root. As a bonus,

138
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,390
they would each be given a
governorship on the islands.

139
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,360
The Spanish crown puts up the money
for the purchase of ships and crew and

140
00:07:47,361 --> 00:07:51,560
supplies. This, it was a stunning
success for Magellan. Yup.

141
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,980
Despite the financing and
prospects conferred by the king,

142
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,690
he soon ran into difficulties.
Spanish sailors were incense.

143
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,120
The two Portuguese Marin has had been
placed at the head of the expedition.

144
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:05,150
When they heard of all the lucrative
benefits that the two would receive,

145
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,550
they were angry is still
members of the Spanish course.

146
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,800
I'm able to stomach the king's generosity
to these foreigners that attempt to do

147
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,110
subvert the expedition.

148
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,260
They're leasing a funds was held
up resulting in a flow on effect,

149
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:17,990
so that made it virtually impossible
for the two captains to make the

150
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:19,220
preparations.
Meanwhile,

151
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:22,760
King Manuel the first back in Portugal
heard about the Spanish financing of the

152
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:23,270
voyage.

153
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:27,380
This apparently caused him to feel regret
that he had turned down the request.

154
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,100
By Magellan.

155
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,430
He sat about trying to sabotage the
Spanish expedition as well as sending an

156
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,610
envoy to the Spanish court
for that express purpose.

157
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,390
Brahms developed two between
Magellan and Fatty Arrow.

158
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,320
In fact of the relationship between the
became so strained that finally Arrow

159
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:44,510
who has his captaincy revoked Indeed's,
he was totally kicked off the expedition.

160
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,070
More personnel problems followed.

161
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,700
The Spanish prevented Magellan
for bringing Portuguese
sailors on board despite

162
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:53,120
the fact that many of the
men that Magellan wanted
were experienced in sailing

163
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:56,100
the parts of the ocean that he was headed
to in the ends of the majority of the

164
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:56,900
group were Spanish,

165
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,150
showed that there was representation
from a number of other lands including

166
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:03,860
North Africa. Magellan's slave on
Rico also sailed with his master.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,910
Finally,
Magellan had five ships ready to sail.

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,990
These were the Tryna Dan's upon which
he sailed the Victoria, the Concepcion,

169
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,060
the Santo, Antonio, and the Santiago.
In total there were 273 men.

170
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,570
Everything we know about Magellan's voyage
comes from the journal that was kept

171
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,680
by a crew member by the name
of Antonio. Bigger, fatter.

172
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,420
They sailed out of Seville
harbor on Saint Lawrence Day,

173
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,480
August the 10th 1519
during his time in Seville,

174
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,060
Magellan had met and married a teenage
girl by the name of Beatrice Barbosa,

175
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,020
who was the daughter of a Portuguese
friends not long thereafter,

176
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:44,680
Beatrice gave birth to their first
and only child, a son named Rodrigo.

177
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:48,070
When he sailed out of Seville. This was
the last time he would ever see them.

178
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,830
The fleet sailed down the
Guadalquivir river. Finally,

179
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:53,710
on September the 20th they headed
out into the Atlantic Ocean.

180
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,110
The first stop was tenor
reef in the Canary Islands.

181
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,760
Getting there was plain sailing,

182
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,750
but the next leg of the journey from tenor
reef southwest across the equator was

183
00:10:01,751 --> 00:10:03,790
beset by wild storms.

184
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,090
The chronic color picker fatter describes
many occasions when the men thought

185
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:10,180
that they were done for us.
Terrible storm winds battered the ship.

186
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,230
He puts that deliverance down to the
divine inheritance of Saint Anselm who

187
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:17,350
showed his presence by a
light at the tip of the mast.

188
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:21,100
What he was actually saying was sent
Alamos fire and electrical charge that is

189
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:23,530
often seen on the top of
mosques and thunderstorms.

190
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,830
Having navigated the stormy seas
Magellan's set the course for Brazil,

191
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:28,660
which was a possession of the Portuguese,

192
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,140
but they have not yet established any
substantial settlements that Magellan's

193
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,530
five ships reached the Brazilian coast
in early November and then move south

194
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:38,920
until they reached the Bay of Rio de
Janeiro. Upon reaching South American,

195
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:43,030
Magellan had to face the reality of the
geography that it only previously guest

196
00:10:43,031 --> 00:10:44,760
apps.
He had assured the Spanish king this.

197
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,700
He would discover a street through this
consonants that would allow them to pass

198
00:10:48,701 --> 00:10:52,000
into the south seas and then make
a direct runs the east indies.

199
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,290
What he found was that the South American
coast ran for far longer than it ever

200
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:59,860
imagines and there was no promise that
it finds a straight to cut through it.

201
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,100
The realization that they might be forced
to add an unknown length of time to

202
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:07,000
their journey by circumnavigating South
America caused to tension among the crew

203
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,080
from Rio de Janeiro.

204
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:11,890
The fleet traveled south to the Rio de
la Plata estuary that they stopped to

205
00:11:11,891 --> 00:11:13,780
allow the men to explore in Edmond.
Yeah.

206
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:17,850
They came across a tribe
of natives described by pig
of Fetzer is cannibalistic

207
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,110
giants.
According to his journal accounts,

208
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:23,080
the crew managed to coax four of the
natives, a board, one of the ships,

209
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,590
while distracting them with
trinkets pickup at a rights.

210
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,300
The captain had the fetters put on the
feet of both of them and when they saw

211
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:32,920
the bolts across the fat as being struck
with a hammer to reverse and prevent

212
00:11:32,921 --> 00:11:35,590
them from being opens.
These giants were afraid,

213
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,800
but the captain made signs to them
that they should suspect nothing.

214
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:41,350
Nevertheless perceiving the trick.
This had been played on them.

215
00:11:41,351 --> 00:11:45,670
They began to blow and foam at the mouth
like bulls loudly calling their devil

216
00:11:45,671 --> 00:11:47,890
to help them.
Magellan put the other two in irons,

217
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:49,270
but then decided to release them.

218
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,780
The actions of the sailors appear
excessively aggressive towards the native

219
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:57,130
people. Rio De la Plata, this sled
it to devolve into outright combat.

220
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,480
Magellan lost his first man.

221
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:01,600
When a sailor was hit in the torso
by a poisoned Arrow Magellan.

222
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:05,290
He made a speedy access, but rather
than head back out to the open seas,

223
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,800
it was decided to head into the river
in the belief that it could just be the

224
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:12,160
street that would allow them to cross
the continent. It didn't take them long.

225
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,840
However,
to realize that the waters,

226
00:12:13,841 --> 00:12:17,740
they were traveling in fresh water and
so could not have come from the ocean on

227
00:12:17,741 --> 00:12:20,560
the other side of the continent.
When Magellan realized his mistake,

228
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:24,220
he turned south coming to the port of
San Julian in Argentina just prior to

229
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:28,090
Easter of 1520 he decided to
they up there over the winter.

230
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,380
The rest who would not be
without incidence I mutiny
was incited by two Spanish.

231
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:35,710
Captain would resented serving under
a Portuguese man from the stars.

232
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,950
Magellan had the loyalty of the
majority of the men and the dissenters.

233
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:42,670
They were sidelined and dismissed during
the layer over the Santiago headed off

234
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,290
on a reconnaissance mission to the south.

235
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,390
It became shipwrecked
in the Santa Cruz River.

236
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,880
The ship was lost along with
one of the crew members. Now,

237
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,040
just before we continue
with Magellan's journey,

238
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,790
let me take a moment to tell you about
Squarespace who make these longer videos

239
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:59,020
possible. Squarespace and powers, and
that's the word they use in their copy,

240
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:03,640
but I rather like it empowers dreams
and makers and do is it gives them the

241
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:07,360
tools. Do you bring that creative ideas
to life? Squarespace makes it easy to,

242

you know,

245
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,250
getting a domain for one
side and then working hours.

246
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:21,820
How's it ported over to the other websites
and then working out if you want to,

247
00:13:21,821 --> 00:13:23,330
how to sell something on the internets.

248

Squarespace make this all very
neat and tidy. It's all very nice.

Let's get back to Magellan.

264
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,340
Magellan was now down to
four ships out to pick it up.

265
00:14:24,341 --> 00:14:25,450
The crew from the Santiago,

266
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:28,430
they carried on down the South
American coast to Cape Verdean.

267
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:31,750
As there they found a straight between
the consonants or mainland's and the

268
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:34,360
islands of Tierra del Fuego.
It was the straits.

269
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:37,840
They were looking forward to take them
across the far Roshan and his would come

270
00:14:37,841 --> 00:14:39,820
to be known as the Straits of Magellan.

271
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:43,810
One ship was sent forth to see whether
the salt water would turn to fresh water

272
00:14:43,811 --> 00:14:47,380
as they progress through the straits.
It didn't and it's the entire fleet.

273
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,440
They had it inland's before long.
They came to a fork in the waters.

274
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,310
Magellan sent the Concepcion and the
Santo Antonio were along the southeast

275
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,550
channel. While his ship, the Trinidads
in the Victoria, they headed south west.

276
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,690
During this exploration,

277
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,530
many of the crew of the sound to Antonio
mutinied since the ship headed back for

278
00:15:03,531 --> 00:15:05,090
Spain,
the remaining three ships,

279
00:15:05,091 --> 00:15:08,000
they figured that the Westwood Channel
was the one to follow and so they headed

280
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,301
down,

281
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:13,280
it's on November the 30th 1529 by
December the first they had made it to the

282
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,760
South Sea witch Magenta and rechristened
the Pacific Ocean getting through the

283
00:15:16,761 --> 00:15:20,990
streets. It was an impressive
feat of maritime skill with
many treacherous areas.

284
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:21,980
Haven't been navigators,

285
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,460
Mama gentlemen was ecstatic to have
found the passage had been seeking.

286
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:29,150
He was also very aware that he was
running desperately low on supplies.

287
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,220
Stopping to forage on
the coast was an option,

288
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:34,340
but this brought with it the risk of
further conflicts with the native people.

289
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,480
As a result of the decision was made
to push on directly into the ocean.

290
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,980
Despite the lack of food,
they had no idea what they were in for.

291
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,800
It would be another 12 weeks
before land would be cited.

292
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:49,280
The food situation soon became desperate
with pig [inaudible] are recording.

293
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,480
We only eight older biscuit reduced to
powder and full of grubs and we drank

294
00:15:53,481 --> 00:15:57,260
water that had turned to yellow and
smelled when even the biscuits were gone.

295
00:15:57,261 --> 00:16:01,250
They caught and date wraps and then
they were reduced to chewing on leather

296
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,040
cloth and Sawdust scoby.

297
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:06,890
It became rampant since the death toll
began to mount among the first to die

298
00:16:06,891 --> 00:16:09,230
with the two giants who had been
captured a few months earlier,

299
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,510
at least 30 of the crew followed them.

300
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,560
Finally in January of 1521 and group
of uninhabited small islands were

301
00:16:15,561 --> 00:16:17,330
scientists finding no food there.

302
00:16:17,331 --> 00:16:20,990
They push it on until they came to the
island of Guam at the beginning of March

303
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,980
on this inhabited islands, they finally
found food and supplies from Guam,

304
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:27,470
the fleet headed southwest
of the Marianas Islands,

305
00:16:27,471 --> 00:16:29,210
which we know today as the Philippines.

306
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,840
Magellan was keen to establish friendly
relationships with the native people

307
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,060
that thanks to the age of
his translator on Rica.

308
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:38,780
He was able to establish diplomatic
relations through the giving of gifts,

309
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,510
the demonstration of arms
and tours of his ships,

310
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,200
the people of the Masala islands
on which the fees had lands.

311
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:53,960
It encouraged them to move on to what
appeared to be the Capitol Island of Subu.

312
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,960
This they did, but I'm sure if
the reception they would receive,

313
00:16:56,961 --> 00:16:59,930
Magellan ordered the artillery to
be fired as they enter the port.

314
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,790
This period unnecessary as the people,

315
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,000
they were friendly but and formed the
opinion that the chief of the island's

316
00:17:05,001 --> 00:17:08,060
Rasha whom Oban was the king
of oldest surrounding islands.

317
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,530
So in securing this friendship,

318
00:17:09,531 --> 00:17:13,310
he imagines that he now had the
allegiance of all of the other islands.

319
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,260
In this though he was mistaken.

320
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,900
Each islands operated as
an independent sovereignty.

321
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,950
Still Magellan headed for the islands
of Makaton believing this here too.

322
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:23,750
He would get a positive welcome.
However,

323
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,410
the chief of maketime not lap who refuse
to submit to the strange foreigners

324
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,570
Magellan was offended and
withdrew back to Sebu VA.

325
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,210
He prepared his men to attack
the inhabitants possibly
on the intelligence if

326
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:35,044
Rhonda,
whom I bond.

327
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,170
He was convinced that he
would not encounter a launch
force of resistance. He,

328
00:17:39,171 --> 00:17:40,820
while he was wrong,
when Magellan,

329
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,310
it is false of 60 men waited
to show her on Makaton.

330
00:17:43,311 --> 00:17:47,690
They were confronted by between one
thousand five hundred and three thousand

331
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:51,870
warriors armed with and Arrows,
the seders at the benefits of Muskets,

332
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,370
but these were cumbersome, slow to load
and unreliable hoping to cause confusion.

333
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,880
Magellan's sent some of his men to burn
the hearts of the natives. However,

334
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,720
they were intercepted and killed
Magellan's attacking forces.

335
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:05,080
They were unable to gain any grounds.

336
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,070
Being forced to fight from the
short according to pick a fatter.

337
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,590
The natives focus their
attention on Magellan,

338
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,810
the man who was the
leader of the invaders,

339
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,480
he describes the end
of his captain as such.

340
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,750
So many of them challenge down on us
that they shut the captain through the

341
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,740
right leg with a poison dairy and that's
a county ordinance to retire slowly.

342
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:26,850
But the men took the flight except six
to eight of us who remained with the

343
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:27,920
captain.
The natives,

344
00:18:27,921 --> 00:18:31,410
Sean Tony has our legs for the latter
were bad and so many where the spears and

345
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,800
stones that they held at us that
we could offer no resistance.

346
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,490
The natives continue to pursue us and
picking up the same spare four or six

347
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,030
times,

348
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:43,140
held it at us again and again recognizing
the captain and so many tons upon him

349
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:45,210
that they knocked his
helmet on his head twice,

350
00:18:45,211 --> 00:18:49,590
but he always stood firmly like a good
night and Indian held a bamboo spear into

351
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:50,341
the captains face,

352
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:53,340
but the latter immediately killed him
with a lunch which she left and the

353
00:18:53,341 --> 00:18:56,760
Indians body then drying to lay
hand on sword. He could draw it out,

354
00:18:56,790 --> 00:19:00,210
but halfway because he had been wounded
in the arm with a bamboo spirit.

355
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,760
When the native saw that they
all held themselves as upon him,

356
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,940
one of them wounded him in the left
leg with a large cutlass that calls the

357
00:19:05,941 --> 00:19:10,080
captain to full face downward when they
immediately rushed upon him with iron

358
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:14,700
and bamboo spears and with their
cutlasses until they killed off mirror our

359
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:18,470
light, our compass, and our true
guide. When they wounded him,

360
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,960
he turns back many times to see whether
we were all in the boats therap on

361
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:22,883
holding him dead.

362
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:27,570
We wounded retreated as best we could
to the boats which were already pulling

363
00:19:27,571 --> 00:19:28,321
off the ship,

364
00:19:28,321 --> 00:19:32,280
made a speedy departure to Sebago need
to find that Roger Hemovon was no longer

365
00:19:32,281 --> 00:19:36,510
friendly. He had around 30 of the sailors
poisoned during a feast. After that,

366
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,700
the surviving set sail
for the spice islands.

367
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,630
The goal of reaching those islands
when it was finally mess bus Magellan,

368
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,330
his page,
the ultimate price in its achievements,

369
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,380
more than 90% of his men had
also perished on the voyage.

370
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:53,290
The captains of the two remaining ships
disagreed about the re time. As a result,

371
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,850
they parted ways with the Trinidad
sailing back across the Pacific while the

372
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:59,640
Victoria took the Portuguese rouge
around the Cape of Good Hope.

373
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,240
As it turned out to the Trinidad was
stopped by Portuguese officials with its

374
00:20:03,241 --> 00:20:06,150
crew being arrested.
Victoria arrived back in Seville,

375
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:10,530
Spain on September the sixth 1522
the ship was and down with spices,

376
00:20:10,531 --> 00:20:13,770
but the crew were near death
from starvation and the ship,

377
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,330
but it was about to fall apart.

378
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,630
Only 18 men were on board from a total
of 237 who had set sail from that port

379
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,330
three years out of the APP.
But those 18 men,

380
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,560
while they had the distinction of being
the first to second navigate the globe.

381
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,200
