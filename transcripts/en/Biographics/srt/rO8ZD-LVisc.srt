7
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:19,050
Leonardo da Vinci was a genius
who invented revolutionary
ideas centuries before

8
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,900
the rest of the world
would catch up with him.

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,380
He embodies the definition
of a renaissance man,

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,460
one who studied and mastered a
variety of different subjects.

11
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:29,323
He was a painter,

12
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:29,991
an engineer,

13
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:30,870
or an architect or right,

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,860
or a scientist and an invents up.

15
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:37,520
While you may know him for his most famous
works like the Mona Lisa or the last

16
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:38,270
supper,

17
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,060
few people know the man
behind the paintings.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,300
Today on biographics,

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,590
we're telling you all
about the anodic Da Vinci.

20
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,960
My baby boy named Leonardo was born on
April the 15 1452 and a Tuscan village

21
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:03,830
called Vinci.

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,470
The child was born out of wedlock to
a wealthy legal notary named mess-up,

23
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:08,990
yarrow,

24
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,990
Fru Senio to Antonio and to beautiful
peasant girl named Catarina Dimio lippy.

25
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:17,450
His father took responsibility for
the boy and raised him on the family,

26
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:18,590
a stage with his wife,

27
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,060
but as a bastard child,

28
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,510
a young Leonardo was not even allowed
to be given his father's last name.

29
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,180
He was simply called the NR Two da Vinci,

30
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:31,070
which means Leonardo Da Vinci lived
with his biological mother and son.

31
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:34,970
He was five years old when his father
took over the responsibility of raising

32
00:01:34,971 --> 00:01:35,360
him.

33
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,350
Casuarina went on to marry a man who
was simply referred to as the fight up.

34
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,110
Leonardo's father Massa and married a
16 year old Nobel girl named Al Barrier

35
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:44,301
Ends.

36
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:46,370
They have legitimate
children of their own.

37
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,690
Instead of going to school,

38
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:50,360
the country signed was
young Leonardo's classroom.

39
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,620
Even as a young age,

40
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:54,890
he was inquisitive and he
truly fell in love with nature.

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,960
He wished that men could fly like the
birds and swim through the oceans like the

42
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:00,590
fish.

43
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,850
Together with his brothers,

44
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:06,851
they played games of war and he imagines
being triumphant in battle like the men

45
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,500
and the stories that
were told by his father.

46
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,101
However,

47
00:02:10,101 --> 00:02:11,120
this stage of innocence,

48
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,170
it couldn't last forever.

49
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,860
As he grew up in the NRD learns that
he would not be allowed to inherit the

50
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:16,694
family estate.

51
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,430
[inaudible] had nine
brothers and three sisters,

52
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,910
so even if he could inherit
his father's estate,

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,350
it's not like there's going
to be much to go around.

54
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,860
It's like,

55
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,250
well,

56
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,971
the Anado hands,

57
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:29,660
I learn a trade and figure out
how to take care of himself.

58
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,670
Now in medieval florins guilds,

59
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,900
they were sort of like
today's trade unions and they
were split up into multiple

60
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:38,240
categories of jobs that
a man could choose from.

61
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:41,540
So long as he was born into
the right social class,

62
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,850
the highest ranking guilds
were called the RTM.

63
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:48,020
Maggiore and his father would have
been a part of the guild for powerful

64
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:48,531
lawyers,

65
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:48,981
judges,

66
00:02:48,981 --> 00:02:49,730
and notaries,

67
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,290
but as an illegitimate child,

68
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:55,190
this was like being in the lower class
and he was not even allowed to join the

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,690
[inaudible] guild categories,

70
00:02:56,691 --> 00:03:00,520
which middle class workers like
blacksmiths stonemasons were a part of.

71
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,410
His only option was to join the guild,

72
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:05,740
which held lower cost jobs
like beggars and Miller's.

73
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,310
However,

74
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,150
they're nodoz father.

75
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,310
He still wanted his son
to have a good life.

76
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,250
Now he could see that the boy
had a natural talent for art.

77
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,900
So his father introduced him to a man
called Andre at Dell very Archie own.

78
00:03:15,901 --> 00:03:19,660
He ran an old studio in the city of
Florence off to seeing the boys sketches.

79
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:22,090
He agreed to take him on as an apprentice.

80
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,460
Okay.

81
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:32,810
Andre Delver Akio had several artists
and craftsmen working for him in his

82
00:03:32,811 --> 00:03:33,380
workshop.

83
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,100
He would take on commissions from the
wealthy and the powerful and the DC family

84
00:03:37,101 --> 00:03:40,040
and divide the work amongst
his students and employees.

85
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,550
Their studio works on improving
the beauty of the city.

86
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,560
They had to work with all mediums,

87
00:03:45,561 --> 00:03:47,600
whether it was carving marble statues,

88
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,560
Costing Matt a law,

89
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,790
painting portraits,

90
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,800
even architecture,

91
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,010
bridges and lots of other civil
engineering projects were all sketched by

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,240
members of their skilled.

93
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,230
So this made it necessary for Leonardo
to learn multiple disciplines.

94
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,730
After a few years of training,

95
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:06,731
Leonardo Da Vinci assisted Verrocchio
and painting a commissions piece for the

96
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,250
Catholic Church gold,

97
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,570
the baptism of Christ.

98
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,030
This was a very large mural
on the wall of a church,

99
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,990
so there was plenty of space for two
artists to stands and work on the painting

100
00:04:14,991 --> 00:04:15,830
at the same time.

101
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,030
Rocky Akio instructed Leonardo depends.

102
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,520
Two angels that had been included in
his rough sketch when Da Vinci was done,

103
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:24,560
Rockiyo was in total shock.

104
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:28,130
He could not believe how gorgeous and
lifeline because the painting was.

105
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,880
He knew that the students had
already surpassed the master.

106
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,020
By his mid Twenties Leonardo Da Vinci
became a master artist at [inaudible]

107
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:38,090
studio and Deon himself a reputation.

108
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,940
Then I'll do conducted a
lot of experiments with
arts like studying how like

109
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,400
change the shading on an object or the
perfect time of data sketch someone's

110
00:04:46,401 --> 00:04:47,120
face.

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
However his talents,

112
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,760
it was also a curse because it caused a
lot of jealousy among the art community.

113
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,110
At 24 years old,

114
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,950
Da Vinci was accused of having sex with
a male prostitute and he was arrested

115
00:04:57,951 --> 00:04:58,730
for sodomy.

116
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,271
At that time,

117
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:02,870
the punishment for Saul to
me was being burned to death,

118
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,010
but when he went to trial,

119
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:07,970
no evidence was presented and no witnesses
came forward and they simply could

120
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:10,220
not prove that had done anything illegal,

121
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,480
so they had to let him go.

122
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,200
However,

123
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,190
even though he was found not guilty,

124
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:17,570
still wrote in his journals that
this scandal very seriously hurt.

125
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:21,590
His reputation for Yukon's wanted to
work with them in forums despite his

126
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,490
obvious talent.

127
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,550
Now we don't know Da Vinci's
actual sexual orientation.

128
00:05:25,551 --> 00:05:27,530
We only know that he never got married.

129
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,100
Some believe that he chose to be
celebrated in order to focus on his work.

130
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,083
At the end of the day,

131
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,900
whoever turned him into the
authorities definitely wanted him dead.

132
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,310
As awful as this sounds,

133
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,180
medieval times,

134
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:42,170
they were truly cut throat and none of
high standing always had to watch their

135
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:46,250
backs to make sure they were not killed
by their enemies and assassin named

136
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,000
Bernardo demand.

137
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,900
Dino Baron and Jelly stabby on her demo
DG in the streets simply because they

138
00:05:50,901 --> 00:05:52,760
were both from rival banking families.

139
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,480
One of Leonardo's earliest known sketches
was his observation of Marin Shelley's

140
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,314
body and the,

141
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,720
and it was titled the hanged man.

142
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,930
Often with this dispute between the Baron
cellies and the [inaudible] families

143
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,950
Florence in Naples,

144
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,120
they were on the brink of war,

145
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,530
the men in Da Vinci's gills.

146
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,000
They were forced to stop working on art
and to use their engineering skills to

147
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,870
defend the city.

148
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,700
Since da Vinci was a bastard,

149
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:16,370
he could not become a knight
and serve in the role court.

150
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,060
Instead,

151
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,470
he started to design ladders and massive
weapons to help defend the Florence

152
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,550
should they ever need it.

153
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,140
Perhaps he saw this as his way to
be remembered in the history books.

154
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,940
During the three month time period,

155
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:31,880
the city was on edge believing
they were on the brink of war.

156
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,820
When Lorenzo muddy tree roots islands
off often making a successful peace

157
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,420
treaty.

158
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,150
The rest of the city
celebrated but Leonardo,

159
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,740
he was actually disappointed.

160
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,460
After peace returned to the city,

161
00:06:41,461 --> 00:06:44,420
the artist's skills could go
back to making beautiful things,

162
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:48,450
but this was no longer challenging
or interesting to Vinci.

163
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,940
When he was 29 years old,

164
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:53,900
he was asked to do his first commissioned
the mural as a church all by himself.

165
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,020
The painting was called adoration of the
Magi Ans he took his concept above and

166
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:02,000
beyond what any other
painter had done previously.

167
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,440
It was an incredible piece,

168
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:07,100
But da Vinci didn't seem to see that
because it's off to spending a very long

169
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,300
time working on the piece.

170
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:11,600
He decided that he simply
could not finish the painting.

171
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,560
He was very restless at that time and
he didn't have the patience to actually

172
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:18,170
sit and complete a lot of his projects.

173
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,640
He had so many brilliant ideas,

174
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:22,730
but he sometimes had
trouble executing on them.

175
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,290
Da Vinci was actually sued more than one,

176
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:29,720
so getting paid by a patron that then
failing to finish the work as he promised.

177
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,520
This couples with the accusation of sodomy
meant that his talents who is simply

178
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,830
not enough to make up
for his bad reputation.

179
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:41,050
You thought that now maybe it was
the time to start over some way.

180
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,830
New.

181
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,600
Now just before we get into
Da Vinci's new stage of life,

182
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,550
I do want to quickly tell
you about brilliance.

183
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,430
Now I can't promise you that they'll
turn you into the next Da Vinci,

184
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:53,000
but I can promise you that brilliant will
improve your understanding of what he

185
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,650
and the other great scientists have done.

186
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,040
Brilliant science learning platform that
allow you to learn through something

187
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,030
called active learning,

188
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:02,810
which sums up is basically the opposite
of that feeling of reading a really

189
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:07,580
complex paragraph about some principal
and then having no idea what on earth

190
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,400
they're talking about.

191
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,780
Even if you've read it a dozen
times and it's not just the basics.

192
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:12,950
That brilliant cover though,

193
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,570
they totally covered the basics as well.

194
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,810
They go all the way through to things
like complex statistics and a whole lot

195
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:19,280
house.

196
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,840
Whether you want to like Da Vinci,

197
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:24,980
look at some classical mechanics or
maybe you want to jump ahead just a few

198
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,860
years and look at special
relativity or quantum objects.

199
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,341
Brilliant.

200
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,680
Makes even the most complex concepts,

201
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:31,730
easy to understand.

202
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,620
They give you something
super short to read.

203
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,670
It's just a few lines.

204
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:38,000
It's very easy to get through and then
you immediately apply what you just

205
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,721
learned to a problem.

206
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,940
You simply rinse and
repeat that and suddenly,

207
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:43,940
or understanding a whole bunch of stuff
that you didn't think you would be.

208
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,180
I've been using brilliant and I think
you should go try it out just to see how

209
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:51,080
fascinated is for such a complex
subject to be so easily grasped.

210
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,630
You can support biographics beginnings,

211
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:56,940
a brilliant.org forward slash
biographics unless get back to Da Vinci.

212
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:06,410
Even though he was more talented than
many of the other painters in Florence,

213
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:10,340
Leonardo da Vinci still went through a
midlife crisis when he was 30 years old.

214
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,280
He realized that the lifestyle
of a professional artist,

215
00:09:13,281 --> 00:09:17,600
it did not suit him and he craved the
adventure of having a career in web and

216
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:18,290
design.

217
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:22,460
He had an entire book filled
with incredible inventions
that would not be made

218
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:23,630
until years later.

219
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,870
This included things like a tanker,

220
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,870
giant crossbow,

221
00:09:26,871 --> 00:09:28,010
underwater scuba gear,

222
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:30,080
and even a robotic soldier.

223
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,020
He was truly a hundreds of
years ahead of his time,

224
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,140
but without a war of these weapons,

225
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,070
they never actually came to life.

226
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,160
Leonardo Da Vinci,

227
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,680
you plan to move to Milan,

228
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,900
the most northern Italian status.

229
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,200
He also wanted to secure employment
before he made that Johnny.

230
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,270
So we know why he wants
us to leave Florence,

231
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:48,830
but why did he choose Milan?

232
00:09:48,831 --> 00:09:48,951
Well,

233
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:50,810
that's because the city
was much closer to France,

234
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:54,350
so there were far more interested in
gathering weapons to defend the country.

235
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,540
Da Vinci sends a lesser
to the Duke of Milan,

236
00:09:56,541 --> 00:09:59,170
claiming that he was a
weapon design expert.

237
00:09:59,171 --> 00:10:01,790
And the included a few
pages from his sketch book.

238
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,920
At the very ends of the letter,

239
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:06,380
he also included a single line
mentioning that he was also a painter.

240
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,470
This [inaudible] Vico sportster,

241
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,040
the temporary Duke of Milan.

242
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,140
He was holding this
position of power in Zilla.

243
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:13,520
His nephew came of age.

244
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,920
This faults family had not
been in power for very long,

245
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,050
especially compared to the
likes of the muddy cheese.

246
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:22,460
So volt's a invited Leonardo Da
Vinci to visit and he was overjoyed,

247
00:10:22,461 --> 00:10:26,420
hoping that he would finally be able to
make that career change that he wanted.

248
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,411
But once he got there,

249
00:10:27,411 --> 00:10:30,620
he was gravely disappointed to find
out that the Duke wanted him to paint a

250
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:33,020
portrait of his beautiful mistress today,

251
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:35,120
that Boucher discord lady with an Amen.

252
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,420
Even though he came to Milan
to escape being a painter,

253
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,300
he's still blew people
away with his talents.

254
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,480
So also was so impressed
that he commissioned a statue
of a 24 foot tall horse.

255
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,690
Da Vinci told him that it would take
at least three years to complete.

256
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,451
In reality,

257
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:50,661
though,

258
00:10:50,661 --> 00:10:53,910
Da Vinci was stalling for time because
without the help of his old master

259
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:54,650
studio,

260
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,510
he had no idea how it was going to pull
off a 20 foot tall metal cost horse.

261
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,463
There's divorces.

262
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,280
They were establishing themselves and the
Duke of Milan believed that paying for

263
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:08,540
things like metal statues would somehow
prove that permanence in high society.

264
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:09,180
At first,

265
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:12,530
Da Vinci created the horse out of
clay and it was unveiled at a party.

266
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:17,360
It's impressed them so much that Da Vinci
was accepted into this falls or royal

267
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:18,110
court.

268
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:18,950
Unfortunately,

269
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,030
like a lot of his projects,

270
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:20,660
Da Vinci,

271
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,680
while I was in a bit over his head and
he was running out of time by a stroke of

272
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:28,660
luck sports or decided to go to war and
they needed the metal resources for his

273
00:11:28,661 --> 00:11:29,540
armies weapons.

274
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,231
Once again,

275
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:31,910
Leonardo Da Vinci fault that this,

276
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:36,680
this might be the time that he can shine
with his weapons buff that were not

277
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,840
enough resources to pay for that creation.

278
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,260
The Duke of Milan gave him her new
assignment in decorating a church called

279
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:44,090
Santa Maria del Grad Ceo,

280
00:11:44,091 --> 00:11:46,550
which is where he painted
one of his most famous works.

281
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,260
The last suffered at the time.

282
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,100
The priests were actually very annoyed
with him because it took him over three

283
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:55,540
years to the painting
for the next 17 years,

284
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:55,961
Da Vinci,

285
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,440
android,

286
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,820
a life of financial security and
respect and his forces royal court.

287
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,870
During the time that he lived in Milan
da Vinci at a secret projects this,

288
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,550
he never dared to tell anyone.

289
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:09,940
He was dissecting human cadavers
and sketching their bodies,

290
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,560
muscles and organs.

291
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,080
He also made a wax costs of the organs.

292
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,690
Now this all sounds rather
creepy and Da Vinci knew this,

293
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:19,030
which is why he kept this
sketchbook a secrets,

294
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,330
and it only showed up in the
16 hundreds at that time,

295
00:12:22,331 --> 00:12:27,070
autopsies and any other form of disturbing
the dead was frowned upon by the

296
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:27,100
Catholic Church.

297
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,190
You already knew what it was like to
have a solid reputation back in Florence,

298
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,500
so he was far more careful this time,

299
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,810
essentially leading a double life,

300
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,870
even though his sketchbook was
found over a hundred years later,

301
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,250
his studies of the human body,

302
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,780
they were revolutionary and became
the foundation of modern anatomy.

303
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,440
Then I'll do da Vinci would Ronnie's
in notebooks about his scientific

304
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:48,131
experiments,

305
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:52,900
his inventions and autistic
ideas that are of a 15,000 pages.

306
00:12:52,901 --> 00:12:54,280
It was notes that have survived.

307
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,770
Even wrote some of those
notes backwards so you could,

308
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,420
and you read them when
looking in a mirror.

309
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,810
Some people believe that he did this
because he was worried that people would

310
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,860
steal his ideas.

311
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,180
When Leonardo Da Vinci was 50 years old,

312
00:13:11,181 --> 00:13:15,050
this falls or family lost their position
of power and the French invaded Milan.

313
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,520
When they saw the giants play horse
statue of standing on the stage.

314
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,540
They used it for Tanya practice.

315
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:21,590
Then I'll do da Vinci.

316
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:25,040
He had to leave Milan with the bare
necessities including his journals,

317
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:26,990
but he left all of his
works of art behind.

318
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,860
He decided to travel from
place to place once again,

319
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,740
trying to pitch us ideas for
military weaponry around Italy.

320
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,310
He showed the Duke of Venice is ideas
which included a snorkeling suit for

321
00:13:37,311 --> 00:13:39,650
breathing underwater that actually worked.

322
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:44,630
He had ideas on how humans could fly or
walk on the bottom of the ocean given

323
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:45,120
mind.

324
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,610
This was at a time when people didn't
even have clocks or watches to tell time.

325
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,740
While all of his ideas were amazing,

326
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,850
they were far too ahead of his time and
the Duke of Venice didn't find any need

327
00:13:55,851 --> 00:13:56,930
for these inventions.

328
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,710
Da Vinci.

329
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,370
He was forced to reluctantly
move back to Florence.

330
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,860
He was reluctant because if they're that
everyone would still remember his bad

331
00:14:03,861 --> 00:14:04,670
reputation,

332
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,400
but it was actually far worse than that.

333
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,353
By that time,

334
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:12,590
the people had forgotten all about the
name Leonardo Da Vinci and there was a

335
00:14:12,591 --> 00:14:13,760
new genius in town,

336
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,690
Michelangelo,

337
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,670
and he was just 26 years old.

338
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,370
Since the art world in
Florence was so competitive,

339
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:22,610
Leonardo hated Michelangelo
almost immediately.

340
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:27,350
Da Vinci was clearly jealous and had to
find reasons to dislike Michelangelo.

341
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,190
He would rights angrily in his journal
about how he thought the young man was

342
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,960
dirty and undignified.

343
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,650
This is why the long there do you see
in most depictions of Da Vinci actually

344
00:14:36,651 --> 00:14:40,760
spent all of his younger years making
sure that he was always clean shaven and

345
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,680
you're always wore the finest of clothes.

346
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,550
He even had professional musicians playing
music for his clients while they sat

347
00:14:46,551 --> 00:14:48,680
for their portraits and the whole process.

348
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,200
It was sort of like going to a luxury spa.

349
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,710
Michelangelo on the other hands,

350
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,590
he had the polar opposite
approach to his art.

351
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,850
He was so focused on his work that he
would forget to shave for days and that

352
00:14:58,851 --> 00:14:59,900
his beard grow out.

353
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,370
You less chips of stone and dust cover
his home after working on a statue and it

354
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:08,720
was far more like a workshop than a
comfortable place for clients to stay.

355
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,740
The two artists,

356
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:13,700
they deeply disliked each other and
even once got into a fight in public

357
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:17,240
secretly Da Vinci would go home to
write about how depressed he was to be

358
00:15:17,241 --> 00:15:22,010
getting older as well as writing about
the fear and anxiety that ruled his

359
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:22,844
thoughts.

360
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,710
Since da Vinci could no longer secure
his place in the foreign science scene,

361
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,590
he decided to try his
luck at weapon design.

362
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,880
One last time,

363
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:39,270
Pope Alexander had a bastard
son named Cesari board job.

364
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,240
Some people say that he was aggrieved
leader while others see the Bordeaux was a

365
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,770
bloodthirsty really who kills his,

366
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:44,101
anyone.

367
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:44,934
He got in his way,

368
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:48,840
Machiavelli his famous book called the
prince was even based on border as an

369
00:15:48,841 --> 00:15:51,930
example of what a ruler must
do in order to stay in power.

370
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:52,860
Da Vinci centers,

371
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:56,520
sketches to border and finally here
and someone saying yes to his weapons.

372
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,630
He became chief general engineer for
board and supervise the construction of

373
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:01,171
towers,

374
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:05,220
weapons and Birdseye view maps of the
cities which she plans on invading,

375
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,170
which was revolutionary for the time.

376
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,450
Da Vinci got everything that he wanted,

377
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,910
but it was at a price he never expected.

378
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,240
The only reason why Borgia was willing
to pay for the creation of all these

379
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,560
weapons was because he wanted to kill
as many enemies as possible until this

380
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:19,831
point.

381
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:24,690
The idea of war and Sydney being just a
concept to Leonardo Da Vinci and stories

382
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:26,070
of nights going into battle.

383
00:16:26,071 --> 00:16:27,270
It seemed like fun.

384
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,650
For the first time in his life,

385
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:32,970
Da Vinci actually witnessed what a blood
festy battle looked like and it was too

386
00:16:32,971 --> 00:16:34,710
gruesome for him to handle.

387
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,700
He wrote,

388
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,680
truly man is more savage than beast
for our brutality exceeds theirs.

389
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,110
We live by the death of others.

390
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,890
The straw that broke the camel's back
was when Borgia ordered the death of one

391
00:16:46,891 --> 00:16:48,240
of Da Vinci's close friends.

392
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:52,620
He quietly left border in the dead of the
night and moved back to Florence where

393
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,620
he returns to a peaceful
life painting portraits.

394
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,290
After selling those weapons,

395
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:07,700
Leonardo Da Vinci had saved a nice nest
egg for his retirement and it was during

396
00:17:07,701 --> 00:17:09,590
this time that he painted the Mona Lisa.

397
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,780
No one knows for sure who she actually is.

398
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:13,190
There are several theories,

399
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:14,810
but none have been confirmed.

400
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,320
Unlike all those portraits that
were commissions and given away,

401
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:21,980
he carried the portrait of Mona Lisa
with him for the rest of his life.

402
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,491
For once,

403
00:17:22,491 --> 00:17:24,890
this was a piece of art
that was done just for him,

404
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:29,600
but he was constantly changing it because
he never felt he got it exactly right.

405
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,740
During his retirement,

406
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:34,940
he started to build massive wings for
human buildings in the hopes that one day

407
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:35,990
people would fly.

408
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:36,800
He said,

409
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,300
there will be wings for man.

410
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,250
If it is not accomplished by me,

411
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,340
it will be accomplished
someday by some other.

412
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,240
There is a commonly told story that
during a flight attempt with these wings,

413
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:50,190
someone fell and broke their
leg after this failed attempt.

414
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,410
He designed a motor that
would flap the wings,

415
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,850
but it never worked properly.

416
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,480
However,

417
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,350
he did eventually designed the first wing
that looks very much like what we use

418
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,980
in modern day airplanes besides
the patrons that he served,

419
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:03,330
Leonardo Da Vinci was not.

420
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,620
He had a famous around the world.

421
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,300
He intended to publish books,

422
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:08,070
but he never actually
went through with us.

423
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,180
As we mentioned Dahlia,

424
00:18:09,181 --> 00:18:13,020
he wrote and sketched over 15,000
pages on a variety of subjects,

425
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:14,370
but he was a perfectionist,

426
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,900
so he continued to add more and more
information because he never felt that his

427
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:19,950
work was complete.

428
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,700
Among these notes are multiple
sketches of an old man with a beard.

429
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,190
Maybe we'll assume that
this was his self portrait,

430
00:18:26,191 --> 00:18:27,630
but no one knows for sure.

431
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,260
However,

432
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,260
this image is used to portray him in
popular culture and it's how he is

433
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:33,570
remembered today.

434
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,141
Now,

435
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:34,771
King Frances,

436
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:38,580
the first of France had been collecting
Da Vinci's pieces for years since he

437
00:18:38,581 --> 00:18:42,210
wrote a letter to Da Vinci inviting
him to live in his Chateau de Vinci.

438
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,910
He agreed to move to France
when he was 65 years old.

439
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,691
He had a stroke,

440
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:47,820
which paralyzed is on the king's castle,

441
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:50,280
became his comfortable retirement place,

442
00:18:50,281 --> 00:18:53,310
and he was given the very best
medical cath and money could buy.

443
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,870
When he died in the year 1519 he left the
Mona Lisa rent all of his sketch books

444
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:00,990
and journals to his law and
apprentice born a bastard,

445
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,310
Leonardo da Vinci,

446
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,660
died like a king.

447
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,970
His life lives on forever and as well,

448
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:06,310
I continue.

449
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,920
We'll continue to serve as an inspiration
to people around the world for

450
00:19:10,921 --> 00:19:12,000
centuries to come.

451
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,620
So I really hope you found that video.
