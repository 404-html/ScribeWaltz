1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,880
When we think about the civil rights
movement in the United States,

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:07,410
most people immediately think of Martin
Luther King Jr and almost everyone can

3
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:09,930
recite the beginning of
his either dream speech,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,920
but the story of another
human rights activists,

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,580
Malcolm X is often
sensitive in history costs.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,360
He is misunderstood as somebody preached
hate and violence against white people

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,180
and some believe that if young
people watched his speeches,

8
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:23,880
it could actually be rather
dangerous because of that,

9
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:27,120
his memory is often swept under the
rug while everyone knows him by name.

10
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:29,640
Not Enough people know the
true story of Malcolm x.

11
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,390
He was one of the most influential
Americans who ever lived and his legacy,

12
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:35,760
it's still that goes on to this very day.
Without him,

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,050
the u s and maybe even the entire world's
would be a really different place in

14
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:41,040
today's buying graphics.

15
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:44,250
We're going to talk about the
incredible life of Malcolm x.

16
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:01,040
A boy named Malcolm little was
born on May the 19th 1925 in Omaha,

17
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,850
Nebraska.

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:05,740
He was one of seven children belonging
to Louise and Earl little Malkin's.

19
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:08,690
Barron's taught their children all
about the history of slavery and the

20
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:12,590
importance of rising above their
circumstances. Now can any siblings,

21
00:01:12,591 --> 00:01:16,700
they were all extremely well behaved
even from a young age because they knew

22
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,670
that they were trying to represent
their race in a positive light.

23
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,410
His father oh believes in the teachings
of a man called Marcus Garvey black

24
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:28,310
nationalist leader who
preached that African Americans
should be self sufficient

25
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:32,000
when it came to running their own
farms and their own businesses. Oh,

26
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:35,690
was a baptist minister who pushed for
desegregation between white and black

27
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:36,710
people.
Because of this,

28
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:40,070
the family received death threats
from the KKK on a daily basis,

29
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:43,040
so they were constantly
moving just to stay alive.

30
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,840
In 1929 oh little bought his family a
four Acre farm in Lansing, Michigan,

31
00:01:47,841 --> 00:01:50,330
which had a very good
neighborhood with great schools.

32
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:53,840
The only issue was that they were
the only black family in town. Now,

33
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,420
hey isn't something that children
are born with. So Americans,

34
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:59,420
classmates in kindergarten treated
him just like everyone else.

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,630
Malcolm's favorite game was Robin hoods
and he always invited his friends over

36
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:06,800
to run through the fields and the forests
of his family farm pretending to steal

37
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,660
from the rich and give to the poor.

38
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,910
Eventually the racist
members of the community.

39
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:14,900
They caught wind of this black family
living a comfortable middle class life and

40
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,340
while I didn't like it,

41
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:19,490
the neighbors complained saying that
black people should not be allowed to own

42
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:23,090
so much land even though there was no
law saying that they couldn't live there.

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:27,170
The local council voted on the issue and
degreed that the little family had to

44
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:31,400
move all this all refuse to leave saying
that his family had every right to stay,

45
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,810
that Lansing Michigan was
home to an offshoot of the
KKK called the Black Legion

46
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,330
is that of wearing silly white
robes with pointed hoods.

47
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,050
They dressed up and even
sillier pirate costumes.

48
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:44,240
You really couldn't make
these things up one night,

49
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,130
the list of family or
work to an explosion.

50
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:49,480
As these white supremacists held
bombs of their house earlier,

51
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,100
newies had to wake up the
children and get them to safety.

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
Despite the explosions,

53
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:56,330
which could certainly be heard
for miles local firefighters.

54
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,530
They never showed up to help and
the house it burned to the grounds.

55
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:02,110
In the morning,
I'll this or confronted the local police.

56
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,390
He accused them of being
members of the Black Legion.

57
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,690
The police responded by arresting and
vast and saying that he burned down the

58
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,420
house to receive an insurance settlement.
The charges,

59
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,460
they were late to drop even after this,

60
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:16,270
they refuse to leave because they wanted
to be an example of the black family

61
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,050
who stood their ground and didn't give
up without a fight. Unfortunately,

62
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:23,200
their strength and resolve it was not
enough to convince the citizens of Lansing

63
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:27,010
that they were worthy of living there.
When Malcolm was just six years old,

64
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:30,370
L's body was found crushed on the
tracks of a street car, the car,

65
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,710
enough rules in accidents.

66
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:35,860
The police said that he committed suicide
and his autobiography of Malcolm x

67
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,980
explains that his father had sustained
injuries and all consistent with the

68
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:39,940
street car accidents.

69
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,080
Despite the coroner statements to the
Insurance Company that tells l policy

70
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,460
refuse to pay. Louise. Due to that
contention that ELLs death was a suicide,

71
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,390
Malcolm's mother had a very difficult
time raising eight children alone.

72
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,490
She sold many of their
belongings into which,

73
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,910
so for people in town in order to make
an income, she rented their lands,

74
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,580
other local farmers, but there was
never enough money to go around.

75
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,660
She was a proud woman,

76
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:05,410
though she lived by our principals and
she never asked for a handout from anyone.

77
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,790
The family, they seem not to go on
welfare, but as the years went on,

78
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,290
the weight of the responsibility
continue to tear away.

79
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,840
Atta Louise knew that
the white people in town,

80
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,320
they hated her and that the men
responsible for her husband's death.

81
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,730
They were I think twice by,

82
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,080
she was constantly afraid that someone
would come off to and to children even

83
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,060
though her fears were
completely justified.

84
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,050
She was diagnosed as paranoid and that
local police committed her to a mental

85
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:29,884
institution.

86
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:33,970
Malcolm was 13 when his mother was taken
away and he and his six siblings were

87
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:36,700
split up and sent to
orphanages and foster homes.

88
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,780
They kept in touch by writing letters
to another and swore that they would all

89
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:43,960
reunite again someday just
by all of these setbacks.

90
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:47,920
Malcolm still had a lot of ambition for
himself and he never forgot the lessons

91
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,810
that his parents taught him.
In the eighth grade,

92
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:53,560
he was a straight a students and at the
top of his class he was intelligent,

93
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:56,170
charismatic, and they had a
passion for public speaking.

94
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,190
What do you went to high school?

95
00:04:57,191 --> 00:05:00,910
He joined the debate team and
continue downing a 4.0 GPA.

96
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,360
One of his teachers asked everyone what
they wanted to be when they grew up and

97
00:05:04,361 --> 00:05:06,250
Malcolm said that he
wanted to become a lawyer.

98
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,530
The teacher said that this was impossible,

99
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:12,080
saying that black people were simply
not allowed to be liars is steep.

100
00:05:12,081 --> 00:05:16,360
Show up for the responded. One of life's
first needs is for us to be realistic.

101
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,610
You need to think of something you can be.

102
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,670
Why don't you plan on
carpentry in Rihanna?

103
00:05:21,671 --> 00:05:25,180
[inaudible] name's Malcolm bl and had
already become America's first black

104
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:29,170
lawyer in the 18 hundreds but of course
Malcolm could not have known that he

105
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,340
believes his teacher was right.

106
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,700
He was still living in foster care and
he no longer had his mother and father to

107
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,860
encourage him despite being
a straight a students.

108
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:37,540
He thought that as a black person,

109
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,240
there truly was no point
in continuing at school.

110
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,600
He dropped out in order to begin
working and start a new life.

111
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,070
When he was 17 Malcomb moved to
New York City to live in Harlem.

112
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:56,490
He got a job doing dishes at a restaurant
and is charismatic person now as he

113
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:00,200
helps him make a lot of friends of all
races, why men begins to approach him,

114
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:03,560
asking if he had any drugs,
if he could hook them up with black girls.

115
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,530
Since people were already making
that assumption based on stereotypes,

116
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:09,020
he decided that he might as
well take advantage of it.

117
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,580
This started is successful side hustle of
being a pimp, a robber or rackets here,

118
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,740
and a drug dealer. He
befriended John L. Roy Sanford,

119
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,480
fellow dishwasher at Jimmy's chicken
shack and haul who aspired to be a

120
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:24,370
professional comedian. Both
men had reddish has say
Sanford was called Chicago,

121
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:28,110
red off to his hometown and
little was known as Detroit red.

122
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,920
He has later at Sanford
became famous as Red Fox.

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,250
One of littles best friends was a
teenage boy. He had his first name,

124
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,050
Malcolm Jarvis,
the two of them.

125
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:38,990
They hustle together and they would
go out to jazz clubs at night.

126
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,740
They was zoot suits and impress. The
ladies with their dance moves for a wall.

127
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:47,000
They were raking in a loss of money and
having the time of that lives in 1949

128
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,150
the two Malcolm's were both dating
white girls who they met at a nightclub.

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,020
These girls had very rich parents and
they were bored cup to maniacs looking for

130
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:54,920
a bit of excitement.

131
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,880
They encouraged the Malcolm's to form a
Bonnie and Clyde star ganged together.

132
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,830
They would let the boys
know whenever their parents,

133
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:04,370
neighbors were on vacation and then they
would all go and steal from the homes

134
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:08,600
together. Malcolm, Mr felt that he was
playing a grown up version of Robin Hood,

135
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,770
but when the group was caught,

136
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,220
it caused a huge outrage in the
courts because of them mixed races.

137
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,340
No one could believe that to rich white
girls could have possibly been at the

138
00:07:16,341 --> 00:07:17,740
masterminds behind the robberies,

139
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,420
and of course their parents
could afford to get them lawyers.

140
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,430
So the girlfriend's lied
under roof cleaning,

141
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,060
that they didn't even know the boys and
that they had been kidnapped and forced

142
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:29,870
to participate in the
robbery. Both Malcolm's, we're
only 20 years at the time,

143
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:34,040
and they both received the maximum
sentence of eight to 10 years in prison.

144
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,570
The women were able to walk free without
any punishments. When he was in prison,

145
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,440
Malcon realized that many black men were
totally innocent and had been falsely

146
00:07:42,441 --> 00:07:44,540
accused of crimes.
These innocent men,

147
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,730
they turned to God in order
to cope with their feet.

148
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,470
But this made Malcolm very angry.

149
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,220
He had become a staunch atheist because
he believed that if there were truly a

150
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,430
god, he wouldn't let black people
suffer like they were suffering.

151
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,020
He yells at other inmates.

152
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,860
We being stupid enough to believe in God
and claims that even if he did exist,

153
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,950
he had abandoned his black people
completely. An elder inmate,

154
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:08,060
John Bembry could see that he was
very angry and in a lot of pain.

155
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,360
So he told Malcolm this.
If he could not escape through religion,

156
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:15,080
he should turn to books instead because
it could help transport his mind to

157
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:15,914
other places.

158
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,640
Malcolm took this advice and began to
read every book in the Prison Library for

159
00:08:19,641 --> 00:08:20,750
the first time in his life.

160
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,720
He was reading Shakespeare and all
of the other great works since he,

161
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,300
Trudy did escape into his own mind,

162
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,000
often being in prison for some time.

163
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:37,570
One of Malcolm's brothers wrote to him
explaining that his siblings and finally

164
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:41,320
reunited and they were attending meetings
of a group called the nation of Islam,

165
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,900
Malcolm right bags that he
did not believe in any god,

166
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,780
but there's brother promised him
that if he started praying to Allah,

167
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,400
he would get out of prison early.

168
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,130
His brother sent him a book
written by Elijah Muhammad,

169
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,740
who was the leader of the nation of Islam.
In his book,

170
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,390
Elijah Muhammad wrote that black people
were already going through that own

171
00:08:57,391 --> 00:09:01,320
version of hell on earth and that's
white men with ad demonic oppresses the

172
00:09:01,321 --> 00:09:05,100
nation of Islam shed some
of the traditional beliefs
of Middle Eastern Islam,

173
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:09,420
but it mostly focuses on raising the
confidence of black people saying this.

174
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,530
They were actually the superior race.
He encouraged them to educate themselves,

175
00:09:13,531 --> 00:09:16,080
become self sufficient,
and have pride in their race.

176
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,740
This was basically the way that Malcolm
had been raised by his parents and it

177
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:23,850
was clear that Elijah Muhammad's teachings
paralleled those of Marcus Garvey.

178
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,400
Malcolm decided to give the
nation of Islam the chance,

179
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:28,710
even though he had never
set foot in a mosque before.

180
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,260
He started to grow his beard,
refuse to eat pork.

181
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:34,260
Parkins prayed to other several
times a day. The prison guards,

182
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,340
they tried to stop him,

183
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,520
so he wrote to the governor demanding
that is an American citizen.

184
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,980
He should have the right
to choose his religion.

185
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,940
Say positive at large in Muhammad's
teachings was to stop trying to please or

186
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,110
integrate into white society and take
pride in being an African American.

187
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
Some Alpha dropped his last name,

188
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:54,210
little which was given to his ancestors
when they were slaves as a sign of

189
00:09:54,211 --> 00:09:54,900
ownership.

190
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,560
He had no idea what his family is real
African tribal name had been so he

191
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:03,120
decided to replace it with a simple x
representing the missing family history

192
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:06,060
that had been stolen from him.
He lays you wrote for me,

193
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,120
my ex replaced the white
slave master name of little,

194
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:14,180
which some blue eyed devil names little
imposed upon my potato forebears.

195
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,930
Now there's,
he went by Malcolm x.

196
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,860
He started a debate team and the prison
and men would go to listen to him speak.

197
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:23,340
He was such an amazing
speaker that several other
men were convinced to join the

198
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,770
nation of Islam and they
began to pray together.

199
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,590
Instead of being meek and
subservient to the white gods,

200
00:10:28,591 --> 00:10:31,470
they stood tool and suddenly seemed Fomo,
confidence,

201
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:34,590
and powerful than ever before.
This made the prison guards nervous.

202
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,860
They thought that Malcolm x might
have too much control and those he was

203
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:40,650
released. He would incite
riots and start a race war.

204
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:45,180
The warden notifying the FBI and he was
placed on a watch list and denied parole

205
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,440
despite his good behavior.

206
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:49,860
He was finally released from prison after
six years and he immediately became a

207
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,680
Minnesota for the nation of
Islam and Detroit, Michigan.

208
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,250
He was so good at speaking that he was
given the position of national spokesman

209
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,390
when he first got started.

210
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,140
Elijah Mohammed only had managed to gather
500 members into the nation of Islam

211
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:05,550
in the United States in 1952 but once
Malcolm x toward and gave speeches,

212
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:08,340
it quickly grew to over 30,000 members.

213
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:13,610
By 1963 Malcolm x was constantly trying
to build up the confidence of African

214
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:14,280
American people.

215
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,970
He encouraged black people to feel proud
of that natural hair and their dark

216
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:20,850
skin and never trying to compare
themselves to white people.

217
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,470
He encouraged them to open their own
businesses in Harlem, barbershops,

218
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,380
butches restaurants and clothing stores
owned by black people sprang up for the

219
00:11:28,381 --> 00:11:30,810
very first time in American history,
this box,

220
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,090
a trend across the nation
and lack of businesses.

221
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:35,100
They became commonplace
in all major cities.

222
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:38,400
It was at this point that Malcolm x
met and fell in love with a woman named

223
00:11:38,401 --> 00:11:40,920
Betty Sanders.
Since the two they got married,

224
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,940
they would go on to have six daughters
together. Malcolm started a fraternity,

225
00:11:44,941 --> 00:11:46,560
agree of cooled the fruit of Islam.

226
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,100
These were men who were like a private
militia. They were always clean.

227
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:52,290
Cartons were brand new suits with pride.

228
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,020
They would and he taught them
to never use violence and less.

229
00:11:56,021 --> 00:11:57,820
It was in self defense.
After all,

230
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,910
peaceful civil rights protestors
were being hosed down,

231
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,520
beaten by police and attacks by God dogs.

232
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,400
He believed that if they wanted
to get things done successfully,

233
00:12:06,401 --> 00:12:10,120
they needed to prepare for the possibility
that if they began to fight for their

234
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:14,380
rights, it might cause a war between black
and white people. The fruit of Islam.

235
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,450
They were taught never to attack fast,

236
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:19,480
but they should not accept
a beating without fighting.

237
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:24,220
Back on April the 26th 1957 one of
the members of their congregation,

238
00:12:24,221 --> 00:12:25,480
Johnson x Henson,

239
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,620
was taking suits out of his car in front
of the Muslim 10 building in New York

240
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:33,640
City. Police officers saw this and
they accused him of stealing the suits.

241
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,280
When he tried to explain that
they belong to the congregation,

242
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:39,640
they beat him with heavy clubs and
detained him in the police station without

243
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,810
giving him medical attention.

244
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,170
Malcolm x seat rushed in the police
station and asked to see Johnson.

245
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,650
When they told him to leave, he told
the officers to look out the window.

246
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,510
A line of men wearing crisp suits,

247
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,840
sunglasses and for doors were
all standing out on the streets.

248
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,010
It was an entire army of the fruit
of Islam ready for Malka disorders.

249
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,200
When they finally agreed
to let him see Johnson.

250
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,490
Malcolm demanded that they
call an ambulance because
he was bleeding heavily and

251
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,790
dying of his injuries. The militia
followed them all the way to the hospital,

252
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,800
but it was confirmed that
Johnson would survive.

253
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,520
Now waved his hands and
the militia dispersed,

254
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,870
preventing what would
have been a massive right.

255
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:18,550
This terrified the NYP d and it was clear
that even though they had no idea who

256
00:13:18,551 --> 00:13:22,240
he was until that day, he was a
very powerful man in New York City.

257
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:26,200
One officer was quoted as saying,
no man should have that much power.

258
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:29,260
It needs to try to sue the city to
pay for Hinton's medical expenses,

259
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:30,490
but they denied everything.

260
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,150
Malcolm x decided to travel across the
country and convert new people to the

261
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:34,984
nation of Islam.

262
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,250
They eventually opened to Muslim temple
in Los Angeles in 1962 and almost

263
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:41,830
identical situation
happened all over again.

264
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:45,850
A man named Ronald Stokes was taking the
dry cleaning out of a car in front of

265
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:46,450
the mosque.

266
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,510
The police accused him of stealing the
suits and when he tried to explain,

267
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,720
he put his hands up and they
again shooting him at close range.

268
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,410
11 men rush to help their friends and
tried to pull the police officers away,

269
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,710
but they were all arrested and they
were all accused of being part of a

270
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,840
so-called mob in the local newspaper.

271
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,740
It was printed that this was a Muslim
riot in courts and the police officer who

272
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:09,380
shot and killed Ronald stakes and method
that he knew that stokes was unarmed,

273
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,570
but that he shot him first because he
raised his hands in a menacing way and

274
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:14,770
just 25 minutes,

275
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,610
the white jury decided that this was
enough justification to murder him and the

276
00:14:18,611 --> 00:14:22,570
officer he was set free. Immediately
after this man got away with murder,

277
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,860
11 members of Nation of Islam were found
guilty of assaulting a police officer

278
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:29,870
and they were all sent to prison.
After this incidence,

279
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:33,520
Malcolm x realize that the fight was
too much for even the nation of Islam to

280
00:14:33,521 --> 00:14:34,000
handle.

281
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,360
He calls for all black people to come
together regardless of their religion.

282
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:40,210
In order to fight for civil
rights following stags, his death.

283
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:43,780
Malcolm x gave one of his most
famous speeches. We are oppressed,

284
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,620
we are exploited, we are downtrodden.
We are denied not just civil rights,

285
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,730
but human rights.

286
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,430
So the only way we are going to get
some of this oppression and exploitation

287
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,760
away from us is to come
together against a common enemy.

288
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,020
For years, Malcolm x was the
face of the nation of Islam,

289
00:15:05,021 --> 00:15:07,850
and even though he was spreading
the teachings of his mentor,

290
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,180
Elijah Muhammad's the man, rarely did
any of the work himself. Once a month,

291
00:15:12,181 --> 00:15:15,930
Malcolm would visit Chicago to give money
to Mohammad for his living expenses.

292
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,410
One day he ran into three young women
who were knocking on Muhammad's door.

293
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,470
They were demanding that he give them
money for food and child support.

294
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:26,170
He learned from them that Elijah Muhammad
had cheated on his wife and eight

295
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,140
children with six different secretaries.

296
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,170
The girls were all only 16
or 17 years old at the time.

297
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:33,420
So this was also a statutory rape.

298
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,440
He was not taking responsibility for
his kids and he had ruins the lives of

299
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:40,140
these young women. Malcolm
Austin, Elijah's son wireless.

300
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:43,530
If this was actually true, when's he
admitted that he and his mother knew,

301
00:15:43,531 --> 00:15:44,940
but they were in denial.

302
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:49,050
The followers were so blindly faithful
to Elijah Mohammad's that even when the

303
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:52,080
word spread that the founder of the
religion was a liar and a hypocrite,

304
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,750
they accused Wallace of
lying about his father.

305
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,340
Mohammed confirmed the room is in 1963
attempting to justify his behavior by

306
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,280
referring to precedents
set by biblical prophets.

307
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:05,580
Malcolm x did not leave nation
of Islam right away though,

308
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,140
but he did distance himself.

309
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,860
He focused more on preaching about
the civil rights movements for a time.

310
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,670
He thought that he had been tricked into
living a lie since he was struggling

311
00:16:14,671 --> 00:16:15,630
with this Muslim faith.

312
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:20,550
Malcolm x took a pilgrimage to Makkah in
Saudi Arabia in 1964 he was shocked to

313
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:23,550
see people of all races making
the pilgrimage together.

314
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,400
Elijah Muhammad's was teaching
that white people were evil,

315
00:16:26,401 --> 00:16:28,920
but once Malcolm saw
what true Islam was like,

316
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:33,180
he knew this was proof that Brotherhood
amongst the human race could exist.

317
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,920
He'd seen it with his own eyes.

318
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,670
He no longer believe that Martin Luther
King Jr was preaching a pipe dream.

319
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,600
He was inspired to give himself a new
name. I'll hogene Malik, I'll Shahbaz.

320
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,060
He spent an additional three
weeks traveling around,

321
00:16:45,061 --> 00:16:47,970
so several countries in Africa.
When you were to the United States,

322
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,680
he was a completely changed man.

323
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,640
He no longer preach that white men
were devils and he said that all people

324
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,010
needed to come together and live in peace.

325
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,060
On march the eighth 1964 he announced
that he was leaving the nation of Islam

326
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:03,570
and he exposed all of the corruption
that he had kept secret. Until then,

327
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,150
he can bad the religion
to a mafia crime ring.

328
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:08,160
This he no longer wanted to be a part of.

329
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,050
He said that if anyone
wants to follow him,

330
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,250
he was going to start up his own
Muslim group called Muslim mosque inc.

331
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,310
This was a huge threat to Elijah
Muhammad's livelihood. Of course,

332
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,830
and if at a target on Malcolm's back,

333
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:25,170
are you not perhaps afraid of what might
happen to you as a result of making

334
00:17:25,171 --> 00:17:28,320
these revelations? Oh yes. I
probably am a dead man already.

335
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,880
Malcolm received death threats,

336
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:33,750
but he kept moving and began traveling
with a new found motivation to bring

337
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,160
peace to all nations.

338
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,780
He became an international diplomat and
traveled to 14 African countries meeting

339
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,190
with 11 heads of state.

340
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,270
He wants it to discuss the treatments of
African Americans and the human rights

341
00:17:45,271 --> 00:17:47,010
issues that they were facing in America.

342
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:51,510
He encouraged the United Nations step
in to help black people in the United

343
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,580
States since he believed
that the American government,

344
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,990
we're not doing enough to support the
rights of black people, the FBI and CIA.

345
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:01,470
They were following him wherever he went
and he was receiving harassing phone

346
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:02,670
calls on a daily basis.

347
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,220
Elijah Muhammad told Boston Minister
Louis acts later known as Louis Farrakhan

348
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,620
that hypocrites like Malcolm
should have their heads cut off,

349
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,160
and the April 10th edition of Muhammad
speaks featured a cartoon depicting

350
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:17,430
Malcolm x is bouncing severed heads.
His house in New York,

351
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,790
it was later firebombs and his wife
and daughters were very nearly killed.

352
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,870
Malcolm x publicly announced that he
knew Elijah Muhammad had ordered a hit on

353
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:28,380
his life and that he was going
to die soon. Unfortunately,

354
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,630
it was right in 1965 Malcolm x was
giving a speech in New York City when a

355
00:18:33,631 --> 00:18:37,200
member of the nation of Islam shot him
in the chest at close range with a sawed

356
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,110
off shotgun to other men,
five semiautomatic handguns.

357
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,780
He had 21 gunshot wounds on his body.

358
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,450
He was 39 years old or an activist.

359
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:50,040
Ossie Davis delivered the
eulogy describing Malcolm
x's are shining black prince

360
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,950
who didn't hesitate to
die because he loved us.

361
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:57,450
So Malcolm x was only just beginning
his new goal of attempting to change the

362
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:59,130
lives of African Americans everywhere,

363
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,490
and there is no way of knowing just how
much you would have accomplished if he

364
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,710
was given that chance before his death.

365
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,190
He had admitted that he had made a
mistake by preaching hate against white

366
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:12,270
people when he first got started and he
was ready and willing to go along with

367
00:19:12,271 --> 00:19:16,600
Martin Luther King and the civil rights
movement if he were still alive today.

368
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,520
There is no telling just how much more
he would have accomplished even in his

369
00:19:20,521 --> 00:19:21,420
short time on earth.

370
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:25,500
He inspired African Americans to be the
people proud of their skin color because

371
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:29,670
of him. Black people everywhere began to
demand more for themselves and from the

372
00:19:29,671 --> 00:19:31,950
expectations of everyone in their country.

373
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,380
No matter what religion
someone is subscribed to,

374
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,370
they can still find inspiration from
listening to his speeches about human

375
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,500
rights and whether they know it or not.

376
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,550
There is so much in American society
that would have never existed without the

377
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:48,060
influence of Malcolm x. So I already
have you found that video. Interesting.
