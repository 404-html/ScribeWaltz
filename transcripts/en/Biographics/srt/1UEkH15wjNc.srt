1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,760
It was the all American boy,

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,280
handsome,

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,820
smart,

4
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:03,420
charming.

5
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:03,841
In fact,

6
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:07,770
theodore rubbish Bundy was the stereotype
of what every American boy or to be

7
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:11,580
like and what every American parents
wanted their son to aspire to you.

8
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,330
Above all,

9
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,620
ted Bundy was charming.

10
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,810
He had a winsome way that could in people.

11
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:20,580
Yet this same college wunderkind snuffed
out to the lives of scores of beautiful

12
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,300
young women.

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,680
He was a charismatic killer,

14
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:23,630
who's Jacquelyn hype.

15
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:27,630
As soon as we're so vastly different
that he fooled his closest associates for

16
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:28,320
years,

17
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,170
many of them would still not believe
that there Ted could commit to the

18
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:33,750
atrocious crimes that were
piling up alongside his name,

19
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,850
even as the evidence became overwhelming,

20
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,150
he made a mockery of law enforcement
running rings around their attempts to

21
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,130
catch the world's first serial killer.

22
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,660
Bundys brilliant minds made him a master
Predator with his abductions being as

23
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,490
well planned as a military action.

24
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,630
He has gone down as the most infamous
serial killer in US history today,

25
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,030
decades after his execution
in the electric chair.

26
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,790
He is held up by many
as a macabre celebrity.

27
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,740
The poster boy for mass murder.

28
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,540
His story is a paradox.

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,291
In his past,

30
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,890
there were no signs of the deviant
behavior that would manifest itself in an

31
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:06,240
insatiable bloodlust.

32
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,133
He wasn't in fact,

33
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,320
on track for a brilliant career on the
other side of the law as a prosecuting

34
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:10,830
attorney.

35
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,370
His performance in his own defense showed
what a great promise that Korea had

36
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,620
held upon sentencing Bundy to die.

37
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,480
Judge Edward o coward summed
up the feeling of so many
new ones were affected by

38
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,140
Bundy.

39
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,830
It is a total waste of humanity that
I've ever experienced in this course.

40
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,540
You are a bright young man.

41
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,860
You've made a good lawyer.

42
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,020
I'd have loved to have had
you practice in front of me,

43
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:32,250
but the UN's another way,

44
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,084
Patna.

45
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,530
As we examined Bundy story,

46
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:37,860
we got closer to answering the question
of why he chose the way he did,

47
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,053
but then again,

48
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,410
even with this analysis,

49
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:41,700
we may never really know.

50
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,090
Just before we get started with the
biographics video today about Ted Bundy,

51
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:46,860
if you like this sort of dark stuff,

52
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:48,450
definitely check out
friends of the channel.

53
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,160
There's another channel
called criminally listed.

54
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,001
Go check it out.

55
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,860
You'll find a link to it
in the description below.

56
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,950
Loads of Daca,

57
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,680
stuff like this on that channel,

58
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,730
and let's get into it.

59
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,250
He adored Robert Bundy,

60
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,880
was born to 22 year old element
Lewis Cowl on November the 24th,

61
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:10,960
1946.

62
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,740
His father was a sailor who'd never hung
around to meet his newborn son when he

63
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:15,221
was four.

64
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:15,821
Ted's mother,

65
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,500
who was told was his oldest sister,

66
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,170
took him 3000 miles away to tacoma,

67
00:02:20,171 --> 00:02:22,300
Washington to live with
other family members.

68
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,780
Ted was heartbroken to be taken away
from his grandfather with whom he had

69
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:27,160
developed a special bonds,

70
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,820
although no one ever replaced
his grandfather and his
affection Ted scene became

71
00:02:30,821 --> 00:02:32,470
close friends with his two cousins,

72
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:33,730
Jane and Allan Scott.

73
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,420
Meanwhile,

74
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,970
his mother was making a friendship of it.

75
00:02:35,971 --> 00:02:38,380
Ryan Elena was now going
by the name of Louis.

76
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:42,160
She joins the methodist church and seemed
crossed paths with a young man by the

77
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,000
name of Johnny Colpepper Bundy.

78
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,450
Johnny Bundy stood five foot tall.

79
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,660
He was a cook and came across as
a shy and reserved kind of guy,

80
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,540
but newies sensed that he
was kind and dependable.

81
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,860
Soon Raymond said blossoms after
a well winds of methodists,

82
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:56,740
social functions.

83
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:58,870
Louise and Johnny were
married on May the 19th,

84
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,950
51.

85
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,120
The family bought a home there,

86
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:03,640
narrows bridge while Johnny
kept on working as a cook.

87
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,040
There we use 10 heads to secretarial work.

88
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:09,310
Children followed two boys
and two girls as he grew up.

89
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,620
Ted was often pressed
into babysitting service.

90
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,310
He willingly complied even though it
would usually mean missing out on outings

91
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,144
with friends.

92
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,070
Although the family dynamics were stable,

93
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,030
ted was to grow up in an environment
of untruths and uncertainty.

94
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,600
He was still being fed the line that
his mother was his sister and his

95
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,411
grandparents.

96
00:03:26,411 --> 00:03:28,960
Whereas actual parents during
his years at high school,

97
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:32,380
he ran with kids who had connections
whose parents were either rich or were big

98
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,790
wigs in the school environments.

99
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,410
Ted could never match up,

100
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,251
and as a result,

101
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,590
he was often teased where
others were out giving.

102
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,600
Ted came across as shy and reserved.

103
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:44,560
Ted never warmed up to his father in law
despite Johnny's acceptance of him and

104
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,940
attempts to build a relationship.

105
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,600
When Johnny became a scout leader and
organized camping trips that we usually

106
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:52,900
find some excuse as to why you could
and attendance and adolescence.

107
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,040
Ted grew rapidly,

108
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,470
but he found it very hard
to put on muscular size.

109
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,200
He was too skinny to play football that
we did join the track team at hunter

110
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,083
junior high.

111
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,720
However,

112
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,010
it was a classroom rather than track and
field where Ted felt most comfortable.

113
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,420
He maintained a b average,

114
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,970
taking his schoolwork and
homework very seriously.

115
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:13,420
Ted graduated from Woodrow Wilson
High School in Nineteen 65.

116
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,970
While he was making solid
progress academically,

117
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,780
he was also beginning to build a
reputation that was not so favorable.

118
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,690
He had already been in trouble with
the law in relation to some petty

119
00:04:22,691 --> 00:04:23,500
burglaries.

120
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,170
It was also proving himself
to be an unreliable worker.

121
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,730
After graduating high school,

122
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
10 began working for Tacoma city light.

123
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,760
His plan was to attend college and the
enrolled in the University of puget sound

124
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:36,180
for the 1965 to 1966 year.

125
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Twelve months later be transferred to
the University of Washington in Seattle.

126
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,290
He began living on campus.

127
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,190
There's a dormitory room.

128
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:42,760
It's mcmahon.

129
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,300
Hold,

130
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,530
I think University of Washington,

131
00:04:44,531 --> 00:04:47,020
Ted's winning personality
began to manifest itself.

132
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,950
He was charming,

133
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,611
well dressed,

134
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,900
and came across as educated.

135
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,220
It's professors force.

136
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,001
He was a brilliant,

137
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:55,960
studious individual with enormous
potential deads charmin's good looks,

138
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,900
made people see beyond the
emptiness that was as cool

139
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,740
it was during his freshman year at
Washington u that tat first fell in love.

140
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,570
The object of his desires was a beautiful,

141
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:09,190
dark haired girl that lived nearby.

142
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:09,971
She was,

143
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:13,390
as he would later describe how the most
beautiful creature he had ever seen.

144
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,690
He found out her name was
Stephanie Brooks from a distance,

145
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,553
tad martyr,

146
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,110
studying her like a
specimen under a microscope.

147
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,580
He stared at her in the lunch room,

148
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,200
fantasizing from afar.

149
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:23,741
It seemed,

150
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:27,730
became apparent that Stephanie was into
the football jock crowd and Ted became

151
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,590
despondent despite their differences.

152
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,380
That was one thing that Ted
and Stephanie had in common.

153
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,150
They were both skiers dead thought that
maybe this was his enemy showing signs

154
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,500
of overcoming his insecurities.

155
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,380
So you took the bold step of asking if
he could hit you with her to the ski

156
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:42,700
slopes east of Seattle.

157
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,020
She readily agreed.

158
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,190
Happy to have some company,

159
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,130
and thus this began the start
of their unlikely romance,

160
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,990
the pastor who's spending
more time together,

161
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,441
Stephanie.

162
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,360
It seemed to enjoy his company
and sought him out as potential.

163
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,970
He had become besotted with Stephanie.

164
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,140
Soon they will love us.

165
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,190
Stephanie was 21 to 20.

166
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,140
She was from wealthy California stock.

167
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,030
He was a legitimate.

168
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,630
She grew up in the midst of money.

169
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,100
He didn't have anything yet.

170
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,100
That relationship worked and they
went steady for the next year.

171
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,550
For Stephanie With Tad was
an enjoyable extended fling.

172
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,540
She was in love with him.

173
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,120
Sure.

174
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,480
That's not in the way
that he was with her.

175
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,830
She had known from the start,

176
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,930
but the relationship was
never really going anywhere.

177
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,200
That spend some time together,

178
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,210
enjoy themselves,

179
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:21,530
and then go their separate ways.

180
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,140
After all,

181
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,040
there was no way that
tends to fit into society.

182
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,780
Stephanie's graduation in June,

183
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,650
1968.

184
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,900
It seems like the opportune
time to end the romance.

185
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:32,090
She'd be moving to San
Francisco to find work.

186
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,590
While Ted stayed on in Seattle,

187
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:37,750
a finished his studies to say that Ted
took the rejection from Stephanie badly.

188
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,010
Could be the ultimate understatements.

189
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,500
He was absolutely devastated.

190
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,370
Grime author and rule who worked with
dad on a Seattle a crisis hotline,

191
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:50,360
believes that the breakup
of his relationship with
Stephanie was the catalyst

192
00:06:50,361 --> 00:06:52,400
for everything that
followed in Ted's life.

193
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,480
Ted could not accept that the relationship
was over immediately set about

194
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,220
finding ways to weave Stephanie back.

195
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,760
He also immersed himself in law and
politics as if to drown out the agony of

196
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,420
losing him.

197
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,700
Ted's despondency spreads
through his academic life.

198
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,360
The ones brilliant students was
now struggling by the fall of 1968.

199
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,240
He to crops are completely off.

200
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,840
Several months following in despair.

201
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,030
He re enrolled at the
University of Washington,

202
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,820
taking papers in psychology
that included deviance,

203
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:17,571
personality,

204
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,740
and deviant developments,

205
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:20,030
throwing himself into his studies.

206
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,920
He impressed as professors
as an older student.

207
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:26,240
He was truly gifted despite his rigorous
study schedule to have still found time

208
00:07:26,241 --> 00:07:28,490
to frequent the bars of
the university district.

209
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,000
In September of 1969,

210
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:30,970
the handsome laughable.

211
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:33,800
A young man called the eye
of a woman named Meg Anders.

212
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
They were both alone
at the Sandpiper Tavin.

213
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:40,270
Ted made the first move asking if he
could buy her a beer reluctance of first,

214
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,000
she was soon one over by the Ted Bundy
chant before she knew that she had given

215
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:44,870
him her phone number.

216
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,220
10,

217
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,950
and Megan began spending evenings
together and Megan quickly came under Ted

218
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:49,010
Spell,

219
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,670
falling deeply in love with him in
a sense this was a reversal of Ted's

220
00:07:52,671 --> 00:07:54,320
relationship with Stephanie Mag,

221
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,000
adored the ground that Ted walks on,

222
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,230
yet it was less committed his mind
often on other things and other people.

223
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,850
He was still pining for Stephanie,

224
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,260
but meg would do in the meantime.

225
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,380
Nineteen 69 and 1970.

226
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,280
We're stable years in
the life of Ted Bundy.

227
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,410
He was focused on his academic progress,

228
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:12,950
impressing his professors and gaining
qualifications that would lead to his

229
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,180
chosen legal career.

230
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,270
The relationship with meg was steady
and he was playing the part of surrogate

231
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,620
father to her young daughter.

232
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:20,840
Leanne did this with passionate joy.

233
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:21,970
During 1970,

234
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,860
[inaudible] was awarded a commendation
by the Seattle Police Department's when

235
00:08:24,861 --> 00:08:26,210
he ran down a snap snapchat.

236
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,133
A few months later,

237
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:29,000
he saved a drowning toddler at green lake.

238
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,850
Tend to pretty much transformed
herself into the all American boy.

239
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:32,241
Now,

240
00:08:32,241 --> 00:08:33,560
at the beginning of 1971,

241
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,460
ted took a part time job at the Seattle
crisis clinic situated on Seattle's

242
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:38,294
Capitol Hill.

243
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,160
He did the 9:00 PM to 9:00 AM,

244
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:43,670
shift a few nights a week on a Tuesday
nights between 10:00 PM and 2:00 AM.

245
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:48,260
He was partnered with a 39 year old part
time crime writer named and rule for 10

246
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:48,531
months.

247
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:49,250
They work together,

248
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,320
the crime writer and the
future serial killer.

249
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,140
They worked tirelessly to
help solve people's problems.

250
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,130
On many occasions,

251
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,970
they even helped save people's lives.

252
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,620
That was an amazing counselor.

253
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:01,770
He was always calm and he had an aura
who is voiced that put people at ease.

254
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,490
He reassured he guidance and the
entertainments and empathetically listens.

255
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,230
In April of 1973,

256
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,290
ted was awarded the position
of Assistant to Ross Davis,

257
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,750
chairman of the Washington
State Republican Party,

258
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:13,651
along with the job,

259
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:17,850
came a $100 a month salary use of a
credit card and expenses for travel.

260
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,140
We're paid by this time.

261
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,150
Dads had been with meg for four years.

262
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:21,961
Their relationship,

263
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:22,620
it was steady,

264
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,820
although it often felt like meg was doing
more of the giving than Ted was still.

265
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,650
He was excellent with lists all leanne,

266
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,880
who absolutely adored him.

267
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,930
Marriage seemed just over the horizon
for the couple wants Meghan didn't know

268
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:38,280
was the ted still carried an unquenchable
desire for Stephanie Brooks even when

269
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,480
he and meg when making love.

270
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,650
It was Stephanie's image that was present
in Ted's mind and so it was that when

271
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:46,890
he flew to San Francisco
and the Republican Party
business trip in the summer of

272
00:09:46,891 --> 00:09:49,360
1973 to rob tendons,

273
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:49,771
Stephanie,

274
00:09:49,771 --> 00:09:50,670
they went out for dinner.

275
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,040
She was bowled over by
the changes he had made.

276
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,330
Now he was sophisticated.

277
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,021
He was confident.

278
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:57,660
He was in control and it
appeared he had money.

279
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,471
Ted's plans.

280
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:58,940
He winter,

281
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,930
overworked perfectly ends on partying.

282
00:10:00,931 --> 00:10:04,080
She agreed to come and see him
in Seattle and she did just that.

283
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,470
During how awesome vacation Ted took
Stephanie to dinner at the home of his

284
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:07,861
boss.

285
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:10,440
Ross Davis introduced her as his fiance.

286
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,610
Then he whisked her off
for a weekend in the snow.

287
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:13,231
What a cascade.

288
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:13,920
Poss.

289
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,380
He had books a luxurious come
to for just the two of them.

290
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,790
Over the course of that weekend,

291
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,130
Stephanie fell in love
with Ted all over again.

292
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,230
When he began talking with marriage plans.

293
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,040
She excitedly joined in future
plans for a life of domestic bliss.

294
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:27,150
We're made of course,

295
00:10:27,151 --> 00:10:30,510
neither Stephanie Nor meg knew of
the other's plans to marry Ted Bundy,

296
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,220
often his weekends with Stephanie.

297
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:32,750
However,

298
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,920
he began to evade talk
of marriage with meg.

299
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,850
He seemed to be getting very cold
feet towards the end of 1973.

300
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,900
Ted Managed to coordinate is to love
lives so that he could wine and Dine

301
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,733
Stephanie more liberally.

302
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,050
He brought her to Seattle and they dined
at various restaurants throughout China

303
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:47,730
town.

304
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,241
Strangely,

305
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:50,730
the Stephanie was sensing
that something was different.

306
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,800
It was becoming less affectionate.

307
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,660
He stopped talking about marriage plans.

308
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,870
He confessed that he had been having an
affair with another woman and that she

309
00:10:57,871 --> 00:10:59,250
had ended up having an abortion.

310
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,630
He was becoming cold,

311
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,261
clinical,

312
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:02,910
and uncaring towards Stephanie.

313
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,360
He didn't even buy her Christmas present
despite our attempts to get to the

314
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,220
bottom of his strange change in attitudes.

315
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,150
Stephanie was unable to discover
why Ted had become so cold to water.

316
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,900
He simply wouldn't let her in.

317
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,770
When she flew back to San Francisco
at the start of the new year,

318
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,780
Ted appeared to be glad
to be getting rid of her.

319
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,530
Stephanie waited for Ted to reach out
for an explanation as to why he attends,

320
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,580
but it never came.

321
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,440
In February of 1974,

322
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,810
she phones him angrily
demanding an explanation.

323
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,970
He simply hung up on her hands with that,

324
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:31,840
Stephanie would never again speak to tat.

325
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,800
During the first six months of 1974,

326
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:40,920
eight women went missing from
college campuses in Washington,

327
00:11:40,921 --> 00:11:41,311
Oregon,

328
00:11:41,311 --> 00:11:42,120
and Utah.

329
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,830
When you look at the
photos of these women,

330
00:11:43,831 --> 00:11:46,950
you can't help but be struck
by how much they looked alike.

331
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:48,300
They all had small frames,

332
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,980
long hair that was parted in the middle,

333
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,440
and what good looking every one of
them resembled Stephanie Brooks.

334
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,030
As the case files mounted.

335
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:56,470
The killer left no trace.

336
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,380
Investigators were surprised
and immensely frustrated.

337
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:03,700
The demand could commit
such brazen abductions and
leave absolutely no trace of

338
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,690
evidence in its wake.

339
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,290
Indeed,

340
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:07,900
each attack would be slightly
more brazen than the last.

341
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,830
The adapter would snatch girls who were
in closer proximity to others almost as

342
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,630
if he was daring anyone to stop him.

343
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:19,790
Located at the southern end of
Lake Sammamish and King County,

344
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,860
Washington Lake Sammamish state park.

345
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:26,861
It covers 512 acres and features
6,858 feet of waterfront.

346
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:31,490
The level landscape features buttercup
filled pastures and is dotted with trees

347
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,080
in the summer of 1974.

348
00:12:33,081 --> 00:12:36,590
It was a popular bathing spot and sunning
spot for thousands of local residence.

349
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,050
Lifeguards patrolled and it
was a range is hot on site.

350
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,070
On July the 14th,

351
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,100
1974 legs and Hamish was packed with
excess of 40,000 people who were eager to

352
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:47,300
make the most of the
glorious summer weather.

353
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,660
Among the throngs of Sunseeker is on
that day was an attractive woman who was

354
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:54,560
sunbathing by herself on the beach no
sooner had she settled into a tanning

355
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:54,951
session.

356
00:12:54,951 --> 00:12:57,380
Then she looked up to see
a man towering over hat.

357
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:00,260
He was wearing a white t shirt
and jeans and his right arm.

358
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:01,094
Was it a cost?

359
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,000
Excuse me.

360
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,870
I'm sorry to bother you.

361
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,670
He began.

362
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,330
I was wondering if you could help me out.

363
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,500
The gold looks over at him.

364
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,960
He was good looking and seemed
somewhat nerdy to happen.

365
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,740
She didn't sense any danger from him.

366
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,620
Help you out with what she asked.

367
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:16,550
He had knelt down beside her and explained
that he needed to launch a sail boat,

368
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,440
but couldn't do it with this cast on it.

369
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,800
He offered to take her for a ride in the
boats and he was exceedingly charming.

370
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,310
Yes,

371
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,031
she would go with him.

372
00:13:23,031 --> 00:13:26,840
She said as they were walking to
where the man said his sailboat was.

373
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:31,010
He offered his name tat it was about
this time that the girl got cold feet.

374
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,700
She begged off saying that the parents
were waiting for her to other young women

375
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:35,511
of the leg that day.

376
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:36,470
They weren't so lucky.

377
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,140
Twenty three year olds
jenise often to 18 year olds.

378
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,170
Denise Naslund winds along with
Ted's and were never seen again.

379
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,480
Ted had dramatically onto the stakes.

380
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,290
Not only had he freely given
his name to a potential victim,

381
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:51,230
but he had approached at least six
women on that Sunday afternoon in broad

382
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,860
daylight.

383
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,570
Clearly he was feeling invincible.

384
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,570
There was nothing that the bundling law
enforcement officials could do to stop

385
00:13:56,571 --> 00:13:56,990
him.

386
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,790
He was far too clever for them police.

387
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,820
They were able to produce a composite
sketch of Ted based on the statements of

388
00:14:01,821 --> 00:14:02,654
the eye witnesses.

389
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,760
This was circulated up
and down the country.

390
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,220
Three thousand 500 tips
poured in from the public.

391
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,440
The police compiled a list
of potential suspects.

392
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:10,520
Name Ted Bundy.

393
00:14:10,521 --> 00:14:11,810
His name was on that list,

394
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,060
but it has more than 2000 people on it.

395
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,170
Ted's moved to Salt Lake
City on Thanksgiving weekends
in 1974 to attend law

396
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:21,710
school.

397
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,770
Immediately secured a job as a
security guard at the university.

398
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,670
The initial focus of the Utah killings,

399
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,750
it was one of the small towns that lead
within the vicinity of Salt Lake City.

400
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,110
They began on October,

401
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:31,580
second,

402
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,660
1974,

403
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,220
the victim with 16 year olds,

404
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,240
Nancy Wilcox.

405
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,860
She disappeared from holiday.

406
00:14:36,861 --> 00:14:38,900
A small town just out of Salt Lake City.

407
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,210
That so you could walk to
the store to buy some gum,

408
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,170
and she was last seen by an eye witness
getting into a light brown Volkswagen

409
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,750
bug tabs next to the 18th.

410
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:50,660
This time the victim was the
daughter of the Midvale police chief,

411
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:51,494
Louis Smith,

412
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,970
the third Utah victim with 17
year old Laura Amy from Lahey,

413
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,870
25 miles south of Salt Lake City.

414
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,180
It was October the 31st Halloween night.

415
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:02,030
Laura was a high school dropout who had
moved out of our higher minimum with our

416
00:15:02,031 --> 00:15:02,800
friends,

417
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,460
bought at the lack of action that night.

418
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,310
She had left a local cafe just often,

419
00:15:06,311 --> 00:15:08,540
midnights and proceeded
to walk to a local park.

420
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,830
She was never seen again.

421
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,060
Less than a month later,

422
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:15,200
ted abducted an 18 year old girl from
a local mall by impersonating a police

423
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:15,740
officer.

424
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,430
Fortunately,

425
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:20,000
she managed to break free from his call
moments after he had slapped handcuffs

426
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:20,990
on one of her wrists,

427
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,560
a frustrated Ted's drove for another
17 miles before coming to the humans

428
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,990
highschool where a school
production was in progress.

429
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,300
You have dr and killed 17 year olds.

430
00:15:29,301 --> 00:15:33,800
Debbie Katz in 1975 though 10 founders
and you killing zone Colorado.

431
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,400
It he murdered at least five
women during a six month period.

432
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,670
Burying best skulls in a bizarre
graveyard in the Taylor mountains

433
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,100
in the early morning hours of August,

434
00:15:45,101 --> 00:15:46,600
the 16th of 1975.

435
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,880
The police finally
caught up with Ted Bundy,

436
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,380
a minor traffic violation.

437
00:15:50,381 --> 00:15:51,560
They do a search of his car,

438
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,020
which produced a burglar's.

439
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:53,321
Kits,

440
00:15:53,321 --> 00:15:54,910
competes with handcuffs and rope.

441
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,240
The authorities were seeing able to
connect the dots and charges of aggravated

442
00:15:58,241 --> 00:16:00,550
kidnapping and criminal assaults
were brought against him.

443
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,660
He was found guilty and sentenced
to 1:15 years for the police.

444
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,800
This was just the stars.

445
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,190
They now set about building a case to
hold you accountable for the trail of

446
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:10,750
bodies that he'd left in his wake.

447
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,590
Dad was adamant that he
would defend himself in the
upcoming trial and was given

448
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,820
access to the Aspen Law Library to do
research during a visit to the law library

449
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,720
on June the 17th,

450
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,141
19,

451
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:21,050
76 months.

452
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,440
He managed to use the power
of a second story window.

453
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,240
He went straight for the local river bank.

454
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:28,630
He took off his courtroom outfits to
reveal a second set of clothes underneath.

455
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,410
He then brushed himself off and calmly
walks back to the center of town.

456
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,420
That was the police rushed
to set up roadblocks.

457
00:16:34,421 --> 00:16:36,550
He wiled away as time browsing in stores.

458
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:37,810
It was classic Bundy.

459
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,000
After a week on the rung,

460
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:39,850
he was recaptured.

461
00:16:39,851 --> 00:16:40,900
I need to break out again.

462
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,890
Six months later,

463
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,521
this time,

464
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:43,450
he was able to evade,

465
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:44,110
recapture,

466
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:45,250
and set out for Florida.

467
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,100
He set himself up in the vicinity
of Florida State University.

468
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,090
For over a year,

469
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,970
he managed to control his urges
until on the night of January,

470
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:52,541
the 14th,

471
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:52,871
19,

472
00:16:52,871 --> 00:16:53,590
78,

473
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:58,060
his demons were unleashed in an orgy of
violence that left to girl's dead and to

474
00:16:58,061 --> 00:16:58,241
mall,

475
00:16:58,241 --> 00:17:01,030
hardly decent at the Ci
Omega Sorority House.

476
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,410
Over the following weeks,

477
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:09,370
Tad continued his rampage killing a 14
year old girl and attempting to abduct

478
00:17:09,371 --> 00:17:10,390
another was the girl,

479
00:17:10,391 --> 00:17:14,350
the daughter of a police detective helps
police produce an identical picture and

480
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,990
is that along with a series
of mistakes on Ted's part,

481
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,510
led to his recapture
around February the 15th,

482
00:17:19,511 --> 00:17:19,841
19,

483
00:17:19,841 --> 00:17:20,674
78.

484
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,220
This time,

485
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,240
there would be no escape.

486
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:24,610
After a lengthy trial in
which he defended himself,

487
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:28,300
Ted Bundy was found guilty of murder
and sentenced to death and the electric

488
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:28,930
chap,

489
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:30,070
he spent a decade appealing.

490
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:33,130
The decision was finally
executed on January the 24th,

491
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:33,551
19,

492
00:17:33,551 --> 00:17:34,360
89.

493
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:34,990
By that time,

494
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,010
the bundy phenomenon grown with legion
of mainly female fans who would fall in

495
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:41,650
love with tess and wrote
passionate love letters to him.

496
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,630
It seems that they conveniently forgot,

497
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,900
but he was one of the most cold
hearted killers in history,

498
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,790
so I'm not going to ask
whether you enjoyed the video,

499
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:49,980
definitely of our darker ones,
