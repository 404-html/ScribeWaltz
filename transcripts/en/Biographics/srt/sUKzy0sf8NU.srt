1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,180
Bill cosby as a standup
comedian and accent,

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:06,500
they became an American icon and someone
who millions of people look to as a

3
00:00:06,501 --> 00:00:10,820
father figure and as a moral compass,
he would disappoint the entire world.

4
00:00:10,821 --> 00:00:12,140
When they began to learn this,

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:16,990
he was not at all the wonderful person
that he portrayed himself to be detailed

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,800
biographics we're going to talk about
the life, the Korea and the downfall.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:23,210
Bill Cosby.

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,073
Okay.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:35,880
Okay.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,691
What do you make calls to be?

11
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:40,980
Junior was born in Philadelphia in
1937 and he was one of four children.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,620
His mother and a Pearl
was a maid and his father,

13
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,620
William Henry Cosby senior was
that steward in the u s navy.

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,030
He was always the class clown and never
took his education very seriously.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,170
He had failed so many classes that he
decided to drop out of high school in the

16
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:58,920
10th grade in order to follow in his
father's footsteps and join the navy.

17
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,190
He eventually earned a GED
through a military program.

18
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,010
He went to Temple University
in Philadelphia, runs, uh,

19
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,210
an athletic scholarship to be on that
track and field team while in college.

20
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:13,380
She works part time as a bartender and
would enjoy entertaining as customers by

21
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,600
telling jokes and making witty comments.

22
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,500
His customers encouraged him to get into
stand up comedy so we began going to

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:22,350
east coast comedy clubs in Philadelphia,
in New York City.

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,340
People enjoy it as comedy is so much that
he was able to book tours to the major

25
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:27,450
cities around the country.

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,230
He dropped out of college when he was 20
years old in favor of trying to make a

27
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,640
career and stands up.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,780
He appeared in several TV series telling
us jokes and including the tonight show

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,720
in 1964 he married a
woman named Camille Hanks.

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,440
She was only 20 years old and in her
sophomore year of college at the time and

31
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:47,040
bill calls and he was 27 they met on a
blind date and didn't know each other

32
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,540
that well before they got married.

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,290
They went on to have five
children together during
his stand up routines cause

34
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,280
it'd be, would talk a lot about his kids
and how difficult it was being a father.

35
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:59,400
Most parents could relate to everything
he was saying and it was considered to

36
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,990
be clean,
wholesome comedy.

37
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,400
In 1965 bill Cosby it at a starring
role on the TV show I spike.

38
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,800
He became the first African American
to star in a network television show.

39
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,540
He was an inspiration to people everywhere
in the young black men particularly

40
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,520
looked up to him as a role model.
However,

41
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:19,170
Isi was seen almost as a one hit wonder
and Cosby was not given any more of

42
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:24,171
these dashing roles in the future since
he was so popular with parents and he

43
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:28,140
had experience raising kids of his own,
he turns one of his standup characters.

44
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,800
Fat Albert's into a cartoon series
geared towards young urban kids,

45
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,390
often making some money from his career.

46
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:37,290
He wins on to finish his bachelor's and
eventually receive a master's degree and

47
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,440
a phd in education from the
University of Massachusetts.

48
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:44,460
In the 1970s he used fat Albert's
as his thesis statements,

49
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:47,700
explaining all the ways you use
the cartoon to educate children.

50
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,840
He goes to all of this on his resume
for creating educational content for TV,

51
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:55,500
which helped him land to gigs on
future shows like picture pages,

52
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,260
the electric company,
and more deep down.

53
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,020
Bill calls me it not want to continue
making children's contents and he was

54
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,790
really only doing it for the paycheck.

55
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,540
He took a break from TV to come out with
comedy albums and they did extremely

56
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:12,160
well. He wants six grammy awards and he
was suddenly thrust into the limelight as

57
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,620
being one of the best standup comedians.

58
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,280
He would pride himself in writing clean
comedy that anyone could listen to and

59
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,970
he would often criticize other black
comedians like Eddie Murphy for using

60
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
obscenities

61
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,600
when he was 47 years old.

62
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:35,040
Bill Cosby start as a character named
Dr Cliff Huxtable in the Cosby Shire.

63
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,240
The Huxtables had five kids just like
bill Cosby and Israel wife Camille.

64
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,350
People assumed that this story was
parallel to who he was in real life.

65
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,520
It became so popular.

66
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:48,720
The TV ratings showed that half of
the country was tuning in to watch.

67
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,771
At that time back,

68
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:53,880
people were almost exclusively portrayed
negativity in the media America witness

69
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:57,660
criminal activity and controversial
protests from the black community.

70
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,960
This was the first show to portray and
the upper middle class black family,

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,831
both parents,

72
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:05,160
they were funny intelligence and
hardworking people who had an education.

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,240
A black American was finally being
seen in a positive light and it was so

74
00:04:09,241 --> 00:04:12,000
genuinely funny.
Even white people were watching.

75
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,440
It helps to bring society together and
help them understands that really we're

76
00:04:16,441 --> 00:04:20,850
all the same. Unbeknownst to the audience,
none of this was ever bill calls.

77
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:25,590
These idea the show was created by two
television producers named Marcy Casi and

78
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:26,543
Tom Water.

79
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,270
They wanted to come up with a concept
for a sitcom that no one had ever done

80
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:32,490
before and often seeing
bill Cosby stands up.

81
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:34,470
They approached him about doing a series.

82
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,190
Bill Cosby insisted that he would not
work for less than a million dollars a

83
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:41,160
year and the show needed to
have his name in the title.

84
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,980
He wanted to make this
TV show all about him,

85
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,000
even though the producers already knew
what they wanted to do with the series.

86
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,160
Bill Cosby tried to control the narrative.

87
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,880
He pitched the idea that the show should
be about a taxi driver who was tasked

88
00:04:53,881 --> 00:04:55,140
with taking care of the kids.

89
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,530
He wants it to be married to a Latino
woman and he feels he would be funny if

90
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:01,860
she worked a traditionally male
role like a carpenter or a plumber.

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,760
He chose a taxi driver for his character
because he wants it to be able to go on

92
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,600
monologues for the majority of episodes
in order to tell the jokes that he

93
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,640
normally tells in his stand up routines.

94
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:15,690
The produces pushed it back with Cosby
explaining that original vision for

95
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,060
portraying the new black American family.

96
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,710
They eventually convinced him to give it,

97
00:05:19,711 --> 00:05:23,690
to try and it exploded into a
cultural phenomena. However,

98
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,390
Bill Cosby received all of the praise
and recognition for all of the positive

99
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:29,250
changes that it made in society.

100
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:33,510
The show was filmed in New York City and
it attracted a lot of emerging African

101
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,680
American talent. People love to build
calls these character of cliff Huxtable,

102
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:40,050
and most people believe that he was
just playing an exaggerated version of

103
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:40,650
himself.

104
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,310
He was giving black people acting jobs
when they had never had the opportunity

105
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,000
to work in the industry before.

106
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,410
Is anything more than a
background character or an extra,

107
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,460
he would have a parade of women who had
come to audition to be on the Cosby show.

108
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:56,970
People who worked with him knew that
he was constantly cheating on his wife.

109
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,140
They assumed that these
relationships were consensual.

110
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,300
Ego would be seen speaking to Cosby.

111
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:05,870
She would get one or two lines on the
show and then she was never seen again,

112
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:10,730
but no one could have imagined how dark
the situation with bill Cosby actually

113
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:14,360
was and the doors were closed
and a lot of ways the Cosby show,

114
00:06:14,361 --> 00:06:18,620
Trudy did revolutionize the industry
and no matter who he wants as a person,

115
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,730
there is no denying that. He was also the
first African American to win an Emmy,

116
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,430
but for fans of the show,
he was America's Dat.

117
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,890
People idolized him and he knew it.

118
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,940
He wasn't afraid to take advantage of
people's trust and their respect to the

119
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,440
absolute fullest extent, even though the
vast majority of the show was fiction.

120
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,790
There were moments when bill
Cosby incorporated stories
from his real life into

121
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,450
the Cosby show. For example, there was
his relationship with his son, Ennis,

122
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:46,730
who was the parallel to
the character of Theo.

123
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:50,570
He grew up getting bad grades in school
and bill Cosby constantly called a son

124
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,240
Lazy and told him that he
wasn't trying hard enough.

125
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
It was like to reveal the
Ennis actually had dyslexia.

126
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,540
Once he was given a tutor to help
him cope with his disability,

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,290
he began to do much better in school and
went on to attend Columbia University

128
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,320
teacher's college hoping to become
a special education teacher.

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,990
Bill Cosby told the writers
of the show what it happens.

130
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,660
They used a parallel storyline
with the character of Theo,

131
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,640
the characters playing Cosby's children.

132
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,670
They all grew up and the show ended in
1992 in 1997 and this was on vacation in

133
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,530
Los Angeles, driving a Mercedes. His car.

134
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,130
He got a flat tire so he pulled over to
the side of the road in order to fix it

135
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,620
in a completely free active violence.

136
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:31,460
A young white man who was high on drugs
attempted to rob [inaudible] and it's

137
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:35,600
reached for his wallet, but the man shot
him in the head. When the Pavarotti,

138
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,930
you showed off her bill Cosby's house
asking for a comment about the death of

139
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:43,520
his, I mean the son, he quietly said
he was my hero and shut the door

140
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,360
often taking some time off to grieve.
Bill Cosby returned to show business.

141
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,240
He tried and failed to stop
more TV series as well.

142
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,630
He came back in the public eye
after his famous Jello commercials.

143
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,020
He was having financial trouble in the
shows were no longer doing well in the

144
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:07,340
ratings behind the scenes of the Jello
commercial c scolded parents and kicks

145
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:09,980
children off the set.
If they were not behaving well enough,

146
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,760
he would get into arguments with
business executives about how to sell the

147
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,460
product because he thought
he knew better than them.

148
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,150
He would often add lib instead
of following the actual
lines that had been given.

149
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,280
This body being so difficult to work with,

150
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:25,370
he was ending $3 million a
year doing just these ads.

151
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,830
Bill Cosby realized that the
image of a perfect father,

152
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,960
it was working and people loved it,

153
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,310
so he decided that he wanted the world
to believe that he truly was this great

154
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:34,940
person.

155
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,480
He gave college scholarships to African
American students and participated in

156
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:40,460
multiple charities and his name.
However they,

157
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,790
his true colors would come out on set
and whenever we went on lecture tours,

158
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:48,230
he spoke down to African Americans under
the guise of giving people tough love.

159
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,690
If his words were spoken
by a white person,

160
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,450
they would be considered
disgustingly racist.

161
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:57,990
He was always very degrading talking down
to other black people as if he was on

162
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:00,630
this pedestal of some
sort of moral high ground.

163
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,590
One of the most famous examples of
this is known as the poundcake speech.

164
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,910
During this speech given at the NAA CP
on the 50th anniversary of Brown and

165
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,390
board of education bellicose.

166
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,980
We blamed the black parents for their
children's poor behavior and he wants

167
00:09:13,981 --> 00:09:17,880
something 20 minute rants and lecturing
and talking down to African Americans

168
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,020
who were living in poverty.

169
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,350
He said that if it were not for
their laziness and irresponsibility,

170
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,610
then wise people would have more
respect for African Americans. He said,

171
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,570
we are not Africans.
Those people are not Africans.

172
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:34,650
They didn't know a damned thing about
Africa with names. Nick Shinika,

173
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,210
Shelia Guar Muhammad's and all that
crap and all of them are in jail.

174
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,040
It was so bad that in the transcripts,

175
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:45,330
the NACP how to add their own commentary
in parenthesis off to some of Cosby's

176
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,260
worst comments just so that people would
know that they disagree with a lot of

177
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,780
what he said.
Some people agreed with bill Cosby.

178
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,540
Ben's applauded him of the
schools in a race traitor.

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,310
In 2005 a sociologist and professor from
the University of Pennsylvania named

180
00:09:59,311 --> 00:10:03,060
Michael Eric Dyson wrote an
entire book in response called,

181
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,710
is bill Cosby right? Or has the
black middle class lost its mind.

182
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,840
Dyson breaks down points,
budding points,

183
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,470
just how wrong bill Cosby is
and how truly difficult it is.

184
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:16,080
African Americans do overcome racial bus,

185
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:19,260
white privileged and
socioeconomic disadvantages.

186
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,320
It was never a secret that bill
Cosby was cheating on his wife.

187
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,480
He was often gold,

188
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:32,820
a womanizer and openly admitted in
multiple lens of years that he had

189
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,180
girlfriends outside of his marriage
once in Ebony magazine. He said,

190
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,580
when you turn 40 you look at the enjoyment
you may get from a given activity and

191
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,730
then you look at the amount of work that
may have to go into it. For example,

192
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,820
sex with a young,
beautiful women who has plenty of energy.

193
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,730
A talented young actress named Lily
Bernard was mentoring under bill Cosby and

194
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:55,080
the hopes that she could
get to pot on the show.

195
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,010
She was zoned that he was taking
the time to teach her about acting.

196
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,850
He always told her that she was one of
his kids and she truly did see him as a

197
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:06,600
fellow, that she never has any intentions
of sleeping with him and believed that

198
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,610
everything was strictly professional.

199
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,300
She became friends with the other actors
on set and everyone believed that she

200
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:14,820
would eventually become a
new character on the show.

201
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,390
When Cosby thought she was ready,
she finally got the part in the TV show,

202
00:11:18,391 --> 00:11:22,260
which was a speaking role that's
only lasted for a few seconds,

203
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,550
often knowing her for a year,

204
00:11:23,551 --> 00:11:27,210
Bill Cosby convinced her to go to Atlantic
city with the promise that she would

205
00:11:27,211 --> 00:11:29,790
meet an agent who was going to
help with her acting career.

206
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,280
She had no reason not
to trust him after all,

207
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:36,660
she felt like bill Cosby was a dat when
the golf that he gave her a drink and

208
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,430
she blacked out. She woke up to him raping
her on the floor. It was so surreal.

209
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,900
She couldn't believe it was happening.

210
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,980
She was in denial hoping that it
was just a bad dream. My name was,

211
00:11:45,981 --> 00:11:49,680
I have Rhianna's. He see Sanken. She
told him that she would go to the police.

212
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,830
He threatened to sue half a defamation
and told her that she would go to,

213
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,830
he also threatened to completely ruin
her acting career. He's holds, Huh?

214
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,890
You're dead to me. Bernard.
You hemi. Your debt.

215
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,100
Lydia Bernard's was no longer allowed
on the side of the Cosby show.

216
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,010
Not only did she lose a
mentor and father figure,

217
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,190
but she also lost all of her friends
that she got to see every day.

218
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,920
The events was beyond traumatizing far.

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,170
She attempted to get a role
in a few other TV shows,

220
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:18,280
but eventually gave up on acting and
decided to become an artist even years

221
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:22,480
after the rape Lily Bernard's was afraid
to come forward because she truly did

222
00:12:22,481 --> 00:12:26,200
believe that he would make good on
the promise to sue her for defamation.

223
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,180
She was a struggling actress in New York.

224
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,970
You could not pay our rents and
let her learn, hire a lawyer.

225
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:34,180
She also knew that if the idea of
bill Cosby meant so much to her,

226
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:38,020
it would also crush the hopes and dreams
of African Americans across the country.

227
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,960
She also knew that no one would
believe her. Now is important.

228
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:45,700
We added this was just one of many stories
and we couldn't possibly go over all

229
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:49,810
of them in the short video and social
of 60 women came forward with similar

230
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,670
stories about bill Cosby.

231
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,420
Andrea comes down to is the first woman
to come forward and publicly accused him

232
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,490
of rape. They offered to
pay for her college degree,

233
00:12:57,491 --> 00:13:01,150
but she brought him to court instead.
Several journalists wrote about the case,

234
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:03,700
but many people brushed it
off as a false accusation.

235
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,300
People said that comes down to is just
trying to make money from bill Cosby him

236
00:13:07,301 --> 00:13:12,010
that he couldn't possibly be anything but
this perfect cliff Huxtable guide that

237
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,910
the kids over up with displaying to all
of the proof being out that the issue

238
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,020
was not reignited.

239
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:22,020
Again until 2014 a standup comedian named
Hannibal Buress was gaining a lot of

240
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:25,900
attention for his role in the
comedy central series, broad city.

241
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,150
During one of his standup shows,
he called out.

242
00:13:28,151 --> 00:13:31,270
Bill calls me saying that he had no right
to lecture black people on their bad

243
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:34,750
behavior when he himself is a rapist.
The story went viral.

244
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:39,730
Suddenly people knew and they actually
listened because it was another black man

245
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,670
confirming the truth.
Soon to she went public.

246
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:47,230
13 women approached Andrea constant to
say that they'd also been victims of rape

247
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,400
by bill Cosby. Soon after the comments
by Hannibal Buress when viral,

248
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,120
a reporter from the Associated
Press attempted to ask
him about the accusations.

249
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,550
During this interview,
we can see firsthand towel.

250
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,480
Bill Cosby uses intimidation to make the
reporter back down from revealing his

251
00:14:01,481 --> 00:14:03,220
comments on the rape accusations.

252
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,250
He tells the reporter that if he
wants to have a serious Korea,

253
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,100
he will not show the questions.
In that film.

254
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,370
He was seen as so powerful
that he was untouchable.

255
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,760
The spice. All of these accusations
coming forward in the media.

256
00:14:21,761 --> 00:14:26,170
People truly could not fathom that bill
Cosby was a rapist. Many of his friends,

257
00:14:26,171 --> 00:14:28,690
they came forward to defend them,
including Whoopi Goldberg.

258
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,350
She later recanted her statement.
The first trial had a hung jury.

259
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,440
They could not decide
if he was guilty or nos.

260
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:39,430
Prowls a supposed to be unbiased and
jurors and not supposed to learn too much

261
00:14:39,431 --> 00:14:41,710
about a defendant outside
of the court room,

262
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,860
but decades of seen cliff Huxtable
on the Cosby show on TV men's.

263
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:47,860
It was nearly impossible for people
to separate the tune of matter.

264
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:48,790
How hard they try it.

265
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,330
They just couldn't believe that this sweet
man capable of such a horrible thing.

266
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:55,610
Bill Cosby admitted
more than once that yes,

267
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:58,280
he gave quite alludes to women
in order to have sex with them,

268
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:00,410
but he didn't define that as rape.

269
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,080
He had actually admitted this
in interviews with magazines.

270
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:03,920
He is before all this,

271
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,950
I don't have to hearing him say this
so casually on the witness stand.

272
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,510
The jurors knew that he was truly guilty.
Even though 60 women have come forward,

273
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,730
only three brought their claims to court.

274
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:16,760
Keep in mind that this doesn't
mean the rest of the line.

275
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,540
It just means that they want to move on
with their lives and not have to retell

276
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:24,620
the stories of the worst moments in their
life and have that personal and family

277
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:26,150
lives exposed in the media.

278
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:30,740
In September of 2018 he was convicted
of aggravated indecent assault and was

279
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:34,220
sentenced to three to 10 years in prison.
At 81 years olds.

280
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:38,840
It's very likely that he will spend
the rest of his life behind bars,

281
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,420
so I already have you found that
video. Interesting. If you did,
