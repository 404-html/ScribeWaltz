1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,211
Or the age of seven,

2
00:00:01,211 --> 00:00:05,130
and Helen Keller was described by
family members as a little monster.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,510
She threw temper tantrums,

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,250
attacked,

5
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,940
meant a terrible personal habits.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,260
Yet within a year,

7
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:12,480
the deaf and blind girl
had been transformed.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,740
She became teachable.

9
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,360
That teaching on top to level of genius
and determination which saw her overcome

10
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:21,720
her disability and achieve
unimaginable success.

11
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,100
In this week's biographics,

12
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,190
we explore how Helen Keller
beat incredible odds to
become a true inspiration to

13
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,064
the world.

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,430
Helen Keller was born on June the 27th,

15
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:40,701
18,

16
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:41,720
80 in Tuscumbia,

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,500
a small town in northern Alabama.

18
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,810
She was a perfectly healthy baby with
the ability to see and hear how mother

19
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:51,800
Kate's just 23 years old was the pampered
southern Belle who doted on her first

20
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:52,460
child's.

21
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,293
Helen's father,

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,761
author,

23
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:53,991
Ray,

24
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,890
confederate veteran of the civil war
was 42 when his daughter was born.

25
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:02,030
Case was his second wife and he had
two grown sons from his first marriage.

26
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,570
The birth of Helen was a relief to
Katie and now had a child of our own to

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,680
shower love and attention.

28
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:10,640
Upon Alan was it quick developer speaking
her first words at six months and

29
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:12,520
taking her first steps on a fest birthday.

30
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,130
However,

31
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,100
in February 18,

32
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,130
82 at the age of 19 months,

33
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:20,330
she became severely ill with what
doctors at the time called brain fever.

34
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,170
Modern researchers believed that she
may have had scarlet fever or possibly

35
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:25,130
meningitis,

36
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:26,900
whatever the cause of her illness.

37
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,320
The local doctor was convinced
that the child would not survive.

38
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:35,760
Alan did survive,

39
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,860
but the illness have rubbed.

40
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:41,160
Our river herring and test site have
bright happy world was now filled with

41
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:45,060
silence and darkness as an adult Helen
records coming out of her illness.

42
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,290
I was too young to realize what happens
when I awoke and found that it was dark

43
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:53,580
and still I suppose I thought it was nice
and I must have wondered why David was

44
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:55,170
so long coming gradually,

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,740
however,

46
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,940
I got used to the silence and darkness
that surrounded me and forgot that it had

47
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:03,030
ever been day for the first
few months after her illness,

48
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,780
a terrified helen would do no more than
sit in their mother's lap and kings who

49
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:09,570
are dressed as kate tried
to do her daily chores.

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,760
Then she began to
venture out on their own,

51
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,580
first crawling around the room
and feeling her way forward.

52
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,130
She discovered that her
hands could in a small way,

53
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:21,690
do the job of our eyes helping her to
identify objects and different areas of

54
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:24,630
the house with Kate's patient assistance.

55
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,450
Helen also developed a crude
system of communication,

56
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,550
a shake of the head for
no one's and nod for yes,

57
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,670
I pull on her mother's
dress for come before long,

58
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,710
she had incorporated pantomime actions.

59
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:35,790
And do you have vocabulary?

60
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,200
If she wanted ice cream,

61
00:02:37,201 --> 00:02:39,900
she would pretend she was working
the freezer aisle while shivering.

62
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,471
However,

63
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:43,740
attentive mother would then rushed
to give her whatever she wants it.

64
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,930
Helen proved to be very determined.

65
00:02:45,931 --> 00:02:46,410
Child,

66
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,090
if she sets her mind on the task,

67
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,790
she would keep at this
until she wants successful.

68
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,480
At greatest desire was to improve our
ability to communicate with others,

69
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:57,660
making simple signs with our
hands was simply not enough.

70
00:02:57,661 --> 00:03:01,390
Perhaps the inability to people understand
what she was thinking and feeling led

71
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,530
to a level of frustration,

72
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,610
but wells deep insight up this lead
to violent outbursts of temper,

73
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:08,770
including screaming
fits and even violence.

74
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,603
Al bests.

75
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,930
Helen's temper tantrums.

76
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,130
They terrorize the family.

77
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,930
She would smash landon's thrust her fist
in plates of food and pinch whoever was

78
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:17,764
close by.

79
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:21,700
Relatives referred to the
child as a monster and
strongly urged and offer to put

80
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,870
her into an institution.

81
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,501
In 18,

82
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:24,150
85,

83
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,510
kate had a second child,

84
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,830
mildred baby sister for Helen with my
mother's doting attention now being

85
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:30,340
shared,

86
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,230
Helen became intensely jealous.

87
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,610
Ones she knocked over mildred's,

88
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,530
caught causing the baby to fall out.

89
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,470
Desperate case was an absolute wit's ends,

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,050
unable to control or help helen anymore.

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:41,710
However,

92
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,650
she remains determines
not to send her away.

93
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:45,890
When Helen was six,

94
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:47,440
I father learned of a doctor in Baltimore,

95
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,510
Maryland's named Julian Krystle.

96
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,550
He would help to restore
sight to blind people.

97
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,660
The family took the trip to consult with
Dr Chris on only to be told that there

98
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:59,140
was nothing medically that can
be done to fix helen's eyesight,

99
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,960
but the doctor did hold out a ray of hope.

100
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,340
He told the colors of autumn man,

101
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:06,790
who specialized in helping deaf
children to communicate his name.

102
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,070
It was Alexander Graham Bell,

103
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,040
although today he is best remembered
as the inventor of the telephone.

104
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:12,521
Bells.

105
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,470
Passion was actually helping the death.

106
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,550
Belle's mother and wife.

107
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,450
We're both death.

108
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:16,931
In fact,

109
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:17,591
he had met his wife,

110
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,030
Mabel when he had taken on the job.

111
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:22,330
Let's have private tutor teaching her
through a system of signing that he had

112
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,480
developed the Kellers.

113
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,140
It decided to travel to
Washington in order to meet him.

114
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,480
Helen felt comfortable
with belt right away,

115
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,500
but that first meeting,

116
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:31,120
he sat her on his knee and his handler,

117
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,983
his pocket watch.

118
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,380
She was delighted with the vibrations
that she felt when the watch struck.

119
00:04:35,381 --> 00:04:38,890
The our bell suggested the Kennedys
ranked to the Perkins Institute for the

120
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,440
Blind in Boston requesting
a tutor for Helen,

121
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,010
the institute that trains teachers so
you could go out and work with deaf and

122
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:45,844
blind students.

123
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,330
The director of the institute looked over
the list of recent graduates settling

124
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,470
upon his star pupil,

125
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,820
a 20 year old who was herself partially
blind from suffering Tacoma as a child.

126
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,620
Her name was Anne Sullivan

127
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,410
and Sullivan arrived at the
Keller House on March the third,

128
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:03,741
18,

129
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:04,460
87.

130
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,010
Helen's stood in the doorway
as she approached the child,

131
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,170
knew you from her mother's
scurried activities that morning,

132
00:05:09,171 --> 00:05:10,880
but something important was happening,

133
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:15,410
but she didn't yet know what the most
important day I remember in all my life is

134
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,650
the one in which my teacher and
Mansfield Sullivan came to me.

135
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,600
Helen could hear footsteps approaching,

136
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,830
assuming it was a mother.

137
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:26,000
She held her hand and took the girl's
hand and pulls her in for an embrace,

138
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,460
but when Helen realized
that this was a stranger,

139
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,050
she struggled to break free.

140
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,890
This was the first of many
temper outbursts that and
would be confronted with.

141
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,960
The very next day in a fit of rage,

142
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,780
the students knocked out one
of our teachers from Tif,

143
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,470
but Helen was quick to realize the
Miss Sullivan was not about to let the

144
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,260
petulant child get away
with outrageous behavior,

145
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,920
hasn't been happening up until then when
the breakfast table and hadn't reached

146
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,550
across to grab food from Anz plate that
she was accustomed to doing with family

147
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:55,130
members and grabs her
hands and pushed it away.

148
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,211
This scent Helen,

149
00:05:56,211 --> 00:06:00,320
into a fit of she flopped on the floor
and exhibits exhibitors a full on

150
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,160
Tantrum.

151
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,370
Sullivan asked the other family members
to leave the room and lock the door.

152
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,770
She then proceeded to
continue eating her breakfast,

153
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,080
completely ignoring Holland's performance.

154
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:09,621
Finally,

155
00:06:09,621 --> 00:06:13,910
the exasperated child got off the floor
and felt friend's body to see what she

156
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:14,510
was doing.

157
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,700
Why want you to discover that
and was commonly eating her food.

158
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:21,050
She again began to grab the plates at
each time and would slap her hand away.

159
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,380
Helen then began pinching ans hand
something that she was allowed to do with

160
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:26,510
impunity to our family members again,

161
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,070
and slap the hand away.

162
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:28,970
Finally,

163
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,280
hello.

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,590
Sat back on her chair and began eating
her food and she seen came to the

165
00:06:33,591 --> 00:06:37,070
realization that Helen's family
members had been enabling her behavior.

166
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,200
She knew that's made any progress.

167
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,080
She would have to separate
the child from her parents.

168
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,950
The kellers agreed to let Anne and Helen
lived in a small cottage not far from

169
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:49,700
the main house and wanted Helen to things
that they had traveled a long distance

170
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:50,450
from the family,

171
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,700
so the two of them set
out on a carriage ride.

172
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,640
This unknown to Helen
circled back to the cottage.

173
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,430
Helen wasn't happy to be packed
off with a strict new teacher.

174
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,820
She spent the first day screaming and
throwing things around the cottage that

175
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:05,160
night and have a hotel and down
for hours just to keep her in best.

176
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,920
The child's strength and determination.

177
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,000
They were incredible,

178
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:12,560
but I'm was just that little bit greater
as the days and weeks passed and was

179
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:14,660
able to slowly bring Helen under control.

180
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,170
The change began when Anne started
spelling out words on Helen's part.

181
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:20,150
The first word was doll.

182
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,780
The finger play in tree teller and
she proved to be an excellent minute.

183
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,490
Soon she was spelling out a dozen,

184
00:07:25,491 --> 00:07:27,140
three letter words with her fingers,

185
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,570
but she still didn't know what they met.

186
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,670
The breakthrough came on April the fifth,

187
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,180
18,

188
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:35,570
87 that morning and had been trying
to get out and do you understand the

189
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:36,890
differences between the words,

190
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,090
Mug and water.

191
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,400
She took her to the water pump,

192
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:39,550
pound,

193
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,383
sign the cottage,

194
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,900
and had the girl hold out a mug and then
work to the pump so the water filled it

195
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,190
and began to overflow.

196
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,060
She then began to spell the word
water on Helen's free hands.

197
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,500
Suddenly the light went off.

198
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,334
In Helen's mind,

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,670
she later wrote that living
world awakened my soul.

200
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,593
Give it light,

201
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,290
hope,

202
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:57,980
joy,

203
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,813
set it free.

204
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,260
Now she had a taste for word meanings.

205
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,610
She couldn't get enough.

206
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,010
She wanted to and to spell
out everything around her.

207
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:08,840
She managed add dozens of new words to
have vocabulary every single day as their

208
00:08:08,841 --> 00:08:10,250
understanding of the world group.

209
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:13,970
Alan's personality began to mellow and
the temper tantrums became less frequent.

210
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,780
She came to understand that people would
treat her with greater empathy if she

211
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:21,440
displayed a kind and caring
personality with the key to knowledge,

212
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,390
understanding words meaning now unlocked.

213
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:27,950
Helen was able to learn with amazing
speed in just a few short months.

214
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:32,000
She was reading books in Braille and was
no longer at spelling only simple words

215
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:32,990
onto Helen's pile.

216
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,470
Now she was signing portions of
Shakespeare and so the Bible,

217
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,940
by the time she was nine,

218
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,770
Helen was reading the works of such great
poets as Shelly longfellow and Oliver

219
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,730
Wendell Holmes.

220
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,380
This made her far more advanced in a
literary sense than most other children of

221
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,214
her age,

222
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,270
and quickly came to the realization that
Helen's ability to comprehend complex

223
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:55,070
ideas was highly advanced.

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,930
Writing a report to the director of
the Perkins School for the blind.

225
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,840
She spoke of vans near genius
level learning ability,

226
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,160
but she added the director must not show
the report to anyone else she didn't

227
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:07,110
want to add in to be
turned into a prodigy.

228
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,711
However,

229
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:12,480
the director Michael and saw Helen story
isn't opportunity for reflected glory.

230
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,810
He talks all the 56th annual
report of the Perkins School,

231
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:16,823
Helen Keller,

232
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,610
a second,

233
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:20,850
Laura Bridgeman in the reports
in embellished Helen story,

234
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,410
making it even more irresistible to the
press before long newspapers all over

235
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,070
the country.

236
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,710
We're writing gushing stories
about the child genius.

237
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:33,090
He was reading Shakespeare despite not
being able to see or hear Helen story

238
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,950
even reached across the Europe
where Queen Victoria was intrigued.

239
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,990
Do you hear of the brilliant little
deaf and blind girl by age 10?

240
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,470
Having color was an internationally
renowned figure when a policeman shot her

241
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,890
dog,

242
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,550
lioness.

243
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,140
The news was picked up in the papers.

244
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,110
Indeed people began sending
her money to buy another doc.

245
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,780
Helen was reported as saying
that she didn't need a new dog,

246
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,180
but she would like to use the
money to help a poor blind,

247
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,870
deaf and mute boy named Tommy Stringer
to attends the Perkins School for the

248
00:09:57,871 --> 00:09:58,530
blind.

249
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,290
The public responded and Tommy's
tuition fees were paid for.

250
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,450
This inspired Helen.

251
00:10:02,451 --> 00:10:03,720
He wants to help more children,

252
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,920
so she began writing letters to
people who are willing to donate money

253
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,610
by the time she was 10 years of age.

254
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,550
Helen had not spoken a
clear word in her life,

255
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,050
but then in March of 18,

256
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:17,590
90,

257
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:21,190
she heard about a deaf blind girl in
Norway who had learned to speak with our

258
00:10:21,191 --> 00:10:21,790
mouth.

259
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,480
Now she became obsessed with
doing the same thing and Sullivan,

260
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,150
new justice you could help out
and that would be Sarah Fuller,

261
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:31,150
the director of the school
for the deaf in Boston,

262
00:10:31,151 --> 00:10:33,910
Massachusetts Fuller decided
to teach helen herself.

263
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:37,690
She took a hold of Helen's hands and
placed it over her mouth to allow the girl

264
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:40,330
to feel the movement of our
lips and tongue as she spoke,

265
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,390
helen then copied the motions
without own speech organs.

266
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,330
After only an hour of intense
concentration and effort,

267
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,180
she was able to speak her first sentence.

268
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,920
It's too warm.

269
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,330
The sounds of Helen's voice,

270
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:52,840
however,

271
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:57,580
was almost impossible to understand how
untrained vocal chords would need a lot

272
00:10:57,581 --> 00:11:00,490
of practice before she was
able to make legible speech.

273
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,480
In later years,

274
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,840
she would train for three summers under
the guidance of a famous music teacher

275
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,800
in order to improve her
speaking voice back at Alabama.

276
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,200
I learned that and continue to
work on speech developments.

277
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,140
They also developed a method of
hearing what others were saying.

278
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,660
She would place a thumb on
the throat of the speaker,

279
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,900
her forefinger on their lips and
her middle finger on their notes.

280
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:23,420
This would allow her to translate
the vibrations into sounds

281
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,793
in November 18,

282
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,370
91,

283
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,970
11 year old helens and the birthday
presents and Michael and agnostic director

284
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:34,080
of the Perkins Institute.

285
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,710
It was a short story that she had
written on her Braille slate or the frost

286
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,340
king,

287
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:42,720
and I was impressed with the quality of
the pros and published the story and the

288
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,553
Perkins Alumini magazine.

289
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,050
Helen was overjoyed to
become a published author,

290
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,970
but the joy was short lived.

291
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:51,420
Reports reach Tuscumbia that there was
a book in Prince Goals of the frost.

292
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:55,210
Fairies by Margaret t can
be the story was uncannily.

293
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:56,650
Similar to Helen Story,

294
00:11:56,651 --> 00:12:00,460
the frost gang accusations started to
circulate that she had plagiarized the

295
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:01,150
story.

296
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,470
When this was explained to her,

297
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,370
she was horrified.

298
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,293
Reading can be.

299
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,370
She realized the
similarities were striking,

300
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,150
but she was adamant that she had
written her own original story.

301
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,940
The reality was that Helen
had become a voracious reader.

302
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:16,780
She would digest one book after another
with no thought who had written them.

303
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,580
Ideas became jumbled in her mind,

304
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,820
and she wasn't able to remember if they
came from yourself or from what she had

305
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:22,270
read,

306
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,550
so when she enthusiastically
produced a story,

307
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,350
she believed that the ideas own.

308
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,161
However,

309
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:30,970
a worker at the Parkinson's institute
had indeed read the frost ferries to her

310
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,230
for a year before the story simply became
lodged in her subconscious and it was

311
00:12:35,231 --> 00:12:37,330
clearly the inspiration
for the frost king.

312
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,790
The incident caused deep
embarrassment for Helen.

313
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,260
She wrote that down in a diary.

314
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,280
It made us feel so bad that people
thought we had been untrue and wicked.

315
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:49,660
My heart was full of tears for I love
the beautiful truth with my whole heart

316
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,583
and mind.

317
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,810
Michael and Agnes was also humiliated
by the incidents he had to print a

318
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:57,400
retraction to explain the
mixup off questioning.

319
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:57,730
Helen,

320
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,370
he believes that no deliberate
plagiarism was involved,

321
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,760
but then one of his teachers reported
to him that Helen had confessed the

322
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:04,600
wrongdoings or heart.

323
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,590
The truth was that this manipulative
teacher had twisted Helen's words to make

324
00:13:08,591 --> 00:13:09,550
us sound guilty.

325
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:10,420
It was enough,

326
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,990
however,

327
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,710
an agnostic turn against Helen and
his former star pupil and Sullivan.

328
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,670
He sets up a formal hearing in which
Helen was interrogated by an eight member

329
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:19,330
panel.

330
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:23,050
It was one of the most terrifying
experiences if the 11 year old's life.

331
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,760
After a day of tough scrutiny,

332
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,970
the panel was split down the middle as
to whether deliberate plagiarism was

333
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:32,260
involved in the ends and agnostics split
stalemates coming down on the side of

334
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:33,010
Helen.

335
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,830
The Frost King Experience Haunted
Helen for many years to come.

336
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,320
Whenever she wrote a
sentence from then onwards,

337
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,490
she would check it repeatedly to make
sure that it was our own original work.

338
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:47,390
In March 18,

339
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:51,760
93 and intelligent attended
the presidential inauguration
of grover Cleveland's.

340
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,621
From there,

341
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:55,520
they went to Niagara Falls
where Helen was astounded.

342
00:13:55,521 --> 00:14:00,050
It's and it's the power of the vibrations
caused by the massive pounding waters.

343
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,870
They then went on to Chicago
to attend the world's fat.

344
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,420
They were escorted by
Alexander Graham Bell,

345
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:07,880
who was featuring his telephone
at the great exhibition,

346
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:12,230
but the famous deaf blind gal who had
conquered her handicaps was just as much a

347
00:14:12,231 --> 00:14:14,360
draw card as the renowned in Venza,

348
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:17,180
the exhibition which featured
exhibits from all over the world,

349
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,083
frilled Helen.

350
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,510
She was the only one of
the millions of visitors.

351
00:14:20,511 --> 00:14:22,730
He was allowed to run her
hands over the exhibits.

352
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,810
This gave a a far greater appreciation
of the world around than anything she had

353
00:14:26,811 --> 00:14:29,750
read in books whetting our
appetite to learn more.

354
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,870
At the age of 16,

355
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,890
Helen began studying.

356
00:14:35,891 --> 00:14:38,200
It became bridge school for
young ladies in Cambridge,

357
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:39,034
Massachusetts.

358
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:43,060
She was now in class alongside and
competing with girls you could see in hip.

359
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,170
I'm Sullivan attended every class
alongside Helen interpreting the lessons.

360
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,290
Helen made rapid progress completing her
first year study with honors in German

361
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,730
and English in our second year.

362
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,180
However,

363
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,900
she struggled,

364
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,280
especially with mathematics.

365
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,820
The decision was made to withdraw her
from the school and provide her with a

366
00:14:58,821 --> 00:14:59,654
private tutor.

367
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,560
A year later,

368
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,260
she was ready to take the entrance
exam for Radcliffe College,

369
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,920
the Women's division of Harvard
University passing with distinction.

370
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,060
She became the first person with major
disabilities to enter an institute of

371
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:11,894
higher learning.

372
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,340
Helen found the pace at Radcliffe,

373
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:14,360
frantic again.

374
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,240
She had animal alongside how to
spell out the lessons on her fingers,

375
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,380
but even then she had difficulty
keeping pace with fast talking lecturers

376
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,900
despite the hurried pace.

377
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:23,793
How long did well,

378
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,810
especially in English during her
second year as a literacy teacher,

379
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,650
encouraged her to write her life story
so that the world could get an insight

380
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,420
into the struggles that
she had gone through.

381
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,700
Helen worked on the
manuscript while studying,

382
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,280
which also placed an
intolerable strain on her.

383
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,740
Finally in March of 19.

384
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:38,851
Oh,

385
00:15:38,851 --> 00:15:39,021
three,

386
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,640
the story of my life was published.

387
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,230
Sales were slow at first,

388
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:45,920
but it has gone on to become a beloved
classic and it was recognized by the New

389
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,420
York public library as one of the 100
most important books of the 20th century.

390
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,020
Indeed,

391
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,020
this was the first of 15 books
that she would go on to write.

392
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,990
Helen graduated from
Radcliffe on June the 28th,

393
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:57,411
Nineteen,

394
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:57,501
Oh,

395
00:15:57,501 --> 00:15:57,920
four.

396
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,000
To become the first person with a serious
disability to earn an undergraduate

397
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:02,720
degree.

398
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,230
She now found herself in
demand for speaking engagements
where people flocked to

399
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:08,860
hear her inspirational story in 19 Oh,

400
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:09,950
five and Sullivan,

401
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,110
Mary John Macy Helps Helen Publish,

402
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:13,160
have autobiography.

403
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,010
The three of them lived under the same
roof with Mason and Helen developing a

404
00:16:17,011 --> 00:16:18,140
very special bond.

405
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,810
Helen devoted the rest of her
life to helping the blinds.

406
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,940
She wrote extensively on the subject,

407
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,290
has worked tirelessly for a uniform
system of Braille along with them and

408
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,280
sometimes some other case.

409
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,750
She traveled internationally,

410
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:33,500
giving lectures and sold out halls
everywhere from Canada to Australia.

411
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,870
When he died in 1936,

412
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:40,550
former housemaid poly Thompson became
helen's constant companion during World

413
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:40,640
War Two.

414
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,420
Helen was a ray of hope for the thousands
of servicemen who were blinded or

415
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:45,470
deafened in combat.

416
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,180
During 1943 alone,

417
00:16:47,181 --> 00:16:51,800
she visited 70 army and naval hospitals
up and down the United States.

418
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,813
In her later years,

419
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:56,390
Helen was widely regarded as the
greatest living American woman.

420
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,770
In 1964,

421
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,890
she was awarded the Presidential
Medal of freedom for years later,

422
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,060
she suffered a heart attack.

423
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,890
She died on June the first 19,

424
00:17:03,891 --> 00:17:04,560
68,

425
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,840
but our home in Westport,

426
00:17:05,841 --> 00:17:06,674
Connecticut,

427

she was 87 years of age,

428
