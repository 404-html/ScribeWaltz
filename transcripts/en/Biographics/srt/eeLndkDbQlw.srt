coco Chanel either from her famous perfume

10

or the luxury clothing brands based on
our name as a woman trying to build a

11
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:41,010
business in a time where the
world was controlled by men.

12
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,150
Chanel started at less than zero.
Then you had,

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,910
she found a way to climb to the position
of being one of the most wealthy and

14
00:00:47,911 --> 00:00:51,860
powerful women in the world
on today is biographics.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,760
We're here to tell you the true
rags to riches story of Coco Chanel.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,820
Gabrielle Chanel was born on August
the 19th 1883 and Francis La Valley.

17
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,790
Her mother, usually Sean Deval
was an unwed laundry woman.

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,840
She gave birth to Gabrielle in a charity
hospital run by nuns on the day she was

19
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:19,200
born. Her mother had to ride traveling
where the father's name should be.

20
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,830
That wasn't just an excuse for an absentee
dad though because Albert's Chanel

21
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:25,740
traveled from towns down selling
clothes to local peasants.

22
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,050
Gabrielle has one oldest sister, Julia,
and they were less than a year apart.

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,820
The couple had their hands full with two
infant daughters and they could hardly

24
00:01:32,821 --> 00:01:37,080
scraped by with what little money they
hat in 1884 Elvis and Joel's family gave

25
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,660
them money so that they could
pay for a marriage license.

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,280
Off to that union was official.

27
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:44,490
They had several more children and the
family all lived in a cramped one room

28
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:48,470
apartments in the town of Breve.
Like our day, Gabrielle Learns Outer,

29
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,990
so at an early age to help her
father with his clothing business,

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:55,830
but when she was just 12 years old,
Gabrielle's mother came sick and died.

31
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:58,520
Raising young children is
very much a full time job.

32
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,430
He could not earn an income and
take care of them at the same time.

33
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:05,580
He sent his sons to work on a farm and
the girls were sent to a convent to be

34
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:09,690
raised by nuns. The nuns
taught her discipline as well
is how to read and write.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,680
She lands a carry herself with the grace
and the elegance of a lady rather than

36
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:17,090
a peasant. Most of the other children
living in the convent, they were orphans,

37
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:18,870
but since her father was still alive,

38
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:21,180
Gabrielle refuse to consider
herself an orphan too.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
She held onto the hope that her father
would return one day and that they could

40
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:27,270
be a family again.
At this time in our life,

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,170
books acted as a way for her to get lost.
In a world of fantasy.

42
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,310
She began to create elaborate stories
about her own life as well to help ease

43
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:37,590
the pain of her reality laser in life.

44
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:41,040
One of the most common stories she told
her friends was how she was raised by

45
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,270
Hystrix aunties.

46
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:46,440
She continued to tell lies and
half truths about our past,

47
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,750
which made it almost
impossible for anyone to know.

48
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,750
Just how difficult her
childhood Trudy had been.

49
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,430
That's Age 18 Gabrielle,
the convent to find a job.

50
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,830
There are very few opportunities
for women to find work,

51
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:06,220
but she was lucky to have sewing skills
that should have learned from our father.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,080
She won't as a seamstress during the day,

53
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:11,050
making clothing for the rich
ladies in the town of Milan.

54
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,920
This was a very solitary job
ans she was his in a backroom,

55
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,640
working long hours,
mending and assembling garments at night.

56
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:22,180
She worked a second job as a nice club
where she would sing and dance in front

57
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:22,870
of a crowd.

58
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,760
When she was 23 I actually caught the
attention of a man named Etienne Belle's

59
00:03:26,761 --> 00:03:29,680
song. He was the ad, so the
wealthy Bellstone gamant company,

60
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:31,840
which supplied the French
army with its uniforms.

61
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,300
Gabrielle Chanel's started going
by the nickname coco. Yes. Later,

62
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:39,430
or even Chanel herself would
tell a different story of
where the name came from.

63
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,640
Somebody that was based on the
lyrics of a song she used to sing.

64
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,070
Others think it's short
for the French Coco,

65
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,880
which means a kept woman or in
today's slang, a sugar baby.

66
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,190
For someone in Gabrielle
Chanel's situation.

67
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:54,760
These wealthy men were the only
hope she had of escaping poverty.

68
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,080
Balsam had a type which was
aspiring actresses, the girlfriends.

69
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,830
He lived with him before Chanel
was named Emily Oh, dialing codes.

70
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,340
She went on to become rich and famous
with a successful career in Paris.

71
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,910
Gabrielle has no delusions about the
relationship that she had with and

72
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,690
[inaudible] and she knew that by sleeping
with him he could introduce her to the

73
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:15,820
right people. This
officer, a few auditions,

74
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:19,460
it was clear that she just wasn't cut
out for Shay business. She was staying.

75
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:21,130
It's Bell Saul's house in the country.

76
00:04:21,131 --> 00:04:25,630
The Chateau de Roy low for a few days
don't was sets in the middle of the forest

77
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,330
where but also enjoy
riding horses and hunting.

78
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,510
When his guests came over the weekend,

79
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:34,870
he kept like his dirty little secrets
telling her it's 101 of the back bedrooms.

80
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,940
This was infuriating for Chanel.

81
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,010
It was clear that about someone
was willing to sleep with her,

82
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:41,320
but he was ashamed to be
seen with our in public.

83
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,340
Plenty of people would feel completely
dejected by this whole situation,

84
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:49,060
but instead of feeling defeated,
this sparked a fire in her.

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,750
She wanted to prove that she
was worthy of being this party.

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,420
The only problem was that the clothes,

87
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,460
she arrived in majors and now
they're on vias that she was Paul.

88
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,040
So she took one of ball
salts suits and cut it apart,

89
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:02,170
tailoring it to fit her body perfectly.

90
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:04,450
Then she showed up to
the party on invited.

91
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,350
She heard herself with confidence while
everyone's heads turned to to see this

92
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,630
beautiful woman standing
in a mountain suit.

93
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,760
When the guests asked why
she was dressed like that,

94
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:15,580
she casually said that it was
far more comfortable. Remember,

95
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,000
this happened in the year 1906 so
this was completely unheard of.

96
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:23,860
Women wearing corsets, long gloves, and
multiple layers of Scott's at this party.

97
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,370
Chanel was clever and it's interesting to
talk to you. When she made new friends,

98
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:29,830
she would make up elaborate
stories about her past,

99
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,040
just like she had done as a young bill.
She wants to add my life,

100
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,130
didn't please me.
So I created my life.

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,100
Basile was impressed by this stuff,

102
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:40,820
so he allows her to continue
living at his chateau [inaudible].

103
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,670
She joined is in a secular friends.

104
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,160
He began to treat her to
new clothes and jewelry,

105
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:47,710
but she continued to use
the fabric from Belle songs,

106
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:50,500
discarded clothing to make
herself outfits to wear instead.

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,940
For most women nodding,

108
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:55,570
there's a fabric feathers and Jules was
a way to show off that they were married

109
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,740
to someone who had a lot of money,

110
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,100
thought these things were rather vulgar
and she doesn't care if a simple style

111
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,370
may to look poor. She just wanted
to be comfortable. Soon enough,

112
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:08,510
other women began to copy cocoa style.
Looking at photos of Chanel and our youth,

113
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:12,920
it's almost as if they were taken today
or like if she was a time traveler sent

114
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:16,040
back a hundred years. He has an
idea. She was quoted as saying,

115
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:20,510
in order to be irreplaceable, one must
be different during World War One,

116
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,170
when everywhere began to wet pants because
they had to work while their husbands

117
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,360
were away,
but by the time the men married,

118
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,970
they wanted their wives to
go back to wearing dresses.

119
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,870
Of course women in the Aba class never
got to work a tool so they never stopped

120
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:36,050
wearing their core sets and the
layers of uncomfortable fabric.

121
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,820
If Coco Chanel was going to convince them
to change, it would happen in stages.

122
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,250
And over a very long period of time

123
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,740
when she was 26 years old,
Gabrielle mess,

124
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,830
an English businessmen named
off a capitalist, one of
FTO and bell souls potties,

125
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,610
everyone calls him by because he was
the illegitimate son of an aristocrat.

126
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,060
He worked his way up in the world to
become a self made man out of everyone in

127
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:04,290
Belle songs in a cycle.

128
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,710
He was one of the only people
who actually worked for a living.

129
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:12,240
Chenelle was not satisfied to sit around
and do nothing all day like other kept

130
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:12,600
women.

131
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,320
She was earning an income from selling
custom made hats to women who had moto

132
00:07:16,321 --> 00:07:20,640
style. This, she got the money in cash at
the time, women could not own businesses,

133
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,790
rented apartment, so even have
bank accounts without a guarantor,

134
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,460
which was usually the
father or the husbands.

135
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,200
All the capital would see that Gabrielle
Chanel was a genius and he believed in

136
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:32,790
her long before anyone else did.

137
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,720
He encouraged us to open a shop and
see helps out by putting his name on

138
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,350
everything.

139
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,620
Gabrielle ran the business entirely
on her own and began hiring women's.

140
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:41,580
You increased production.

141
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,300
Boy and Coco were the perfect path because
they were both passionate about each

142
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,720
of that respective businesses and
had a mutual respect for one another.

143
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:52,650
All the capital used his experience to
help look over contracts and negotiate

144
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:55,250
the business deals,
but the rest was all on her.

145
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:59,730
Even before opening how fast sharp Chanel
already has loyal can tell from Paris.

146
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,020
It became successful right out of the
gates and she began seeing profits almost

147
00:08:04,021 --> 00:08:06,030
immediately.
Boyan Coco use the money.

148
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:09,780
It's about just a lavish townhouse in
Paris which doubled as a fashion studio.

149
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,860
The whole of the ground floor was an
open space filled with a workshop.

150
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:17,520
She created jobs for women in the local
area and just staff was growing all the

151
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:21,000
time upstairs. She kept in a Polman's
and whenever capitol was in Paris,

152
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,420
he lived with her there.
Then.

153
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,820
Then that's what she did to prove how
success Coco Chanel could never be seen as

154
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:29,580
the marrying type in the
eyes of the aristocracy.

155
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,330
As a member of a noble family off the
capital was expected to end as a fan.

156
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:35,280
Erin's marry someone with a title.

157
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:40,290
In 1918 he had an English woman named
Diana Windom who was a widow and related

158
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:44,040
to and assortments of ELLs and Dukes,
but he and Chanel,

159
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:47,580
they was still very much in love and
it's continued that relationship behind

160
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:51,330
closed doors. On the 22nd of
December, 1919 off the capital,

161
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:54,510
died in a car crash on his way
to spend the holidays with Coco.

162
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,460
His was on Christmas Eve.

163
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:00,420
They were together for nine years and
Chanel plans you live out the rest of her

164
00:09:00,421 --> 00:09:01,200
life with him.

165
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,010
She was just 35 years old when he died
off the capital of being the love of her

166
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:09,410
life and no other man ever came
close to replacing him. Years later,

167
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,450
her name would be known around the
world and those same hours to craft.

168
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:17,010
So you refuse to accept a,
we'd be fighting to where,
how designs they came up,

169
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:18,000
points in her life.

170
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:21,840
When has celebrity catapulted her to a
place where she could have married anyone.

171
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:26,100
She wants it but she never did the one
man she wants it to be a husband was gone

172
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:27,870
forever.
He knew her before,

173
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:31,830
during and after a success and
there was no way to replace that.

174
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:36,780
But she had a resilience that helps her
to keep going no matter what she said.

175
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,070
When you're feeling sad, add bold
lipstick and attack. Okay. Okay.

176
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:44,520
So just before we get into
the fashion and war and Nazis,

177
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:47,880
let me take a moment to tell you about
Squarespace who make videos like this.

178
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:52,470
Pulsatile Squarespace empowers dreamers
makers and do is it gives them tools to

179
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:55,710
bring their creative ideas to life.
Squarespace also makes this very easy.

180
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,860
They've got this all in one platform.
So you can just claim a domain,

181
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,850
build a website, and even if you
want to, you can sound online.

182
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:06,450
There's no fussing around with getting
a domain from, you know, one website,

183
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:07,261
buying that,

184
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:11,010
transferring it over to Squarespace and
then working out how to sell something

185
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,840
or whatever. It's all neat and tidy
on Squarespace all in one place.

186
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,770
Very nice. Plus it's not going to look
too shabby either and by not too shabby,

187
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:22,500
I mean it's going to look fantastic.
They've got award winning templates,

188
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:23,700
a perfect starting points.

189
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,820
Then what you do is you customize
them to your heart's content,

190
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,860
much like Coco Chanel and those suits
plus this 24 seven customer support,

191
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,610
chat and email, and they've got loads
of accessible and is not confusing.

192
00:10:35,611 --> 00:10:39,780
Documentation on how to make your website
plus email marketing and I was to keep

193
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:43,770

And let's get back to Coco Chanel

199
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:10,670
off to the unexpected death of her beloved
boy Coco Chanel need to define a new

200
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,360
business partner. At that time,
she had over 300 employees.

201
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,380
She was designing couture dresses that
were selling for over 3000 francs each.

202
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:22,340
In today's money that's
more like $38,000 per dress.

203
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,800
She had an entire army of
women making these things.

204
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,500
You would think that this should have
proven that she was more than capable of

205
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:30,830
running a successful business best?
Well, no, she was still a woman,

206
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:32,810
so the banks refused to
deal directly with hub.

207
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,230
It would become impossible for her to
run a business on cash alone and it was

208
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:39,440
completely necessary for how to
seek help from a new male partner.

209
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,600
The law banning women from
opening bank accounts.

210
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,630
It would not change until 1965 after
the passing of the French family law.

211
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,490
This is when she met Pierre the Timia.

212
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,570
He had a reputation for working together
with other luxury brands around Paris

213
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,270
and the offer to become
her business partner.

214
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,100
The only issue was that
Chanel knew nothing about
nor or business contracts off

215
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,550
the capital is always had
a best interest at heart,

216
00:12:02,551 --> 00:12:05,620
and he gave us the freedom to run her
business as she pleased and keep the

217
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:06,760
profits for herself.

218
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,460
So she was too trusting and
she unwittingly signed a
contract that said Pfs II

219
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:13,720
ma was entitled to take 90%
of our business profits.

220
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,910
Even though this contract,
it was ridiculously unfair,

221
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,410
is meant that Chanel could stay in
business and she did not let this setback.

222
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,540
You've got the best of that.

223
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:26,620
In 1921 Chanel began working with the
celebrity puffy and chemist named Ernest

224
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:31,030
burrow. At the time, women were wearing
oils that had a single floral scent.

225
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,390
She wants us to create a perfume with
the layers which developed over time.

226
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,870
This is when they created Chanel number
five and it became one of the best

227
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,990
selling perfumes in the
weld for years to come.

228
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,070
Perfume and candle makers would copy the
idea of mixing various sense together

229
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:47,840
to create a unique experience.
Before Chanel.

230
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,510
Women never wore black unless they
were in mourning in the 1920s vogue

231
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,270
competitor, iconic little
black dress to Ford's model t.

232
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:58,410
It was simple elegance and revolutionary.
Soon enough,

233
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,030
people around the world what?
Looking to Chanel for inspiration.

234
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,780
It was a ripple effect and women's
clothing in the rest of the wells without

235
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:08,470
Coco Chanel. There's no telling what
kinds of clothes women would be wearing.

236
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,530
Today is data. It should now
reflect it. On that time saying,

237
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,480
I gave women a sense of freedom.

238
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,960
I gave them back their bodies
bodies that were drenched in sweat.

239
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,040
She had a fashions finery, lace
courses, underclothes padding,

240
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,570
despite the fact that she swore off,

241
00:13:22,571 --> 00:13:25,450
have a marrying Chanel continued
to be in relationships with men,

242
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,490
but then that's how
powerful they may have been.

243
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,810
She always stayed true to herself. If
she dated Grand Duke, Dimitri Pavlovich,

244
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,380
who was related to the Russian
Remann Hall family. Next was Edward,

245
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,680
the eighth Prince of Wales and before
the dawn of world war two she began a

246
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,580
relationship with a German man named
Barron Hans Gunther von Dinklage.

247
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,170
Looking at a track record,

248
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:47,830
it would seem that she had a personal
goal of trying to see if she could date at

249
00:13:47,831 --> 00:13:50,770
least one iris to crash from
every country in Europe,

250
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,930
but not decision to be in
a relationship with Vaughn.

251
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:56,920
Dinklage would become both a blessing
and to cuss. Just a few years later,

252
00:13:56,921 --> 00:13:57,491
the Nancy bought,

253
00:13:57,491 --> 00:14:01,480
he would rise to power and Chanel's
lover would reveal his true colors.

254
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,250
By the 1930s business was absolutely
booming as they needed all the space they

255
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:13,900
could guess and the house of Chanel,

256
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,380
how role female stuff increased in numbers
and it became necessary for Chanel to

257
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,810
move out of the studio
and into the Hotel Ritz,

258
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:22,310
which was directly across the
street from our business. Hey,

259
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,990
1936 there was a labor movement in
France and workers were demanding better

260
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:27,250
conditions across the country.

261
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,330
On the 26th of April or
Coco Chanel arrives at our
studio to see that all of our

262
00:14:31,331 --> 00:14:33,580
employees were sitting
on the floor and protest.

263
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,450
They all refuse to work unless their
wages were increased and their work hours

264
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:38,230
were lessons.

265
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,950
Chanel was outraged because she already
paid these women higher wages and gave

266
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,470
more vacation time than
any of the business.

267
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,000
Instead of giving into their demands,

268
00:14:46,001 --> 00:14:50,620
she fired every single one of them on the
spot saying that they were in grateful

269
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:55,160
and that she could do the walk on our
own, but they refuse to move. Finally,

270
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:58,520
she gave in to their demands for the
sake of getting on with the work. Now,

271
00:14:58,521 --> 00:15:02,330
in 1939 Germany had occupied Poland's
and Chanel knew that it was only a matter

272
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:04,760
of time before they were coming
for France. It's possible.

273
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:08,630
That's how boyfriends vom Dinklage lesson
knew that the takeover was imminent.

274
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,230
She paid off all 300 of our workers
and encourage them to seek safety.

275
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:14,240
Before it was too late.
Coco Chanel,

276
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,490
she was not going to need that
business though the metal.

277
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,700
What happens just three months later,
Germany occupied France,

278
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,360
the Nazis destroyed the businesses and
the homes of countless numbers of French

279
00:15:23,361 --> 00:15:26,480
people. The Nazis even took over.
The hotel. Ritz is the headquarters,

280
00:15:26,481 --> 00:15:29,930
so Chanelle very literally how to live
among them. How Homans our business.

281
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:33,710
We're both safe. So long as she continued
that relationship with Vaughn Dinklage,

282
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,840
but knowing Chanel,
she would have hated this.

283
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,720
She never wanted to be beholden
to any men. That's a learned,

284
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:41,180
the ones who thought they
could rule the world.

285
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,330
The Nazis knew that she was close
friends with the British royal family,

286
00:15:44,331 --> 00:15:46,850
so they asked if she would become
one with that secret agents.

287
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:51,390
In 1943 she was given the code name
model hat on a trip with Vaughn Dinklage.

288
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,160
She met with Winston Churchill and
handed him a letter which gave Geminis

289
00:15:55,161 --> 00:15:56,690
demands for England's surrender.

290
00:15:56,780 --> 00:16:00,320
Obviously he didn't take the offer and
it wouldn't be surprising if he crumpled

291
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:01,610
up the paper where he stood.

292
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,000
There is no way of knowing what was
said between Churchill and Chanel,

293
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,350
which she actually double agent divulging
Nazi secrets. We will never know,

294
00:16:09,351 --> 00:16:10,720
but when the war was over,

295
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:14,030
Chanel was never brought to trial
for cooperating with the Nazis.

296
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,900
She didn't have a spoke about that time
and buried deep like she did with all of

297
00:16:17,901 --> 00:16:20,090
the other unpleasant
memories and her life.

298
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,090
Coco Chanel ever said anything publicly.
There was antisemetic.

299
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,570
The Yoni documented issues she ever
had was with Pierre [inaudible],

300
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:29,690
who just so happens to be Jewish.
Often the Nazis occupied France.

301
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:32,120
They were seizing any property
that belonged to the Jews,

302
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,080
and that included businesses.
She wrote in that to,

303
00:16:34,081 --> 00:16:37,370
to the Nazi government asking if there
was a chance that she could buy back the

304
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,800
remaining 90% of house Chanel.
However,

305
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:43,430
the family temporarily sold their business
entities to Christians during the war,

306
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:45,050
and that already fled to safety.

307
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,220
They're all plenty of people who cannot
forgive Coco Chanel for cooperating with

308
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:53,750
the Nazis. But for a moment,
just put yourself in her
shoes. She had two choices.

309
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,100
Break up with her boyfriends,

310
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,720
condemn the Nazis and lose everything
well bite tongue and keep on pretending

311
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,620
for the benefits of maintaining the life
that she had worked so hard to build.

312
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:07,250
She chose a life and if
she were alive today,

313
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,150
she probably wouldn't even bother to
explain how decisions in her own words.

314
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:14,030
I don't care what you think
of me and I think about you.

315
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,200
I've told when the war was over in 1945
Chanel dumped from Dinklage quicker than

316
00:17:18,201 --> 00:17:19,540
you can say,
Oh Fida Zane.

317
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,660
She then moved on to having an effect
with a Spanish artist, Salvador Dali,

318
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:26,390
which is an interesting
choice to say the least.

319
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,373
Yeah.

320
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:37,020
When the war was over in 1945 Coco
Chanel was 62 years old and she no longer

321
00:17:37,021 --> 00:17:38,970
felt inspired to create new clothes.

322
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,870
She chose to retire from the fashion world
for years and lived off the royalties

323
00:17:42,871 --> 00:17:44,280
from the sales of her perfume.

324
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:49,430
In 1958 she found her second wind at the
age of 75 she unveiled new designs and

325
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,790
reopens House Chanel. This sponsor
resurgence in the brand's popularity,

326
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:54,810
Coco Chanel trays,

327
00:17:54,811 --> 00:17:57,930
a man named Karl Lagerfeld's to
be his successor for the brands.

328
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,900
She had more than enough money to
retire and live a comfortable life,

329
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:05,880
but she worked until the day she died
on January the 10th 1971 when she died,

330
00:18:05,881 --> 00:18:10,680
she was 87 years old and touch an
estimated net worth of $100 million.

331
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,920
Now, this might sound like a lots of
money, but do keep in mind the Pfs, him,

332
00:18:13,921 --> 00:18:18,330
his grandsons still own 90% of
Chanel even to this very day.

333
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,640
Then Alan,
multibillion as today,

334
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:24,960
many people think of Chanel as a brands
that is intimidating and unattainable,

335
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,880
but for those who look at the price tag,

336
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:30,960
they missed the point Coco Chanel was
quoted saying on more than one occasion

337
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:34,080
that she believed people should wear.
What makes them happy?

338
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,850
What are the colors you feel great
in and the style that makes you feel

339
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:41,460
comfortable instead of trying to
be flashy or to follow a trend,

340
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,050
your attitude and the way
you carry yourself speaks
far more than the clothes on

341
00:18:46,051 --> 00:18:49,620
your back. She said, fashion is not
something that exists in dresses.

342
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:52,770
Only fashion is in the sky,
in the street.

343
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,420
Fashion has to do with ideas the way
we live and what is happening. Now,

344
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,380
before we end today's video,

345
00:18:58,381 --> 00:19:02,280
I just want to say that our audience on
biographic says I need about 10% female

346
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,190
and we often look at these analytics
when we decided what videos to make.

347
00:19:05,191 --> 00:19:07,800
If you're a woman in the audience,

348
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:08,760
So we know you're out there.

349
