1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,300
Here's the 21st century,
how would Hughes,

2
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,530
John D Rockefeller and Steve Jobs
all rolled into one dynamic package.

3
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,040
His hunger for global change mirrors
the sense of adventure of the great

4
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:15,041
explorers of the past is ideas considered
crazy by everyone around him have

5
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:19,520
opens up a new frontiers as he continues
to improve the welds with the aid of

6
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:20,960
technological advancement.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,040
His goal to make the earth a better place
to live on has expanded to encompass

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,540
the entire universe,

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,100
including the possibility of supporting
human life on Mars and this episode of

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,760
Biographics,

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,300
we get up close and personal with the
man who was the model for Marvel's iron

12
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:38,900
man movie franchise character Tony Stark.
Of course,

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,900
the man we're talking about
and must be Elon Musk.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,410
They little mosque was born on June the
28th of 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa.

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,580
His Canadian born mother was a dietician
with his father being a mechanical and

16
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:07,540
electrical engineer.

17
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,110
The boy has a natural leaning towards
technology buying his first computer,

18
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:14,950
a commodore Vic 20 with money.
He had saved 20 it was just 10 years old.

19
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,310
By the age of 12 he had created
his own video game blaster,

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,370
which he sold for $500 as a preteen,

21
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:23,410
had already taught himself
computer programming.

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,010
Musk's life came to a crossroads in
his late teens when he was faced with

23
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:29,590
compulsory military
service in South Africa.

24
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:32,950
While he had no problem with the thought
of serving his country in uniform,

25
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,730
he was repulsed by the idea of being
a part of a system that suppressed the

26
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,560
country's indigenous black people.

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,620
His desire was to get to
America the land of opportunity,

28
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,610
especially in regards to his growing
fascination with all things related to

29
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:47,710
computer technology to do so.
However,

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,010
he figured he would have to use Canada
as a stepping stone. His mother,

31
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:55,510
it was still a Canadian citizen and so
steps were taken for Elon to acquire

32
00:01:55,511 --> 00:01:57,460
Canadian citizenship for himself.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,633
Yeah.

34
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,530
After graduating from Pretoria boys high
school and the emigrated to Canada in

35
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:16,000
June of 1989 age just 17
he had hardly any money,

36
00:02:16,001 --> 00:02:19,960
men's new real connections turning up
on the doorsteps of distant relatives of

37
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,270
his mother and to being
put to work on their farm,

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:25,780
as well as tending vegetables
and shoveling grain. He
got a job at a lumber mill,

39
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:29,560
cleaning out boilers. Then he managed
to secure a job as an intern, Clark.

40
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:32,860
It's a local bank. In 1990 he
moved to Kingston, Ontario,

41
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:36,400
where he began the science degree at
the Queen's University. Two years later,

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,370
he was able to achieve his goal
of living in the United States,

43
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,760
transferring his studies to
the University of Pennsylvania.

44
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,290
Within that two more years,

45
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:47,500
he graduated with double
degrees in science and business.

46
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,160
It was around this time that must came
across a copy of Douglas Adams, his book,

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,750
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

48
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,290
The book revolves around a supercomputer
which is built to figure out the

49
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,870
ultimate answer to the question of life,
the universe,

50
00:02:58,871 --> 00:03:03,460
and after 7.5 million years of computing,
it spits out the onset,

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,690
the number 42 along with that onset,
the computer which can talk,

52
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,280
add some sage advice telling the inquirer.
The problem with you,

53
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,490
to be quite honest with you is that you
never really know what the question is

54
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,430
for mosque reading.
That was a light bulb moment.

55
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,400
He later recalled is highlighters
and important points,

56
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,030
which is that a lot of times the
question is harder than the answer.

57
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,430
Why the time he emerged from university.

58
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,040
MUSC wasn't entirely sure
what the questions were,

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:34,690
but he knew that they were tied up
in three key areas. The Internet,

60
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,060
clean energy,
and the outer space.

61
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,120
In 1995 MUSC enrolled himself in a phd
program for Energy Physics at Stanford

62
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,130
University. Yes. After an
attendance of just two days,

63
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,400
he decided to drop out in order
to launch his first business.

64
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,200
His love for physics.
It never wavered,

65
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,170
but he saw greater opportunities in
the burgeoning internet revolution or

66
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,980
waiting to make society
better and himself rich shot.

67
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,153
Okay.

68
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,120
Mosque realized that as more and more
companies established an online presence,

69
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,080
they would need to have that
printed materials converted
into digital documents.

70
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,140
If he could fill that need,
he would be onto a winner.

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,910
Ilan teamed up with his younger brother,

72
00:04:19,911 --> 00:04:23,630
Kimbal team develop content publishing
software design for news and media

73
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,360
companies at a time when
many venture capitalists,

74
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:30,200
so it never even heard of the Internet.
It's was a major risk.

75
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,920
The products that the mosque brothers came
up with, well, that was called Zip two.

76
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,430
It started life as a tool that would
help people to search for maps and

77
00:04:37,431 --> 00:04:39,260
directions on the Internet with people.

78
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:42,760
Also being able to post information
through something similar to a micro

79
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,340
blogging system, things that were
tough for mask in these early days.

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,181
He had no money,

81
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,240
not even enough to rent an office
and an apartment at the same time.

82
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,620
So in order to combat this,

83
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:55,130
he rented an office where he slept on
a futon and took care of his personal

84
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:58,400
hygiene down with the local y
starting with small newspapers.

85
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,440
Moscow was able to quickly grow his client
base agreements were made with large

86
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,530
media companies including the Chicago
Tribune and the New York Times in order to

87
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,420
allow those companies to use zip to,

88
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,950
to make their content readily
available to readers via the Internet.

89
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,550
The program was used by many similar
companies along with ecommerce sites as a

90
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:18,140
platform for their web presence.

91
00:05:18,141 --> 00:05:21,830
By 1999 visit to corporation
was providing web hosting,

92
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,210
web development and maintenance
services for close to 200 websites.

93
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,420
They came to the attention of the
online city guide citysearch who were

94
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:32,450
interested in a merger. This
deal, it didn't work out,

95
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,720
but another one did often
just four years of operation.

96
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,870
The Zip to cooperation with sold to
Compaq computers for $307 million in cash

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,810
and to further 34
million in stock options.

98
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,133
Okay.

99
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,120
At the age of just 28 Elon Musk,
he was a multimillionaire,

100
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,280
but he was just getting started.

101
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,070
And even before the ink
was dry on the zip to deal,

102
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,190
he had thrown himself into
his next venture and that
was x.com Musk's vision was

103
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:13,580
to create the world's first online bank
and he invested $10 million to kick it

104
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:14,120
off.

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,600
The goal is to offer every service that
you had gas from a conventional bank,

106
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,590
but with the added benefit that you could
send and receive money securely using

107
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,250
only your email address.
x.com was an immediate success.

108
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,660
After just a year of operation.

109
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,720
It was merged with a money
transfer system called infinity.

110
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,670
The combined businesses were
renamed paypal in 2001 now
working with confederacy

111
00:06:34,671 --> 00:06:36,650
founders,
Peter Thiel and Max Levchin.

112
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,790
The business dropped the idea of a fully
functional online bank and focused on

113
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,310
the feature that seemed to
grab everyone's attention,

114
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,180
the ability to send money to and
from anyone who had the same app.

115
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,500
At this early stage. The system, it
relied on a windows based handheld device.

116
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,610
During the first months of
the merger from January,

117
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,820
1999 through October of 2000 Musk was
CEO of [inaudible] dot com during this

118
00:06:58,821 --> 00:06:59,061
time,

119
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:03,410
he set up this viral system that grew it
into the world's largest email payment

120
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,940
processor and new customers.

121
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,110
They were offered a $20 cash cards along
with an additional $10 for referring a

122
00:07:09,111 --> 00:07:10,670
friends within two months.

123
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,760
More than a hundred thousand
new customers had come on board,

124
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:16,700
but not always well within
the company's management.

125
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,730
The problem was Musk's management style,

126
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,200
which can best be
described as dictatorial,

127
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,870
both feel unloved and found it
difficult to work with them.

128
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,960
They were especially frustrated.
It doesn't need to micromanage everything,

129
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,920
just need sands divisions of rose over
which technologies to use and how to

130
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,200
brand and the company.
As a result of such divisions.

131
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:36,320
Thiel ends Levchin organized
a coup against CEO Musk.

132
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,780
When he was meeting with
prospective customers overseas.

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,450
He returns to the country to
discover that he had been fired,

134
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:45,110
the CEO by the board and replaced
by Peter Teal. Shortly thereafter.

135
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,290
The name of the company was changed
to paypal and this time with a second

136
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:49,170
capital p.

137
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,230
From that it grew exponentially leading
to a buyout by Ebay in 2002 the cost of

138
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:57,860
the sale was a staggering
one point $5 billion.

139
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,660
As the largest shareholder,
Musk walked away with a cool $165 million.

140
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,493
Okay.

141
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,670
Even before people were sold,
Musk was onto his next business venture.

142
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,630
Ever since he was a child, he had
been fascinated by space exploration.

143
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,530
He had always been an avid
science fiction reader bands.

144
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:26,600
Now we had the money to turn
science fiction into reality.

145
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:30,500
He was convinced that the earth was
destined to collapse as a life sustaining

146
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:31,040
planet.

147
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,190
The sooner we started working on the
technology required for interplanetary

148
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,950
travel and sustaining life beyond earth,
the better.

149
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,600
In discussions with a friend one day,

150
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,620
Musk complains that despite the vast
improvements in the technology industry,

151
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,470
the space industry has lagged.
Got For behinds.

152
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,340
Since man had set foot on the moon
way back in 1969 it's a peer to him,

153
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,440
but no meaningful progress had been made.

154
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,220
He was determined to change that and
his third company space exploration or

155
00:08:56,221 --> 00:08:59,100
space x was to be his platform to do it.

156
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,940
A major goal of space x is to create
a space vehicle that can take people,

157
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,200
equipment and other necessary resources
to Mars and builds a transportation

158
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:11,370
infrastructure that will allow humans
to become a multiplanetary species.

159
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,800
When Moscot loves the
world in on his vision,

160
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,860
he was immediately subjected
to ridicule industry experts,

161
00:09:16,861 --> 00:09:20,130
dismissed him as a rich board playboy
claiming that his physics degree in

162
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:23,880
previous business ventures, I'll be made
him qualified. Do you conceptualize,

163
00:09:23,881 --> 00:09:25,950
develop and build rockets?
However,

164
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,800
they were underestimating mosque
who was not only a quick study,

165
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:33,000
but who also brought on board the best
engineers from top aerospace companies

166
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:35,760
such as Boeing,
Twa and NASA Musk.

167
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:39,750
He was disappointed that NASA seems
disinterested in space exploration.

168
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:43,290
He wants it to peak the public's interest
in order to encourage NASA to increase

169
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,400
their allocated funds to a project to
land the device on Mars and then build a

170
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,690
bubble by over us.

171
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,100
He also wanted to introduce a cheaper
and safer alternative to space shuttle

172
00:09:53,101 --> 00:09:53,820
travel.

173
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,150
He was struck by the fact that the
Russians were able to produce rockets that

174
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:00,720
were cheaper and safer than anything
that the Americans could come out with.

175
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,380
He traveled to Russia in an attempt to,
to purchase a refurbished ICBM,

176
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,360
but the deal became too complicated.

177
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,830
MUSC next set his sights on creating
and successfully launching a reusable

178
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:14,700
rocket, which he called a Falcon one. The
idea was that it could fly off to space,

179
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,430
return to Earth,
and then we launched back to space again.

180
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:21,090
The first scheduled launch for
Falcon one was in 2005 yeah,

181
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,300
three years later after multiple
failed attempts. How can one,

182
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,490
we're still to have its first successful
flight. Finally, on its fourth attempt,

183
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,530
Falcon one successfully launched
on the back of this success.

184
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,330
Space x was able to secure a one point
$6 billion contract from NASA involving

185
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,220
12 for future flights on their rocket.

186
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,750
Falcon nine to the International Space
Station at Musc is estimated that space x

187
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:47,751
is efforts can minimize the
u s government's expenses
by around $1 billion every

188
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,163
year.

189
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,133
Yeah.

190
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,400
Musk has always been fascinated by
cars and specifically by the dream of

191
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:06,960
creating a breed of electric cars that
totally transform the driving experience.

192
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
While he was still a
sophomore at university,

193
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,700
he had become aware of the
wells depleting resources.

194
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,280
What was needed was an
alternative source of fuel,

195
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,760
one that would not produce
carbon emissions that were
damaging the environment.

196
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,500
It was from these ideas that Musk
decided to pursue a electric cars or year

197
00:11:22,501 --> 00:11:23,790
after launching space acts.

198
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:27,330
Musk was introduced to Al Chacone
and Tom Gauge of AC propulsion,

199
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,650
the company behinds and all electric con
known as the t zero Musk was interested

200
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,430
in mass producing the t zero but
you konijn gauge showed no interest.

201
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:36,320
They did however,

202
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,780
introduce mask to a group of men
who were dedicated to finding a more

203
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:41,460
environmentally friendly vehicle.

204
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:46,120
In July of 2003 Musk teamed up with
three of them in rides, mock tarponing,

205
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:49,280
Gans Martin Eberhard to form
the for Tesla cooperation.

206
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,190
This company was named and recognition
of the father of AC induction motors,

207
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:56,710
Nikola Tesla. From the very beginning,
Tesla faced an uphill battle.

208
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,950
The contraceptive in electric car was
years away from capturing the public

209
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:02,680
attention and it's just as
was the case with space x.

210
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,580
The question was loudly asked how a
visionary with no experience in the car

211
00:12:06,581 --> 00:12:11,110
industry could successfully establish a
new company and a new product and stand

212
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,820
against the industry giants.

213
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,450
What's more they were attempting to do
something that those industry giants,

214
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,420
it's simply been unable to do.
In fact, Robert [inaudible],

215
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,190
CEO of General Motors stated that lithium
ion technology for cars was at least

216
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,900
10 years into the future as a result
of the lack of industry enthusiasm.

217
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:32,200
Very few investors wanted anything
to do with Tesla. In fact,

218
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,590
Moscow to funds the majority of the
operations of the company itself.

219
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,640
The goal of having the furnace road stone
rolling off the assembly line by 2007

220
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,700
never materialized as costs just continued
to mouse just as with x.com years

221
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,190
earlier,

222
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:48,460
tensions arose among the management's
mosque who was chairman of the board,

223
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:51,820
has no faith in Martin Eberhard.
The presidents of the company.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Before long they got her heart had been
ousted and MUSC put himself in full

225
00:12:55,301 --> 00:13:00,130
control. He was now the CEO of two
startups and even for a dynamo like Musk,

226
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,360
this was still too much. It's still,
but he had to make both companies work.

227
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,380
His master plan at for Tesla was to build
a luxury electric sportscar along with

228
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:12,460
eight line of more affordable cars
with electric power and zero emissions.

229
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,340
In 2008 the first
roadster was shipped out.

230
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,400
This $110,000 electric sportscar could
run for 200 miles on a single charge and

231
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:25,120
was capable of going from zero to 60
miles per hour in less than four seconds.

232
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,080
The more affordable electric car was
called the Tesla model s it's released,

233
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:33,850
began in June of 2012 sales took off and
there are currently 500 rolling off the

234
00:13:33,851 --> 00:13:35,320
production line every week,

235
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,190
as well as being the CEO of Tesla mosque
is also the chairman of the board of

236
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:41,380
directors of another
environmental company,

237
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,840
so the city will not the
founder of this company.

238
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:47,860
He is very involved in
achieving the company's mission
to deliver complete solar

239
00:13:47,861 --> 00:13:51,520
energy systems, do the end users
without any of the upfront fees.

240
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,480
It also promised reduced utility bills
for all of its customers by offering free

241
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:58,080
installation and zero down
payments to homeowners.

242
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,590
MUSC has made it easier for consumers
to afford solar energy and this

243
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,210
revolutionized the way that
the solar industry has run.

244
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,560
So the city has enjoyed tremendous growth
and success with clients that include

245
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:10,390
Ebay,
Walmart in the u s military.

246
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:14,590
This has made it to the number one solar
power service provider in the United

247
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,423
States.

248
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,490
As it being an industry
leader in space travel,

249
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,890
electric cars and solar
power is not enough.

250
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,040
In August of 2013 MUSC proposed a
completely new mode of personal transport.

251
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,700
He called it the hyperloop.

252
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,390
The concept will allow people to travel
between large cities at the speed of

253
00:14:39,391 --> 00:14:44,391
sound allowing passengers to get from
San Francisco to Los Angeles in about 30

254
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:45,354
minutes.

255
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,250
It involves a vacuum sealed pod that
rides on top of electromagnetic waves very

256
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:54,320
simply. This is of similar to the way
a surfer's board rides ocean waves.

257
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,370
The partners will glide across the track
at speeds of many hundreds of miles per

258
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,960
hour.
This eliminates the problem,

259
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,670
the friction created by wheels on the
tracks the same month that Musk unveiled

260
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:07,970
plans for the hyperloop, the crown
sourcing and collaboration platform.

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,810
Jumpstart Fund was established comprised
of more than a hundred engineers,

262
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,710
developers, and investors. The creeps up
on the hyperloop as their first project.

263
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:20,570
In 2014 they formed a
hyperloop transportation
technologies and undertook a

264
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,680
feasibility study.

265
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,600
In 2015 MUSC ran the student competition
to design and build hyperloop pods.

266
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,350
I space x sponsored mile long track
was built in order to run the pods on.

267
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,610
On July the 20th 2017 Musk announced
that he had gained verbal government's

268
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,750
approval to build a hyperloop
track between New York
City and to Washington d c

269
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,600
Elon Musk is one guy who it is
a challenge to keep up with.

270
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:46,460
In the 12 months from December, 2015
to December, 2016 he still wanted it.

271
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:49,740
No less than three companies
open AI and not for profit.

272
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,620
Artificial intelligence research
company near Relink Cane,

273
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,800
euro technology startup with the aim of
integrating the human brain with AI and

274
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:00,950
is the boring company which aims to bring
down the cost of tunnel boring by 10

275
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,913
fold.

276
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,370
Okay.

277
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,970
Elon Musk has been married two times.
He met his first wife, Justine Wilson,

278
00:16:14,971 --> 00:16:17,790
while they were both students at
Queen's University in Ontario.

279
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,530
They tie the knots into thousands.

280
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:23,610
Justine is a fantasy novelist who
described her life with Elon as a dream

281
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:27,390
lifestyle. There was empty at the court.
Her husband was so focused on his work.

282
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,580
That's even when he was at home,
his mind,

283
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:33,990
it didn't seem to be that the marriage
ended in 2008 in a very messy public

284
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:36,690
divorce in on and Justine
have five children together,

285
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,790
a set of twins and a set of triplets.

286
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,180
Moscot met his second wife to do
the Riley has a London nightclub.

287
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,990
They were married just six weeks after
he filed for divorce from Justine.

288
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,390
The wedding took place.
It's Skeeto Carlson in Scotland.

289
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:52,980
He was 39 and she was 23 things apparently
didn't go well with MUSC announcing

290
00:16:52,981 --> 00:16:56,820
their separation just two years later on
Twitter. It was an amazing four years.

291
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,790
I will love you forever. You will
make someone very happy. One day,

the couple they got back together in 2014
but the divorce was finalized towards

293
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:08,190
the end of 2016 when it comes
to the future of Elon Musk,

294
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:12,030
the best advice is to watch this space
has never backed down from his ambition

295
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,270
to travel to Mars, and it's
possibly even retire there one day.

296
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,320
Until that happens,

297
00:17:16,321 --> 00:17:19,680
we can be assured that he will continue
to revolutionize the way that the world

298
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:24,030
consumes energy benefits from
technology and travels into space.
