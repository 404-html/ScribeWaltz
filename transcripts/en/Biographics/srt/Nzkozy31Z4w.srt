1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,260
The seventh is one of the most
famous women who has ever lived.

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,060
Her story has inspired poets,

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:06,751
dramatists,

4
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,740
and artists for more than 2000
years through cunning and guile.

5
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:15,390
She survived to rule Egypt as all of
us siblings perished by the wayside.

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,660
I think beauty and charm led to one of
the most celebrated romances in history

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,010
and the ancient world's ultimate tragedy.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,420
In this week's biographics,

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,350
we get up close and personal with
the original Queen of denial,

10
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
Cleopatra,

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,470
why the time of the birth of Cleopatra,

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,370
the seventh and 69 bce.

13
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,360
Egypt had a 3000 year old
history of power and decline.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:52,160
The country was ruled by a dynasty of
Pharaoh's each with a named ptolemy who

15
00:00:52,161 --> 00:00:55,540
had arrived from Macedonia in 323 bce.

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,091
Now,

17
00:00:56,091 --> 00:01:00,140
however they face the danger of
invasion from the menacing Roman empire.

18
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:02,480
First ptolemies had ruled benevolently,

19
00:01:02,481 --> 00:01:03,620
but their descendants,

20
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,380
including Cleopatra's
father proved to be weak,

21
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,210
even foolish leaders as a results
Cleopatra's early years were unsettled.

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,750
She knew that her family was at war
with the people that it rules and with

23
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,440
itself,

24
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,660
the people suffered under
the cruelty of Ptolemy.

25
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,190
The Twelfth Cleopatra's father,

26
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,140
and they resented his alliance with Rome
when Cleopatra was just four years old,

27
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:28,250
the citizens of Alexandria rioted
and Chase Ptolemy out of Egypt.

28
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,760
He fled to Romance Cleopatra's
oldest sister Berenice became queen.

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,631
Three years later,

30
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:35,800
ptolemy returns to Egypt with
the help of Roman General Pompei.

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,410
He snatched back power from
baroness and ruled again as Pharaoh.

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:42,710
One of his first orders was for
his oldest daughter to be executed.

33
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,640
Cleopatra now had two surviving
sisters and two younger brothers.

34
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,700
All of ptolemies children
hoped to eventually ruled,

35
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:53,190
which made them all rivals shortly
after the execution of baroness,

36
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,770
the oldest daughter of Ptolemy,

37
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:55,510
Cleopatra.

38
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,280
Trifacta died in mysterious circumstances.

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:01,640
Many historians believe that she
was poisoned by one of her siblings.

40
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:01,911
Now,

41
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,310
Cleopatra had only one sister still alive,

42
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,860
the youngest Asano.

43
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,690
She must've wondered how
long she would survive.

44
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:08,901
Her.

45
00:02:08,901 --> 00:02:10,910
Two younger brothers were named Ptolemy.

46
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,930
According to the custom,

47
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,080
they would both eventually become
rulers of Egypt as Ptolemy,

48
00:02:15,081 --> 00:02:16,910
the 13th and Ptolemy the 14th.

49
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,710
By the time she was 14.

50
00:02:18,711 --> 00:02:21,590
Cleopatra was ptolemies
oldest living daughter.

51
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:22,460
When he died,

52
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,840
she would become queen as the wife of
her younger brother Ptolemy the 13th for

53
00:02:26,841 --> 00:02:27,800
the young girl.

54
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:31,040
The prospect filter with
both excitement and terror,

55
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,200
vividly recalling the
fate of her two sisters,

56
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,310
she fed the enemies,

57
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:35,720
might also tried to kill her,

58
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:37,490
but the young girl was clever.

59
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,600
She had made friends with powerful
courtiers who she felt would protect her.

60
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,380
Cleopatra was groomed for
rulership from her early teens.

61
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:47,150
She learns new languages,

62
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,200
including Egyptian,

63
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,290
which surprisingly was not
spoken at all in the royal court.

64
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,610
All her family members,

65
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:53,900
they simply spoke Greek.

66
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,840
She also used religion to
support our claim to the throne,

67
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,000
claiming to be the
daughter of the sun gods,

68
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,550
ancient royal title.

69
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,570
When their father died,

70
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,780
Cleopatra and her husband
slash brother began their rule.

71
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:08,140
It was 51 BC and she was
nearly 18 years of age,

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,940
10 years older than the new king.

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,510
This allowed her to assume full
responsibility for ruling the country.

74
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,250
It was a particularly complex time.

75
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,570
In addition to domestic problems which
included a discontented peasantry brought

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,890
to its knees by famine.

77
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,100
Not to mention the hostility of
other members of our own family.

78
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,320
There were also problematic
foreign relations.

79
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,730
The most pressing issue
was the unrelenting demands
for taxes coming from Rome.

80
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,100
Despite the requirements of
having a husband Ptolemy,

81
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:34,780
the 13th appointed to rule with her.

82
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,690
She didn't take kindly to
having him tagging along.

83
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:42,280
Her solution was to oust him from his
position and rule alone for the next 18

84
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,114
months.

85
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,350
One thing that we knew for sure was
that she could not beat the Romans that

86
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,900
their military game at this point,

87
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,890
so therefore she had to take off where
I left off and keep appeasing the Roman

88
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,724
overlords.

89
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:01,420
She attempted damage control by working
with the Roman oppressors in the hope

90
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:04,630
that they would give up on
Egypt entirely like a father.

91
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,040
She chose survival,

92
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,260
but she had one advantage over him.

93
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,273
Cleopatra,

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,930
she was clever and she knew how to play
the cards that she was dealt to best

95
00:04:13,931 --> 00:04:14,710
advantage.

96
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,750
She would continue to do
so throughout her reign.

97
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,950
Up until the very end,

98
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,730
she wasn't allowed to fold her hands
if she could see any way to play to the

99
00:04:21,731 --> 00:04:22,780
best of her ability.

100
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,270
And she would absolutely
bluff if necessary.

101
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,650
She would eliminate every other folk
in the game and keep a few aces up our

102
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:34,651
sleeve by willing key Alexandrians
Romans and the priests over to our site.

103
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,680
She was a brilliant strategist even at
the young age when she became regions.

104
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,191
However,

105
00:04:39,191 --> 00:04:42,520
given that she was ruling Egypt and given
the tempestuous history of our family,

106
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,760
nothing was going to
come easy to a new ruler,

107
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,320
especially a female one.

108
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,890
Her little brother had his supporters
or should I say his controllers,

109
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:53,980
and they wanted to have
the power in their hands,

110
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,720
not in the hands of Cleopatra.

111
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,830
When I say they,

112
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:59,980
I'm speaking mainly of a
man named goodness Pompei,

113
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:02,500
who at the time was the
supreme control river.

114
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:06,280
Him The man who gave her father the title
of King and the person who was given

115
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,810
the rights to possess Cypress.

116
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,550
It is highly unlikely that Pompei saw
Cleopatra as too smart to simply be

117
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,440
mollified as her father had been.

118
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,850
She would be hard to control and a
constant threat to Roman dominance over

119
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,510
Egypt.

120
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,690
How there's a brother needed
some assistance and this
was given to him in the

121
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:23,920
form of room and support.

122
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,570
Pompei would show up occasionally to
formally recognize the little brother over

123
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:32,470
the big sister as the ruler of Egypt
with pompey is backing Ptolemy,

124
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:37,420
the 13th when to war with his big
sister driving half from power in 49 ce,

125
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,290
Cleopatra discovered that her husband
was plotting with palm pay to send

126
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,750
soldiers to kidnap and possibly kill her.

127
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:47,110
She knew that she must leave
Egypt's and so she said,

128
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,944
sail for Syria.

129
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,490
Eventually hope to recruit an army to
help our wind back the throne from her.

130
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:51,740
Now.

131
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,570
Sixteen year old husband slash brother
Cleopatra choose to flee to Syria because

132
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:59,780
the ptolemies had once ruled that the
king of Syria was also an enemy of Rome.

133
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,763
Like Cleopatra.

134
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,300
He fears that his own country would be
taken over by the mighty Roman Empire.

135
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,750
She took her only surviving sister
I'll send into exile without.

136
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,170
This was partly to protect the
younger girl from her brother's raft,

137
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,630
but also to stop her from
seizing the throne herself.

138
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,770
While these dramas were playing out
in the ptolemaic dynasty up north,

139
00:06:23,771 --> 00:06:28,750
a bloody civil war was taking place
General Julius Caesar Battles and defeated

140
00:06:28,751 --> 00:06:30,490
the forces of general pompey.

141
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,700
Pompey arrived in Glucagon in
Egypt's hoping to get money,

142
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,180
food,

143
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,720
men and ships because he was running
low on what he needed to defeat Caesar.

144
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,980
Up until that time,

145
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,000
the Egyptians had been on the receiving
ends of much of the support from room

146
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:47,080
due to the relationship established
between Cleopatra's father and Pompei.

147
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,880
Before Caesar rose up to challenge
the Redmond general and now the pump.

148
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:53,320
They had just lost
badly to seize a fossil.

149
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,600
This he needed Egypt's help.

150
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,650
Meanwhile sees it was in pursuits and
also looking for aid for his military

151
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:00,220
needs.

152
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,940
He arrived in Alexandria with
a rather modest military force.

153
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,500
However,

154
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,830
it seems to the young Egyptian king and
his advisors that Cesar was going to be

155
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:10,360
the eventual victor in Rome.

156
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:14,470
If the king continue to support Pompei
to continue his war against Caesar on

157
00:07:14,471 --> 00:07:15,400
Egyptian soil,

158
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,140
the battles could devastate Egypt's and
if pompei eventually last season would

159
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:22,630
be enraged against the
Egyptian readership.

160
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,610
Caught between a rock and a hard place.

161
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,370
As soon as Pompei landed
with troops that palace,

162
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:27,730
Iom,

163
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,121
Ptolemy,

164
00:07:28,121 --> 00:07:28,840
the 13th,

165
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,381
had Pompei,

166
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:32,620
ambushed and killed event
delivered pompous had to Desisa.

167
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,131
However,

168
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,090
the king miscalculated.

169
00:07:34,091 --> 00:07:37,810
How happy sees would be to see as enemies
had presented to him by the Egyptian

170
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:38,410
king.

171
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,420
Pompei may have been his rival,

172
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,950
but it was up to Caesar to decide Pompez
face not have the upstart Egyptian

173
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:45,400
king.

174
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,750
You said that right.

175
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,440
Even though he was horrified
by the brutal murder of Pompei,

176
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:54,550
Caesar wanted to keep the peace he had
come to Egypt to collect a huge sum of

177
00:07:54,551 --> 00:07:57,580
money that you've claimed
Cleopatra's father had owed him.

178
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:01,440
He ordered both Ptolemy and Cleopatra
to meet with him to discuss the P

179
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,050
streeting.

180
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,010
The now 21 year old queen
saw her opportunity to act.

181
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,830
She slipped past ptolemies general,

182
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,560
the killers.

183
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,840
It was blocking Glucagon and sales
along the coastline to Alexandria bike,

184
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,700
way of denial.

185
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,400
Then she went to see Caesar at the palace.

186
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:19,210
Cleopatra had developed into a
very mature and savvy young women.

187
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,260
Legend has it that she secret at a self
in a rolled up bedroll in order to get

188
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:26,170
into the palace that this
has largely been debunked,

189
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,920
but she did not need to go through quite
so covert length to get an audience

190
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,630
with Cesar in Alexandria.

191
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,050
She had been communicating with him
from her posts over the border shortly

192
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:38,410
before sneaking past to kill us
and heading toward Alexandria.

193
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,370
She sent word to Caesar that she was
coming or he had sent word to her,

194
00:08:42,371 --> 00:08:43,210
telling her to come.

195
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:43,930
Either way,

196
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:48,370
it's likely it was no surprise that
Cleopatra was arriving in the harbor that

197
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:48,520
night.

198
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,660
Apparently Cleopatra,

199
00:08:49,661 --> 00:08:53,680
dawn's her most impressive outfits and
took great effort to look beautiful for

200
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:55,980
her audience with season whatever she did,

201
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,580
worked a treat and sees the ordered
that she'd be restored to the throne.

202
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,151
Naturally.

203
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:03,750
When Ptolemy arrived to find Cleopatra
and the palace re-installed as CCO

204
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,410
regions,

205
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,300
he was not at all pleased.

206
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,080
In fact,

207
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,820
he threw a royal fit as impressed
as Caesar was with the Queen.

208
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:15,320
He wisely took into consideration
the support that her brother,

209
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:15,750
Hans,

210
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,970
among many of the upper
crust of Alexandria.

211
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,451
Therefore,

212
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,940
he decided to handle
the situation astutely,

213
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,040
he wisely reds to brother and sister,

214
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:23,940
the will of the father,

215
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:26,910
which stated that he wanted
them to rule together,

216
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,870
but the young king,

217
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,820
he was not appeased.

218
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,480
He ran out of the palace and threw down
his crown in a terrible rage and a new

219
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,120
season.

220
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,150
Allow Ptolemy to leave the
city and join his sister,

221
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:36,611
Austin.

222
00:09:36,611 --> 00:09:36,781
No.

223
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:39,810
In Sicily days after the
Alexandrian war ended,

224
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:43,110
the advocated king's body
was found lying in the harbor

225
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,050
for the first time in years.

226
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,730
Cleopatra now felt safe,

227
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:51,970
uh,

228
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,880
enemy husbands,

229
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:56,740
along with his advisors were dead and
Caesar had promised to protect her and her

230
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,580
new husband,

231
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,970
her surviving 11 year olds,

232
00:09:58,971 --> 00:09:59,771
brother Ptolemy,

233
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,290
the 14th with Caesar.

234
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:04,930
She sailed down the Nile in order to be
test subjects and impress them with our

235
00:10:04,931 --> 00:10:05,530
power.

236
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:07,870
Rumor spread that she was
pregnant with seizes child,

237
00:10:07,871 --> 00:10:09,200
which came to be known as ces,

238
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:09,910
Arion.

239
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,370
When he's at return to Rome,

240
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,940
he left at 15,000 of his finest soldiers
to guard the queen after taking control

241
00:10:15,941 --> 00:10:16,590
of Egypt.

242
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,510
Return to Rome where he was
hailed as a hero before long.

243
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,700
Cleopatra had come north to join him.

244
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,480
She claimed that the trip was to
negotiate a peace treaty between Egypt and

245
00:10:25,481 --> 00:10:25,810
Rome,

246
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,570
but she also wanted to make
sure of Caesar's protection.

247
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,590
She did not once want a younger brother
or his advises to try to seize power in

248
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,000
Egypt while she was away.

249
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,620
Many Romans chief,

250
00:10:35,621 --> 00:10:37,990
the relationship between
Cleopatra and Caesar.

251
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,340
It was widely feared that Caesar would
names dot Darian as his app and so the

252
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,390
Cleopatra would then have a hold on
the Roman empire through his son sees a

253
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:50,050
celebrated his victories by parading his
captives through the streets of Rome.

254
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:54,070
Cleopatra sister also know who led
the Egyptian army against Caesar,

255
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,710
was dragged through the streets,

256
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:57,550
back headed in chains.

257
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:00,100
It was a disgrace for women
to appear in public this way.

258
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:04,020
At the time it was the custom for Egyptian
women to wear a long cloak and avail

259
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,360
outside of their homes.

260
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,060
However,

261
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,430
Austin,

262
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,360
I was lucky,

263
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,560
unlike other prisoners,

264
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,550
she was not killed.

265
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,840
Caesar felt that the Romans might right
if they saw a princess publicly executed

266
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,471
to give.

267
00:11:14,471 --> 00:11:18,010
Thanks for the victory at the battle
of soulless sees that builds a new

268
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:18,461
template,

269
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:18,970
Rome.

270
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,720
He also paid for a beautiful statue of
Cleopatra to be put on display in the

271
00:11:22,721 --> 00:11:23,350
temple.

272
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,650
It showed her as a mother
holding and in her arms

273
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,390
as a

274
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,710
reward for his victories.

275
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:36,170
The Senate made sees a dictator for life,

276
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:40,490
but some Romans feared that Caesar was
becoming too powerful and that he wanted

277
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,324
to be king.

278
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,600
About 60 conspirators decided
that Caesar had to be killed.

279
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,620
The plants which was led by brutus and
Cassius was carried through immediately

280
00:11:48,621 --> 00:11:50,900
following a Senate meeting in 44 BC,

281
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,970
the shocking news of Caesar's murder
spread through the Roman empire like

282
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,863
wildfire.

283
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,920
Cleopatra who was in Rome at the time
of the assassination lost no time in

284
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:03,250
hurrying back to Egypt now that
season protect who was dead.

285
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,620
A kingdom was once more in danger.

286
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:09,550
Many hostile nations saw Egypt as a
rich prize and hope to conquer it.

287
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:13,450
Cleopatra kept us sciences area enclosed
by her side because she feared that he

288
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:16,750
might be murdered by his
enemies on her return to Egypt.

289
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:18,270
Cleopatra found this sister.

290
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,680
I'll ask to know who had been
released from Raymond Captivity,

291
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,580
was plotting with an anti seize a
faction in the hype of seizing power.

292
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,020
Many of the nobles in the Egyptian court
supported arsenault and joined her in

293
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:31,150
her conspiracy against Cleopatra.

294
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,140
At this time that nation was suffering
a crisis due to the failure of the Nile

295
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:35,800
floods.

296
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,070
There was not enough water in the river
to spread rich mode over the fields in

297
00:12:39,071 --> 00:12:39,940
order to irrigate them.

298
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:40,660
As a result,

299
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,130
farmers' crops and animals died,

300
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:44,710
and as many families suffered
from famine and disease,

301
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,700
many nobles and officials were angry
that Cleopatra did not take moves to help

302
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,020
the victims of the famine.

303
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,760
The tenuous situation for
Cleopatra Mandatory needed
a new Rehmann protector who

304
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:55,594
she could lean on,

305
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,090
and that came in the form of Marc Antony.

306
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:02,650
CAESARS murder led to three terrible
years of warfare in Rome as different

307
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:07,270
groups of Roman senators and members of
leading Roman families struggled to take

308
00:13:07,271 --> 00:13:07,750
control.

309
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,000
The rival armies were led by three
powerful men and each hopes to take seizes

310
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:12,490
places.

311
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:12,990
Ruler,

312
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,490
their names were octavian
who sees his nephew,

313
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,490
Mark Antony and Marcus.

314
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,990
Let us finally in 42 bce,

315
00:13:19,991 --> 00:13:24,280
the room and lands were divided among
the three Manzanita control of the entire

316
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,840
eastern Mediterranean region,

317
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,360
which included Egypt's

318
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:34,020
and control of Egypt,

319
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:34,381
Tanzania.

320
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:36,140
It's still needed Cleopatra's support,

321
00:13:36,141 --> 00:13:38,150
and he feared that she
might support his enemies.

322
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,020
He needed goals from Egypt in order to
pay his armies in order to keep control

323
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,850
of his share of the empire.

324
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,320
He also needed Egypt screen in order to
feed his men Anthony rates of Cleopatra

325
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,760
runs when she did not reply,

326
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,260
he summoned to meet him.

327
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,200
Cleopatra was in no hurry
to response Anthony.

328
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:54,801
Instead.

329
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,120
She deliberately took her time.

330
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,520
She knew that anthony needed Egypt skulls
and in return she planned to ask for

331
00:14:00,521 --> 00:14:01,354
his protection.

332
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,560
She also wanted his help to kill enemies,

333
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,030
including her sister,

334
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:05,510
Austin.

335
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,950
I as neat waited for Cleopatra to
arrive to the plans meeting and tacitus.

336
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,850
He heard news of large crowds
gathering to witness an amazing site.

337
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:16,850
Cleopatra was sailing up the
riverside nus in a barge.

338
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,930
It's sales popple.

339
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:21,440
It's is urging is end with silver
rose to the sound of the flute,

340
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,210
blended with pipes and loot.

341
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,920
The sales were made of silk,

342
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,900
irr and costly cough from China.

343
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,000
It was a floating palace.

344
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,870
The queen herself was dressed as
the Greek goddess of Love Aphrodite.

345
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,660
She laid on my couch beneath
the canopy of gold cloth.

346
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,210
Marc Antony was mesmerized and he
invited Cleopatra Design with them,

347
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,760
but the queen refused insisting that
he joined her on her royal barge.

348
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,800
She did a great cat without preparations.

349
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,900
She wants it to Anthony to be delighted,

350
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,770
astonished,

351
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,990
and most importantly impressed.

352
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:55,240
She arranged for her to be decorated
with thousands of tiny oil lamps and

353
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,440
glittering flickering patterns of lights,

354
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,400
Cleopatra,

355
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,000
Metadata to it several times during her
visits to toss this on each occasion,

356
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,890
she dressed as the goddess Aphrodite.

357
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,760
She offered ends and the crowns of
vine leaves say symbol of diagnosis,

358
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,020
the Greek God of wine.

359
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,810
She was reminding Antony that
according to legend task,

360
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,440
this was the place where aphrodite
and diagnosis met and fell in love.

361
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,460
Cleopatra's seduction worked how
dramatic visit to Tarsus had one.

362
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:23,900
Anthony support in her struggled to
remain the ruler of Egypt as he forgot his

363
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:26,660
war against the Parthians
and hurried to Egypt.

364
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,950
They spends the winter of 41 bce and
Alexandria together during which time

365
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:33,050
Cleopatra on the left hand side.

366
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,041
During this time,

367
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,480
her two remaining siblings,

368
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:36,630
arsenault and Ptolemy,

369
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,131
14th,

370
00:15:37,131 --> 00:15:37,964
were put to death.

371
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,960
Shortly thereafter,

372
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,610
Cleopatra became pregnant.

373
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,820
Anthony did not remain in Europe
to see the birth of his twins,

374
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,530
a boy and a girl in 40 BC had to return
to Rome because his wife fava was

375
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,450
leading a rebellion against Octavian.

376
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,500
Cleopatra continued to really Jeb.

377
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:56,660
It's because Anthony did not return for
another four years when he sailed back

378
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:00,110
in 36 BC after a disastrous
defeat and Patho,

379
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,580
Cleopatra welcomes him.

380
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,910
She needed a strong ally to
help keep Egypt independence.

381
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,750
Anthony plans to set up an empire in
North Africa and the Middle East to

382
00:16:08,751 --> 00:16:10,280
challenges rivals in Rome.

383
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:14,630
Cleopatra supported his plans because
they would increase her own power in 35

384
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:15,350
BC.

385
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,910
The Pat had a third child,

386
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,590
a son.

387
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,530
They named Ptolemy.

388
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Philadelphus early in 34,

389
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,590
[inaudible] invaded Armenia returning to
Alexandria and triumph in a magnificent

390
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:25,221
celebration.

391
00:16:25,221 --> 00:16:27,770
Cleopatra was crowned Queen of the Kings.

392
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,401
The couples,

393
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:31,510
young children were given royal
titles over Middle East Atlanta

394
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,270
topper,

395
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,440
and then politicians lead,

396
00:16:38,441 --> 00:16:39,350
bike sees his nephew,

397
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:43,820
Octavian were shocked by reports of
Antony and Cleopatra Space to set up an

398
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:44,780
empire on their writing.

399
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,220
They will also angry this anthony had
divorced his Roman wife and outraged

400
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:53,480
Octavian personally declared war
against Cleopatra and all of Egypt.

401
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:56,150
Even though Anthony had tried
to avoid conflict with Rome,

402
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,940
it had now become impossible to avoid.

403
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,380
This was especially so
after the Roman Senate.

404
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:05,240
It's found out about his will in which
he declared his intention to be buried in

405
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:07,010
Egypt's beside cleopatra.

406
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:10,520
Anthony was dismissed from all public
appointments even though the army

407
00:17:10,521 --> 00:17:14,690
assembled by Antony and Cleopatra was
large at the famous battle of actium in

408
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:19,691
September of 31 bce constituted a first
fundamental step toward their defeat.

409
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,021
By now,

410
00:17:21,021 --> 00:17:23,660
they were considered
foreigners and enemies of Rome.

411
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,380
Anthony succeeded in taking police iom
and it's getting close to the gates of

412
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:31,400
Alexandria in the spring of 30 bce
and mad well of events followed,

413
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,090
reminded the Cleopatra and shot in the
mausoleum that she had built for herself

414
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:35,930
was debt.

415
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,980
On hearing this news,

416
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:40,640
which was denied immediately after
that too late and the wounded himself

417
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:41,300
fatally,

418
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,380
and as he was dying,

419
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,670
he was taken to the mausoleum,

420
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,480
Cleopatra,

421
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,313
wept for Antony,

422
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,070
and tried in various ways to take her
own life that she was watched over by

423
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,070
Octavian is men who wanted to take
it back to Rome a few days before her

424
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:53,551
departure,

425
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:53,941
however,

426
00:17:53,941 --> 00:17:57,660
Cleopatra and managed to
evade surveillance and
kills herself probably would

427
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,210
snake poison which was brought
into the prison in a basket.

428
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,880
Cleopatra was the last
independent ruler of Egypt.

429
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,830
Death marked the end of over 3000 Gloria
years of Egyptian civilization and

430
00:18:07,831 --> 00:18:08,664
Egyptian power.

431
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,150
Yes,

432
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:10,380
she could not bear to live.

433
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,140
While foreign is ruled a
beloved country with her death,

434
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,790
Egypt lost its most famous and
possibly its greatest ever queen.

435
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:20,730
