5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:17,110
[inaudible] was a night he became
the richest man in all of France.

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:21,170
It became famous after battling alongside
Joan of arc and the name of God,

7
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:23,680
and he was well loved
by the French people.

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:28,450
No one could have imagined that just a
few years later he would be sentenced to

9
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:33,451
death for summoning a demon and murdering
over a hundred children for hundreds

10
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:35,051
of years.

11
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:38,590
He was considered to be one of the first
serial killers in recorded history.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,161
However,

13
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:43,210
some modern day historians believe that
he was frames and they aren't trying to

14
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:44,050
exonerate him.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,140
So did he really kill innocent children
as part of a satanic sacrifice or is he

16
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:53,380
one of the most misunderstood
figures in all of history?

17
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,763
Yeah,

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,040
shoulder when he was born in his
family castle, the Sham Tassa.

19
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:15,540
So law in 1405 when he was a
child shoulder raise parents,

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,080
they passed away and he was raised
by his grandfather. Jacques to crawl.

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,080
Gilles Ray was born during
the hundred years war,

22
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:25,740
which was a conflict between the
noble families of England and France.

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,860
It began in 1337 and ended in 1453 meaning
that the war went on for 116 years.

24
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,460
Multiple generations grew up in
nonstop warfare, kidnapping, death,

25
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:41,010
and torture just became
a part of normal life.

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,970
Considering how dangerous it wasn't that
time it became mandatory for all men in

27
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,160
noble families to be trained in
combat and warfare. At 16 years old,

28
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:53,010
children a rescued the Duke of Brittany
who had been kidnapped and taken

29
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,810
prisoner as a reward for saving the Duke.

30
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:59,640
The king awarded Jill Deray land grants
that allowed him to acquire massive

31
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:04,350
properties for free. Since he was 12
years old, Jill's grandfather, Joan,

32
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:06,780
was already trying to arrange
a marriage for the bike.

33
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,490
His first attempt was with a young heiress
who was only four years olds off to

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:15,090
trying and failing to arrange a
marriage for his grandson a few times.

35
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,900
Jolanda [inaudible] was able to broker
and agreements with the noble families

36
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:19,590
and Brittany.

37
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:23,590
Since Jill save that Duke's life when
he was in his early twenties [inaudible]

38
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,670
ray married Catherine to
through La Dochester Brittany.

39
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,170
She was the heiress to one of the biggest
fortunes in all of France back then.

40
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:33,570
Women could not own or handle money,

41
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:36,480
so estates were controlled
by fathers and husbands.

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,830
So as to the air of one of the biggest
fortunes in France from the deray family,

43
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:44,850
Marion Catherine Dubois made them one
of the richest couples in the entire

44
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:45,684
country.

45
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,130
Many everyone has heard
the story of Joe Navarro,

46
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,610
but it's important to remind you of
a tail because her feet shows so many

47
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,170
parallels to shield array.

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,220
The French city of only all had been
surrounded and captured by the English.

49
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,030
Joan of arc was just a 17 year old
peasant girl when she appeared before King

50
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:13,840
Charles the seventh and requested to use
his army to defeat the English and free

51
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,590
only on,

52
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:18,670
it's hard to imagine how such a young
woman without any Nobel status could have

53
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:22,930
had an audience with the king, let alone
get him to agree to handover and army.

54
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,370
But apparently she was very convincing.
Joan claimed that Michael the Archangel,

55
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,890
appeared to her in a vision
and that God was on his side.

56
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,700
She also claimed that she could
miraculously heal her wounds.

57
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,990
She demonstrated before the court even
the deepest wounds would heal with the

58
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:38,824
power of God.

59
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:43,360
She claims that he was helping her attain
supernatural powers in order to become

60
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,230
invincible.

61
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:48,220
Some documents actually claimed that the
king was actually terrified of Joan and

62
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,890
that he was practically forced to say yes.

63
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,270
Shoulder a was 25 years old at the time
he became the marshal of the army and

64
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:58,810
Joan Devoxx righthand
man in just nine days.

65
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:02,800
The two of them led the Ami to victory
for France and they became national

66
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:05,260
heroes and holy figures in society.

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,220
The fact that they fought in the name
of God and the Archangel Michael was

68
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:13,630
enough to reinvigorate French citizens,
Catholic faith, as you might imagine,

69
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:16,870
it was extremely humiliating for the
English to know that they were defeated by

70
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:19,330
a teenage girl when she
was just 19 years old.

71
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:23,080
Gen Ivanka was captured by the Bug
Indian party who agree with the French

72
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:24,760
nobleman spying for the English.

73
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:29,020
She was taken to court in England and
in 1431 she was burned at the stake for

74
00:04:29,021 --> 00:04:32,920
witchcraft and memory lived on in the
hearts of the French people and she was

75
00:04:32,921 --> 00:04:35,740
canonized as a saint
by the Catholic church.

76
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,950
The Burgundian party managed to kill up,
hasn't gone like Joan of arc,

77
00:04:46,951 --> 00:04:50,670
but it was far more difficult to capture
a well-protected noble person like

78
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:51,504
shoulder ray.

79
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:54,920
He became the marshal of France and he
was even more rich and powerful and it

80
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:59,210
wasn't before because he also received
awards for winning the see Giovanni aunt.

81
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,150
He was also able to strike business deals
with other nobles who wanted to work

82
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:03,570
with him.

83
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,830
His court grew to be even more luxurious
than the king of France and the wealthy

84
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:11,970
leaders of the Catholic church. He decided
to retire from fighting. At this point,

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,540
he was still very young and had all the
money in the worlds to do essentially

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,770
whatever he wanted with.

87
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,920
Just like today when people get a
windfall of money at a very early age,

88
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,370
they sometimes make some stupid
decisions on how to spend it.

89
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,040
Sports cars and designer watches
hadn't been invented yet,

90
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,400
but he did invest in
several different estates.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,380
Since this was investing in real estate,

92
00:05:31,381 --> 00:05:34,530
his family found these kinds
of purchases to be acceptable,

93
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:38,760
but it started to get into too crazy.
When Jill deray began producing plays,

94
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:43,910
he spent a small fortune on theatrical
reenactments of his battles during the

95
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:44,911
hundred years war today,

96
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:49,120
producing multimillion dollar Broadway
plays and movies are completely normal

97
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:52,440
but mag. Then he was completely
unheard off his play,

98
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:57,441
how to vote 150 speaking roles and over
500 extras who acted as in the battle.

99
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,210
600 different costumes were commissioned
for the performance and Taylor's around

100
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:05,060
all the on while working
around the clock to make them.

101
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,920
He also gave his staff
and even the audience and
unlimited buffet of free food,

102
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,910
which pretty much guarantee that everyone
in town would show up to the formats

103
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,021
and his own way.

104
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:18,770
He was actually creating jobs and
making people happy by entertaining and

105
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:22,250
feeding the peasant class.
But from the perspective of his family,

106
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,880
this was horrifying.
Has inlaws is in Brittany,

107
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:29,920
spent multiple generations saving and
investing so that they had a family legacy

108
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:34,160
and it was sickening to them that this
young man was practically burning cash

109
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,660
and a garbage fire,

110
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,830
but of course it was yielder raise money
and he had every right to spend it.

111
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,390
However you wanted shoulder rate began
paying for his own personal chapel on his

112
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,980
estate.
This might seem strange,

113
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:49,490
but it wasn't actually that uncommon for
members of the European ability to have

114
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:51,290
their own church back in the day.
This way,

115
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,170
he could still attends mass and do
it from the comfort of his own home.

116
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,980
It was called Chapel of the holy
innocence named after a Vus in the book of

117
00:06:57,981 --> 00:06:59,510
Matthew.
In this Vus,

118
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:02,930
King Herod orders a mass killing of
all children under two years old.

119
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,370
It's prevent a prophecy from coming true
that a child would grow up to overthrow

120
00:07:07,371 --> 00:07:10,440
him. From a modern perspective, it
seems rather creepy. That shields array,

121
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,900
which wants a church named after a
story about the murder of thousands of

122
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,650
children. But some historians say
that it's exactly the opposite.

123
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,670
In the 14 hundreds the story actually
became popular among the French Catholic

124
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:23,270
community.

125
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,960
People when they hear a comparison to the
tragedy of these dying children in the

126
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:28,450
Bible to the hundred years war,

127
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,410
because the entire generations of people
who grew up without knowing a time of

128
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,550
peace, it was finally the coming
in vogue to be a pacifist.

129
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,610
By naming his personal church,
the chapel of the holy innocence,

130
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:44,120
he was actually making a political
statement that he wanted the hundred years

131
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:45,500
war to be over.

132
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,670
Considering that many of
the noble families profited
from constant warfare into

133
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:50,870
capturing territory's.

134
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,020
This was even more reason for
is in most to be angry with him.

135
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,860
The Duke of Brittany appears before the
pipe claiming that the shoulder ray had

136
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:59,210
an addiction to spending money.

137
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,750
He requested that the pope would deny
his application to have the chapel of the

138
00:08:02,751 --> 00:08:07,190
innocence accepted as an official part
of the Catholic diocese that you coped.

139
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,910
There's a rejection would be enough to
stop childer ray from completing the

140
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:13,370
chapel,
but he went ahead and built it anyway,

141
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,480
even though his judge did not have a
real Catholic priests that to say mass

142
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,340
shoulder rate didn't let that stop him.

143
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,870
He has Taylor's custom meg lavish and
colorful costumes for him to wear and he

144
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,460
officiated mass himself.

145
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,390
This was considered to be extremely
blast from us since he was making it very

146
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:34,391
public statement that he knew that he had
just as much power as the king and the

147
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,550
Catholic Church and there was pretty
much nothing they could do to stop him.

148
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,840
His family met with the king asking
for a royal decree to stop anyone from

149
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,180
entering into a contract with Jill duray.

150
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,240
They claimed they were afraid he would
spend all of his money and that there

151
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,070
would be nothing left in his estate.

152
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,820
Thinking agreed to announced the Duke
of Brittany to take control over.

153
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:57,030
[inaudible] is a state that you have
Brittany making financial decisions on his

154
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:00,710
behalf and he completely cuts off
shoulder ray from all of his money often

155
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,400
looking over his financial records.

156
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,180
The Duke told Jill to ray that he had
spent everything he owns and that he was

157
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:09,750
now in debt, so therefore began
sending his properties one by one.

158
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,660
Lisa shoulder rate nuns.

159
00:09:11,661 --> 00:09:14,530
There's one of his favorite castles
that the DEU could apparently sold,

160
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,740
was actually being gone by a
Catholic clergyman named Joel,

161
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,090
and if they're wrong and no one
was actually living there at all,

162
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,300
he was incredibly angry about this.
He wasn't going to stand for the Duke,

163
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:28,620
trying to make him both penniless and
homeless. He wanted to go back inside,

164
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:32,820
so he beats and kidnaps Jonah for wrong
in order to get the new keys to the

165
00:09:32,821 --> 00:09:35,580
castle, get nothing, get a clergyman.
It was a very serious crime.

166
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:38,940
He did eventually let the man go,
but in the eyes of the Nobel community,

167
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,510
it was extremely shocking that
shoulder a would do such a thing.

168
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:45,330
It was becoming clear to
both the king and the pub.

169
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:48,210
The Jill [inaudible] was not
going to go down without a fight.

170
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,670
He was so powerful.

171
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,460
He could get away with just about
anything and stay out of jail.

172
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,210
The French people loved him for being
a hero and for his generosity to the

173
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:01,470
peasant classes if he wanted to. He even
have the ability to raise his own army.

174
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,620
This was a very scary thing for the powers
that be and they need to stop it now,

175
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:09,990
just before we get into the dark about
of this story where he apparently started

176
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:10,830
killing people,

177
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:13,440
I do want to tell you about today's
sponsor and I know they're having the

178
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:15,720
sponsor in the middle of the video
is not the most awesome thing,

179
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:19,230
but these videos are very long and
given the length that we put out,

180
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:23,070
I really hope you do appreciate the need
to put the sponsorships in the middle,

181
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,360
but I will keep it super brief.

182
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,300

184
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,900

beautiful template that comes with the

185
00:10:33,901 --> 00:10:36,930

making everything super easy to manage.

188
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,050
I want to feel through these
super easy customization process.

189
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,490
There's no updates and patches,

190
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,760
none of that stuff you have to deal with
when you're making a website on another

191
00:10:50,761 --> 00:10:53,790
platform. You know all that
super frustrating stuff. Look,

198
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,400
All right,
let's talk about some killing

199
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,121
shoulder raise.

200
00:11:23,121 --> 00:11:26,420
Family began circulating rumors
that he had gone mad and that he was

201
00:11:26,421 --> 00:11:29,660
experimenting with Alchemy.
Even if this was true,

202
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:33,440
alchemy was very misunderstood.
This wasn't a form of witchcraft.

203
00:11:33,441 --> 00:11:36,740
It was actually a very early
form of chemistry. Years later.

204
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,250
Other monikers like Queen Elizabeth the
first would hire alchemists as well,

205
00:11:40,251 --> 00:11:41,810
but according to this rumor,

206
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,440
he was taking those outcomist
practices one step too far,

207
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,730
taking them into the coals and that it
actually sold his soul to the devil.

208
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,720
He partnered with an Italian
man named Francois [inaudible].

209
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,730
He was really meant to
also be an alchemist.

210
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,050
Some even say that the two men were in
a forbidden romantic relationship and

211
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,200
that they both attempted to
summon a demon named baron.

212
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,990
They said the baron would be
able to make goals up here.

213
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,000
How to thin app off to trying three
times and failing Francois per last.

214
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,790
He apparently told shoulder ray theirs.
If they wanted to make the spell work,

215
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,240
they would need to be human sacrifice.
As the story goes.

216
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,440
Shoulder Ray Lewis children to his
counsel with the goal of killing them in a

217
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:23,110
ritualistic sacrifice in the 15th century,

218
00:12:23,111 --> 00:12:26,200
children would walk the streets
alone and go missing all the time.

219
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:30,030
We now know that young kids should
never walk up city streets unsupervised,

220
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:33,610
but at that time parents
wanted someone else to blame.

221
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,920
When that child disappeared back then,

222
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,820
it was impossible for people to fathom
that even Catholic priests were actually

223
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:43,690
Peter Fallacy where responsible for many
of the disappearances for the citizens

224
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,580
of a deeply religious Catholic nation,

225
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:49,360
it was actually easier for people to
believe that one devil worshiping serial

226
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:52,930
killing alchemist was responsible for
the deaths of all the missing children in

227
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:55,120
France.
According to the storage builder,

228
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:59,050
Ray would bring in young boys to the
console with the promises of making them

229
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:03,730
his page or his squire on and to have
their son walk with one of the most famous

230
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:06,600
nights in the country and they wouldn't
think twice about letting their son

231
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:10,270
leave with a stranger on a horse. The
boy, however, I'd never come back.

232
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,630
The coal claims that he would decapitate
the children collect their heads on

233
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:17,500
stakes and Oscar's house guests, which
one they thought was the most beautiful.

234
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,250
He agree with Todd of collecting heads
and began sacrificing these children on a

235
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,300
satanic alter,

236
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,110
allowing the rotting bodies to pile up
and sometimes burning the corpses in the

237
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:26,944
fireplace.

238
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,560
After he was accused of worshiping Satan
and killing children or shoulder ray

239
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:32,680
and all his servants denied the claims.

240
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,340
His friends also came
forward and testified on his
behalf saying that this was

241
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:40,150
all a lion, that they never saw
anything at all like that in his castle,

242
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,320
but that testimonies,

243
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,770
they were left out of the trial
after enduring physical torture.

244
00:13:44,771 --> 00:13:48,600
They finally signed confessions to a
story that had been written about that

245
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:51,040
crimes, the Oms, these signs, confessions.

246
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:55,300
There was never any physical proof
that any of this actually ever happens.

247
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,810
In 1440 childer ray was convicted
of witchcraft and Mehta.

248
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,630
He was executed on October
the 16th of that year.

249
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,780
The Duke of Brittany gains control over
all of his money and land and divided as

250
00:14:05,781 --> 00:14:06,640
among his family.

251
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,060
The king even gave them permission to
take possession of any former lands that

252
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,280
had been sold to pay for
Joel to raise depths.

253
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,880
The Catholic Church also got a huge
chunk of money from this donation.

254
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:19,120
Some say that Jill to raise his
body was burned after hanging,

255
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:22,660
which was the procedure for anyone
accused of witchcraft. However,

256
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,860
the Gutenberg project,

257
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:27,700
which studies various witchcraft cases
throughout history says that they found

258
00:14:27,701 --> 00:14:30,250
evidence that he was actually
given a Christian burial.

259
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,000
This was kept a secret because
it would prove that the cloud,

260
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:36,850
she completely made up the accusations
of witchcraft and devil worship.

261
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:40,330
This story, it was so shocking and
salacious among the French people.

262
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,070
It was hard to believe that anyone could
make up such a story about anyone to

263
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:48,550
then it felt like they were duped into
trusting a wolf in sheep's clothing.

264
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,130
The story was told over and over again
and it just became a part of French

265
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:55,910
folklore. The story sends the message
that with enough money and enough power,

266
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,980
they are a stock cracy.

267
00:14:56,981 --> 00:15:01,220
You can get away with anything and that
the common people must seek justice for

268
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:02,030
inequality.

269
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:05,840
Hanging shoulder ray became like a
victory for the people and the peasant

270
00:15:05,841 --> 00:15:09,830
classes and many people still believe
to this very day that the story they've

271
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,450
been told is the truth.

272
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,930
While it's true that shoulder
ray confessed to the murders,

273
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,430
it was only after torturing him and
threatening to excommunicate them from

274
00:15:26,431 --> 00:15:29,670
France. They never discovered any
bodies of children on his property,

275
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,990
even if they were burned,

276
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:34,500
that would still be bone fragments
somewhere that all of the evidence,

277
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:37,980
it was circumstantial and it would
never hold up in a court of law.

278
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:42,660
Today in 1992 the New York Times reported
about the possibility of reopening the

279
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:46,470
case of shoulder re. Many
French historians got very
defensive about the case,

280
00:15:46,471 --> 00:15:50,280
saying that he was truly an awful serial
killer and that it's not possible that

281
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,210
anyone would be falsely accused of
something so horrific. For years,

282
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:58,530
a woman named Margo Kgb collected nearly
every book that had been published with

283
00:15:58,531 --> 00:15:59,940
information about shoulder rape.

284
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:04,530
She went as far as to
translate the original trial
documents from Latin and read

285
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:06,870
all of the biographies in
both French and English.

286
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,680
She even discovered that the transcripts
were also altered after the trauma was

287
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:14,370
over changing children. Ray's testimony
to sound even more over the top,

288
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,420
adding even more gruesome details to his
supposed confession about slaughtering

289
00:16:18,421 --> 00:16:19,110
children.

290
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:23,610
Juby wrote her own biography on shoulder
ray and held a public retrial on his

291
00:16:23,611 --> 00:16:26,790
behalf. She proved that if
the same trial happened today,

292
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:30,450
they would never be enough evidence
to convict him of Metta. For some,

293
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:32,970
this was enough to efficiently
exonerate him. For others,

294
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,840
they will never be able to let go of
the idea that [inaudible] was one of the

295
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:41,250
worst serial killers who have lived.
So I hope you found the video interesting.
