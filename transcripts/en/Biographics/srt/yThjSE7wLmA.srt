1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,370
You had a boyish smile,

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:01,941
rebellious,

3
00:00:01,941 --> 00:00:02,631
hostile,

4
00:00:02,631 --> 00:00:03,140
Amzie,

5
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:03,681
lilting,

6
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:04,970
Liverpudlian accents.

7
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,810
It's genius.

8
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,410
It extended beyond the
music to words play ends,

9
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,350
visual arts.

10
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,060
Are you excited and inspired?

11
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:15,590
TMZ frightens parents and pastors and
two is eight target of the Nixon era.

12
00:00:15,591 --> 00:00:16,424
FBI,

13
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,250
who was this British feed on?

14
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:19,551
Well,

15
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,160
that would be the inimitable John Lennon

16
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,590
with bombs falling around the hospital.

17
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:43,080
John Lennon was born on October the ninth
1940 in the midst of World War team.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,840
His mother Julia gave him the middle
name at Winston in honor of Britain's

19
00:00:46,841 --> 00:00:47,770
leader at the time.

20
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:48,550
His father,

21
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:48,970
Alfred,

22
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,490
who was a merchant marine
and was absent at John's.

23
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,890
Beth Messi would be for
much of John's childhood.

24
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,970
Lennon's childhood was unsettled with
an absent father and a mother who simply

25
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:01,000
couldn't handle motherhood
after the age of four.

26
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:03,670
Leonard didn't even live with his
mother and instead of living with this

27
00:01:03,671 --> 00:01:05,860
childless uncle George and aren't many,

28
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,730
the two where a stern but loving
influence on Lennon at throughout his

29
00:01:09,731 --> 00:01:10,540
childhood,

30
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,410
though many did what she
could to discourage lemons,

31
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,253
love of music.

32
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,060
It was she who famously told him,

33
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,770
because I was all very well John,

34
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,900
but you'll never make a living out of it.

35
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,660
Lennon's mother was more
supportive of his musical interest.

36
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:23,290
In fact,

37
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,370
it was jr who bought the guitar for him
though then and didn't live with his

38
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:27,671
mother.

39
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,180
He remains close to her regularly visiting
our house where the two we'd listen

40
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:34,900
to Elvis records and
pluck cords on the Banjo,

41
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,740
Ukulele and the guitar.

42
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,550
Juliet was also a frequent visitor
at her sister's house where she spent

43
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:43,540
mornings drinking tea with many and
chatting with our son after one of these

44
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:44,440
tranquil visits.

45
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,131
Unfortunately,

46
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:49,240
tragedy struck as Julie across the street
to had home one day she was struck and

47
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:50,650
killed by a passing car.

48
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,640
John was 16 years old when his mother
died and he carried the weight of the

49
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:56,590
tragedy with him for the rest of his life.

50
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,460
At the time,

51
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,293
Julia died.

52
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,100
[inaudible] was already
having trouble in school.

53
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,240
He was smart,

54
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,530
no doubt about that,

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,260
but his wit and attitudes got
him into trouble with teachers.

56
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,220
He created comics of teachers and
fellow students in a worky titles of the

57
00:02:09,221 --> 00:02:09,610
daily.

58
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,270
How and detention sheets from Courtney
Bank high school show that Lennon at once

59
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:17,050
received three to technicians in one
day with offenses over the years,

60
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:21,790
ranging from fighting in class to
sabotage to just no interest whatsoever.

61
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,410
While he was goofing off in school,

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,990
Lennon was paying close
attention to his music.

63
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,890
Lennon was playing in a band called the
Quarrymen and it was one of this band's

64
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:33,520
gigs that would ultimately lead
to the formation of the Beatles.

65
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,930
On July the sixth 1957 the
Quarrymen played the Wilton
village fate and it's one

66
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:41,930
of Lennon span mates decided Lennon should
be introduced to a friends of his as

67
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,340
well.

68
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,180
He wants that friends.

69
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,540
Well,

70
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,373
you might've heard of him,

71
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,160
that friends.

72
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,780
What was Paul Mccartney that day?

73
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:47,381
Mccartney,

74
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,790
who was two years John's Jr taught
Lennon at how to tune a guitar.

75
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,870
He's impressed him with
a rendition of the song,

76
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,900
20 flights rock the atmosphere
of the day stock with Paul,

77
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,840
even if the exact year
didn't I Walton village fate,

78
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,560
I him,

79
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,320
I was a fan of school boy and
he leans in arm and my shoulder.

80
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,610
I realized he was drunk.

81
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,900
We were 12 then,

82
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,580
but in spite of his sideboards,

83
00:03:06,581 --> 00:03:07,450
those sideburns,

84
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,670
we went on to become teenage pals.

85
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:13,500
It was only two weeks before Paul was
asked to join the Quarrymen bands.

86
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,200
He agreed.

87
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,130
Shortly thereafter,

88
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:18,760
Paul introduced to John and the other
band members to his friend George

89
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,030
Harrison.

90
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,470
It was 1958 and three of the four
Beatles had already found each other,

91
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,500
but music couldn't be John's only focus.

92
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,120
Though we had failed his exams.

93
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:32,230
Upon leaving high school Lennon's arms
and former headmaster pulled strings and

94
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,290
persuaded the Liverpool College of art
to accept the rambunctious team did show

95
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,010
incredible promise in the arts.

96
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:43,850
Then started attending the livable college
in art in the fall of 1957 I'll ended

97
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
and fare much better in art school
than he had in traditional school.

98
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,400
Though he did meet his first wife,

99
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,700
Cynthia pal Len.

100
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,080
Ernie never had the rise equipment
for his classes and there was always

101
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:54,520
borrowing pals tools.

102
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,550
It was also up to pal to help
lend and through his exams,

103
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:01,660
which she ultimately fails for all the
help she gave him and was not a kind and

104
00:04:01,661 --> 00:04:02,830
loving boyfriends upheld.

105
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,641
In fact,

106
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:05,260
he could be downright abusive.

107
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:09,670
Even acknowledging as much by nature
saying I was sort of in a blind rage for

108
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,540
two years.

109
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,980
I was either drunk or fighting.

110
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,610
It had been the same with
other girlfriends out hat
it was something the matter

111
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,090
with me.

112
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:20,710
That relationship lasted though and in
1962 pal discovered she was pregnant with

113
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:24,370
Lennon's childs and keeping with the
expectations of the time the two were

114
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:27,070
married in a simple civil
ceremony in Liverpool,

115
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,791
Lennon's music.

116
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,510
Korea had already taken priority over
all else by this point and they skipped a

117
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:34,330
honeymoon so he could play a
Gig the night of their wedding.

118
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,490
Cynthia gave birth to Julian Lennon in
1963 and with the Beatles Star on the

119
00:04:39,491 --> 00:04:40,360
rise in Liverpool.

120
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,490
John didn't pay much attention to his son.

121
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,091
In fact,

122
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:46,480
his relationship with his son where is
no better than it was with his wife.

123
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:50,140
Something Julian publicly and
angrily spoke about as an adult.

124
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,860
He stated dad could talk about peace
and love out loud to the world,

125
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,640
but he could never show it to the people
who supposedly meant the most to him,

126
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,840
his wife and son.

127
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,410
How can you talk about peace and love
and have a family in bits and pieces?

128
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,670
No communication.

129
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,420
Adultery,

130
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,140
divorce.

131
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,980
John was the only married and the only
one with the child and the group's

132
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:13,000
manager trying to keep this information
about Lennon underwraps as he marketed,

133
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,030
the group girls wanted their
pop stars to be single and cute,

134
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,953
not married.

135
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,030
The Beatles rise to fame
began at the Calvin club,

136
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,660
but it was interspersed with performances
in Germany along with Lennon Mccartney

137
00:05:31,661 --> 00:05:32,950
and Harrison bandmates,

138
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,210
Stu Sutcliffe and Pete best made up the
bands lineup for their infamous stays in

139
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:37,720
Hamburg,

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,850
Germany at the Kaiser Keller Club.

141
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:40,361
The boys,

142
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:45,310
no more than 22 and Giorgione 17 lived
in horrid conditions and survived on only

143
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,080
pills and alcohol during their state,

144
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,160
but the audiences,

145
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,030
they loved them,

146
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:51,100
especially Lemons onstage antics.

147
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:51,641
One night.

148
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,900
He was supposed to be on stage,

149
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:56,320
but instead was fooling around with a
woman and the two only broke up when the

150
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:56,990
clubs bounce.

151
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,400
It dumped cold water on them.

152
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,730
Instead of getting dressed to go onstage,

153
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:03,530
letting them grabbed his guitar
and joined his band mates.

154
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,700
Are you wearing underwear?

155
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,030
Indeed.

156
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,620
Toilet seat around his neck.

157
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,420
When the Beatles returned to livable,

158
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,310
then resumed playing at the Calvin Club.

159
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,390
They caught the attention of a young
record store owner in the area familiar

160
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:16,340
with the group from their
visits to his store.

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,300
Brian Epstein went to one
of their performances where
he saw that potential and

162
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,920
signed on as their manager.

163
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,430
He got them a record contract and it
was by their side until his death.

164
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:30,431
In 1967 Epstein was gay and homosexuality
was still illegal in England during

165
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:32,540
the 1960s over the years,

166
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:36,320
rumors have persisted that Lennon Epstein
had an Afab and largely stemming from

167
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:36,951
a vacation.

168
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:41,540
The two took together in Spain in 1963
male weeks after his son was born.

169
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,430
London deny the room is saying,

170
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,090
I was on holiday with Brian Epstein in
Spain where the rumors went around is

171
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:48,650
that he and I were having a lover fat.

172
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,730
It was almost a love affair,

173
00:06:49,731 --> 00:06:50,570
but not quite.

174
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,800
It was never consummated,

175
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,110
but it was a pretty intense relationship.

176
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,830
I only 1964 the Beatles were
hitting the airwaves in America.

177
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,270
Then on February the seventh 1964 their
plane touched down at the newly renamed

178
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:04,340
Kennedy Airport in New York City.

179
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,260
Crowds of teenagers greeted them,

180
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,490
hanging over the railings,

181
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:11,750
screaming and waving signs when they made
their way through the crowds to speak

182
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:12,440
to the press,

183
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,090
Lennon treated the American media
to a dose of his classic West.

184
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,580
When a reporter asked why people
love the Beatles so much and replied,

185
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,520
if we knew we'd form another
group and to be managers.

186
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:23,390
Two years later,

187
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,830
the lads from Liverpool made their first
appearance on the Ed Sullivan show.

188
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,340
As the studio audiences screamed and
73 million Americans watched from home.

189
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:34,160
The Beatles performed five
songs during the show.

190
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,990
Each Beatles name appeared on the screen.

191
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:38,420
Then Ann's name had an
addendum though it red,

192
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,350
sorry girls.

193
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,150
He's married.

194
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,490
Keith think Cynthia and
Julius existence quiet.

195
00:07:42,491 --> 00:07:45,830
It was not possible for a man who
was about to become one of the most

196
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:48,260
recognizable people in the world.

197
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,580
1964 it saw the release of
both the movie and the album,

198
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,690
a hard day's night marking all four
Beatles foray into the film industry.

199
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,230
Lennon would later repair and satirical
film called how I won the war,

200
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,130
not to be constrained by only two
artistic mediums then and also published a

201
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:14,550
book in 1964 in titled in his own right,

202
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,750
which he later followed up with the
volume entitled a Spaniard in the works as

203
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:23,070
the 60s continued on that these all
stayed at the top of the pop culture world

204
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,150
and that's high profile meant that or
Lennon's mouth can get him and the band

205
00:08:27,151 --> 00:08:28,620
into trouble pretty easily.

206
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:33,120
In 1966 he famously told a reporter
that the Beatles were more popular than

207
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:33,954
Jesus.

208
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,310
When the remark was published,

209
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:36,630
it caused an uproar.

210
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,040
Socorro's beetle burnings were held around
the United States during which teens

211
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,840
and their parents burned albums,

212
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:53,180
photos and other Beatles memorabilia.

213
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,480
1967 was the year that the Beatles took
a rock and roll to new heights with a

214
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:01,920
release of sergeant pepper's lonely
hearts club band psychedelic concept album

215
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:05,370
that featured a collage of historic
figures and celebrities on its cover.

216
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,180
Initially Jesus where it's supposed to
be among those pictured in the artwork,

217
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,820
but after Lennon's 1966 remarks,

218
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:13,650
he was removed from the Ra,

219
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:17,850
one of the songs on sergeant peppers
with Lucy in the sky with diamonds and it

220
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:21,420
has long been thought to be drug related
as the major words in the title or

221
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:23,130
create the acronym Lsd.

222
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,600
However,

223
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,100
Lenin said that his inspiration
for the songs imagery,

224
00:09:26,101 --> 00:09:28,440
it came from one of his
favorite works of literature,

225
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,650
Alice in Wonderland.

226
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,940
The overall idea stemming from one of
Julian's challenge had drawings of a

227
00:09:32,941 --> 00:09:35,310
school friend named Lucy
during this time period,

228
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:39,120
Landon and began moving and avant garde
artistic circles primarily due to his

229
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:40,740
new relationship with artists,

230
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,610
Yoko Ono.

231
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,690
He had met ono,

232
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,690
which one of her gallery shows and at
the time that they're meeting consisted

233
00:09:45,691 --> 00:09:49,190
solely of her handing him a card
that said nothing but breathe on us.

234
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,170
Let them,

235
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,570
we're still married to Cynthia.

236
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,231
He had don't know,

237
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,820
began spending time together.

238
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,350
Even recording an album calls two virgins
that featured both of them standing

239
00:09:58,351 --> 00:09:59,680
fully nude on the coverup.

240
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,570
Lennon and Cynthia did not officially
divorced until 1968 though the

241
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:06,390
relationship between Ono
and Lennon was well known.

242
00:10:06,391 --> 00:10:06,811
We don't know.

243
00:10:06,811 --> 00:10:10,530
Spending time in the recording studio
is the Beatles worked and even lend her

244
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:15,531
voice to the white album song bungalow
bill in 1969 Lennon and oh no married in

245
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:19,380
a ceremony at the rock of Gibraltar and
events that was famously chronicled in

246
00:10:19,381 --> 00:10:19,920
the song,

247
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,540
the ballad of John and Yoko.

248
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,560
It goes like this and no,

249
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:25,260
I'm not going to try and sing it cause
you really don't want to hear that.

250
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,030
Finally made the plane into Paris.

251
00:10:27,031 --> 00:10:30,300
Honeymooning down by the Sen
Peter Brown called to say,

252
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,021
you can make it.

253
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,680
Okay,

254
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,990
you can get married in
Gibraltar near Spain.

255
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,200
While that wedding was a
relatively isolated fat,

256
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,570
they welcomed the wells
to their honeymoon.

257
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,340
Yoko and Lennon set up camp in a bed in
the Amsterdam Hilton in order to promote

258
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,080
world peace lying in bed,

259
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,730
fully clothed for a week.

260
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,310
They repeated this done two weeks later
in Montreal and it was at the Montreal

261
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,370
bed in that they recorded give peace,

262
00:10:53,371 --> 00:10:57,030
a chance surrounded by members of the
press and other friends and followers.

263
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:01,410
By this time that Lennon was fully
dedicated to his life with Ono and each of

264
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,110
the Beatles had started to
move in their own directions.

265
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,160
I know his presence in the
recording studio mentor in Bhutan,

266
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,800
the music,

267
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:07,980
uh,

268
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,860
because of the other Beatles.

269
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:12,390
And so they also had begun
exploring different artistic worlds.

270
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,630
The disintegration of the
world's most famous bands.

271
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,260
Well,

272
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,093
it had begun.

273
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,400
Lennon was the first of the Beatles to
tell them that he was leaving the group.

274
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,510
And he did this in September of 1969
but it was Paul Mccartney who broke the

275
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:26,520
news to the world publicly
that he was leaving.

276
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,980
And the beetle officially
split on April the 10th 1970

277
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,690
though he had left the Beatles behind.

278
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,850
Lennon did not abandon music.

279
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,020
His first post Beatles album was
released in 1970 with many of the songs

280
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:49,270
inspired by the primal scream therapy.

281
00:11:49,271 --> 00:11:52,420
He had began practicing as a method
of dealing with the trauma he had

282
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,830
experienced his childhood.

283
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,550
The song that perhaps most demonstrates
the influence of primal scream.

284
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,270
There's mother,

285
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,560
which includes the lyrics.

286
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,160
Mother,

287
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,881
you had me,

288
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:01,930
but I never had you.

289
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,860
I wanted you.

290
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:03,940
You didn't want me,

291
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,730
so I just got to tell you goodbye.

292
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,420
Goodbye.

293
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,370
By the time lending released
his next solo album,

294
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,911
he ends,

295
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,271
oh no,

296
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,170
we're living in the United States
settling into the luxurious Dakota or

297
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:15,910
apartment building in New York City.

298
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,780
It was here that he wrote the most iconic
of his solo works and that would be,

299
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,940
imagine the song as the album.

300
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:25,150
There were huge hits in nearly
40 years after Lennon's death.

301
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:28,240
The song remains an international
anthem of peace and love.

302
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:28,941
Now let her,

303
00:12:28,941 --> 00:12:29,021
no,

304
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:29,201
no,

305
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:29,411
no.

306
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:31,240
They enjoy living in New York City,

307
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:35,710
but the US government did not enjoy
having the counter culture icons in the

308
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,510
midst of the largest American metropolis
in 1972 18 year olds would have the

309
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:43,210
right to vote for the first
time and 18 year olds.

310
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:46,990
They listened to John Lennon when they
sang and spoke about the evils of war and

311
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:50,590
the actions of the government that
made him a threat to Richard Nixon's

312
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:55,570
reelection and in 1972 the government
revoked Lennon's visa based on these

313
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:56,140
fears,

314
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,800
but they threatened his deportation and
not wanting to be separated from owner.

315
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,610
Lennon essentially stopped
his involvements with
counter cultural activities,

316
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:08,110
but as threats of deportation continued
then and was forced to hire attorneys

317
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:10,450
and continuously appeal
to stay in the country.

318
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,620
In 1976 only after the Nixon presidency
fell apart under the pressure of

319
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:15,280
Watergate,

320
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:19,180
did Lennon receive his green card and
we're safe to stay in the United States

321
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,130
during this struggle to
obtain his green card.

322
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,970
Lennon was also struggling with his
relationship with the team essentially

323
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:29,110
separated for over a year and it's Lennon
even moved out to California to live

324
00:13:29,111 --> 00:13:31,750
with a former secretary
may Pang with whom?

325
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:31,961
No,

326
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:32,111
no.

327
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:36,010
Had encouraged him to begin a relationship
lender later referred to this period

328
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:41,011
of his life as the last weekend as it was
fueled by alcohol and drugs and marked

329
00:13:41,141 --> 00:13:42,970
by aggressive behavior from Lennon.

330
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,520
He wants even trying to strangle pang
and it's got thrown out of a club fed

331
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,810
drunkenly heckling the smothers
brothers from Lennon's absence.

332
00:13:49,811 --> 00:13:52,240
I know realized that she
needed him in her life.

333
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:56,340
She ultimately came to blend society's
pressures and not him telling playboy.

334
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,820
John was a fine person.

335
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,740
It was society that has become too much.

336
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:03,610
I'm thankful to John's intelligence that
he was intelligent enough to know this

337
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:05,920
was the only way that we
could save our marriage.

338
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,030
Not because we didn't love each other
better because it was getting too much for

339
00:14:10,031 --> 00:14:10,330
me.

340
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,380
When the two reunited,

341
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,760
I knew quickly became pregnant.

342
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,750
She gave birth to you,

343
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:18,730
Sean Lennon on John's 35th birthday on
October the ninth 1975 with the birth of

344
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:22,780
Sean came a sea change in Lennon's life
where he had been an absent father to

345
00:14:22,781 --> 00:14:23,380
Julian.

346
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,580
It was a doting father to Shawn giving
up a music and instead spending his time

347
00:14:27,581 --> 00:14:28,490
as a house husband.

348
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,680
Let an also began spending time with
Julian again during the 1970s Julian

349
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:37,210
visited New York and then taught his first
son guitar techniques for five years,

350
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,040
then focused on domestic life,

351
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,100
but by 1980 he felt the
tug of the artistic muse.

352
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:42,934
Once again.

353
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,230
He began writing songs,

354
00:14:44,231 --> 00:14:45,160
recording an album,

355
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:49,630
and officially reentering the music scene
with the release of double fantasy in

356
00:14:49,631 --> 00:14:53,060
the fall of 1980 John
Lennon while he was back,

357
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:55,983
Huh?

358
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,200
Well,

359
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,470
it was not to last two months after
double fantasy was released then.

360
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:07,550
No,

361
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:07,691
no,

362
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:07,921
no,

363
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:08,131
no.

364
00:15:08,131 --> 00:15:12,150
Headed to the recording studio to work
on new songs that they had written on

365
00:15:12,151 --> 00:15:16,710
their way to the studio and then stops
to sign a copy of double fantasy for Mark

366
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:16,910
David Chapman,

367
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:19,890
a fan who is waiting outside
the Dakota on their return.

368
00:15:19,891 --> 00:15:24,110
Shortly before 11:00 PM Chapman was still
waiting outside the Dakota building as

369
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:24,361
the lender.

370
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:24,471
No,

371
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:24,631
no,

372
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:24,841
no.

373
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:25,890
Walked by Chapman,

374
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,030
pulls a gun and fired five
shots at Lennon and hysterical,

375
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:29,341
oh No.

376
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,290
Called for help and the NYP d arrived.

377
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,980
Officers loaded the winded Lennon into
the back of a cruiser and drove him to

378
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:36,120
the Roosevelt Hospital.

379
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,481
Well,

380
00:15:36,481 --> 00:15:37,170
their efforts,

381
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,003
they were fruitless.

382
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,180
John Lennon was declared dead on arrival
at 11:00 PM December the eighth 1980

383
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,080
the United States had the news viral
Monday night football broadcast and the

384
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:49,410
news quickly made it to the rest of the
world's crowds began to show up at the

385
00:15:49,411 --> 00:15:52,740
Dakota singing Lennon songs and
carrying signs in his memory.

386
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,480
No funeral was held instead.

387
00:15:54,481 --> 00:15:54,781
Oh No.

388
00:15:54,781 --> 00:15:57,960
How does body cremated and
scattered his ashes in central park,

389
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,270
the location now called strawberry fields,

390
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,290
is a memorial dedicated to Lennon
that is visited by legions of fans.

391
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:04,950
Every year.

392
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,640
John Lennon's public life was dedicated
to art and the promotion of peace,

393
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:12,210
but his private life was quite a
bit more complicated and dramatic.

394
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:15,570
What is certain is that there is no doubt
that he holds a special place in the

395
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:17,790
lives of those who grew
up with him and his music,

396
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,810
as well as the children and grandchildren
of those baby boomers who have come to

397
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,670
love his music and his legacy.

398
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:28,440
A groundbreaking musician and experimental
artist then turned his private pain

399
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,670
into beauty for the world.

400
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:34,110
His legacy has lived on for decades after
his death and surely will continue to

401
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:36,050
live on long after we're all gone.

402
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:37,770
So I really hope you found
this video interesting.
