1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,760
Hi was pile the top of the head often
ornamented with jewels or trinkets.

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,810
Her face was always made up and she
wore the finest gowns and jewelry.

3
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:09,640
I was only 19 years old.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:13,210
She was already a queen and then the
tumultuous times in which she lived,

5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,990
she soon became a symbol of all
that was wrong with French royalty.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,250
So in the video today,

7
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,780
let's explore the life of Mariam's.

8
00:00:19,781 --> 00:00:24,520
When asked the woman who was the
face of rail access during the French

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,353
revolution

10
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,910
then now inextricably linked
with France and so on.

11
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:44,630
It wasn't a native of the country,

12
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,800
descended from the Habsburg line as
she was born into royalty in Austria.

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:53,180
Marie Antoinette's entered the world in
1755 she was the daughter of the empress

14
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:56,540
of Austria and the holy Roman
emperor like many born into royalty,

15
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,590
she had a lengthly name,

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,270
Maria Antonia Josepha.

17
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,530
Joanna growing up,

18
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:02,420
she was educated by private tutors,

19
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,480
are education focused on
morality and religion.

20
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,780
This was typical at the time for
an aristocratic females education,

21
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,320
though she had a private tutor that
works with her aunts when I was new,

22
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:13,970
great shakes at academics.

23
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,490
In fact,

24
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,760
she could barely read and
write her native German,

25
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,340
much less the French that
she also had to study.

26
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,080
As one of her tutors described.

27
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,720
She is rather lazy and
extremely frivolous.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,770
She is hard to teach on swing as
agree off during the seven years' war.

29
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,570
She was only eight years
old when it's ended,

30
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:33,800
but the outcome of the conflict quite
seriously effected how future you see.

31
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,170
As the empress of Austria,

32
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:38,150
I was going to its mother where's the
political leader at the end of the seven

33
00:01:38,151 --> 00:01:38,750
years war,

34
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:42,620
it was in her best interest to keep
an alliance between the French and the

35
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:44,630
Austrians ends in the 18th century.

36
00:01:44,631 --> 00:01:47,030
The best way to forge an
alliance was three marriage,

37
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,160
two years after the war
ended when Antoinette,

38
00:01:49,161 --> 00:01:50,360
who is but 10 years old,

39
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,960
her mother pegs the 11 year old ads to
the French crown was at best about for a

40
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:54,770
son in law.

41
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,530
The necessary arrangements were amazing.

42
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,540
Does the age of only 14 Antoinette was
married off into foreign royalty to Louie

43
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,630
or Gusta ball ball.

44
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,450
Marie Antoinette's entry
into France as a teenager.

45
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,200
It was a spectacular affair.

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,350
A caravan was made up
of nearly 60 carriage is
accompanied by 117 footmen ends

47
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:26,120
at 376 horses.

48
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,080
The destination for this variable
parade was a royal retreat in the forest

49
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,220
outside of Paris,

50
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:34,190
but they had to make a stop as they
approached the border with France.

51
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,100
Antoinette had to be dressed to
look the part of French royalty.

52
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,180
I was pal does,

53
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,110
her makeup was done,

54
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,650
and she puts on a dress that matched
the lavish expectations of the French

55
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:43,100
court.

56
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,933
When they arrived,

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,280
Antoinette's showed herself
to be just a teenager.

58
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,390
She was impulsive ends,

59
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,150
unable to control her excitement
about being in a new place,

60
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,050
about some meters,

61
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,340
seemed to be husbands
rushing out of the carriage.

62
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:56,090
She dashed up to the King of
France and when she curtsied,

63
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,170
he was charms,

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,340
but the king's grandson.

65
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,530
The future events,

66
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,010
when ads did not share his birth
through extroverted personality,

67
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,230
he did not die shop to
her around her arrival.

68
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,771
Instead,

69
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,550
he aversion desires gave her a quick
formal kiss on the cheek and then stage

70
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,270
silence.

71
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,850
Meanwhile,

72
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,590
[inaudible] and the king chattered away
merrily one day off to Antoinette's as

73
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:14,891
mess.

74
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:18,970
Louie the t were married the May
the 16th 1770 wedding ceremony.

75
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,480
It was held in the chapel of the famed
palace of Versailles and it's when it's

76
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:26,470
addressed was white and silver
opulence gown dax out in diamonds,

77
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,640
but there was a major problem with the
gown that it wasn't the right size for

78
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,220
any bride.

79
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,940
Discovering on your wedding day
that your dress doesn't fit well,

80
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:35,110
it would be a nightmare,

81
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:39,130
but imagine being the future queen with
all eyes of the court and the country

82
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:39,964
upon you.

83
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,230
She didn't refresh,

84
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:41,740
however,

85
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,090
at least not publicly.

86
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,350
She was expected to walk down the aisle
and take the hands of Louis Bull on in

87
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,020
marriage,

88
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,020
so that's what she did with our chef
showing through the back of her dress in

89
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,000
between rows of stone diamonds.

90
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,210
The ceremony itself was a long mass
and the grievant huddle on a dower

91
00:03:55,211 --> 00:03:56,860
expression for the entire time.

92
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:00,520
Then when it came to seal the contract
with the signatures of the bride and

93
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,160
groom Antwon as drip to
ink on the signature,

94
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,330
obscuring the name.

95
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,930
Doing so was considered bad luck
for the marriage and things.

96
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,890
While they didn't get any better,

97
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,820
as the day went on,

98
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,240
it was traditional in this era of a
newlyweds to be followed to their bed

99
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,440
chamber by a crowd.

100
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:15,830
In the case of Amazon,

101
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:16,421
as in Louie,

102
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:19,510
the crown's included royal
dignitaries and an arch Bishop,

103
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,500
the bishop gave the blessing and the
crown dismissed as the couple disappeared

104
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,170
behind drawn curtains and they undressed,

105
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,590
but as it would seem the entirety of
Europe and the next day they didn't

106
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:33,970
actually consummate the marriage as was
expected of newlyweds and indeed for the

107
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:35,110
next seven years.

108
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,490
They didn't consummate the marriage.

109
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,150
To this day,

110
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,660
there's never been a clear answer to why
it took so long for the two to fulfill

111
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:42,010
this marital obligation.

112
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,790
Historians have put forward theories to
of those popular theories are that Louie

113
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,640
had phimosis they condition the men.

114
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:51,340
Sex was painful for him or it's simply
that the two teenagers were just young

115
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,174
and it's confused,

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,480
but it did seem that the whole world knew
about the lack of intimacy between the

117
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:57,460
young royals and cleaning Antoinette's.

118
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:01,300
Mother and [inaudible] mother regularly
corresponded via letter and their

119
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,140
discussions offer a glimpse
into Antoinette's early
years in the French court

120
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,870
and these reveals that
she was very homesick.

121
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,441
Madame,

122
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,400
my very dear mother,

123
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,390
I have not received one of
your dear letters without
having the tears come to my

124
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:17,710
eyes and she disliked to the French
customer royalty being attended to always.

125
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:21,100
I preserve my rouge and wash my
hands in front of the whole world.

126
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,850
She complained to her mother in a letter
I love that spent time in her letters

127
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:28,570
admonishing her daughter for her frivolous
behavior at court as well as for not

128
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:30,430
performing and Marisol obligations.

129
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,320
In one letter she told Angela ads there's,

130
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:33,610
in order to be a good wife,

131
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,910
she needed to to lavish
more caresses on Louis.

132
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,980
Part of the problem might have been there.

133
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,630
Different schedules and lifestyles,

134
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,320
big married.

135
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,350
They lived two very different
lives and so when as was,

136
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:46,090
as are going and just social as ever,

137
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:47,710
there's a husband's remained quiet,

138
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,450
avoiding the frivolities of course life
that his wife so enjoyed the differences

139
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,070
they graded on the marriage.

140
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,540
And so when that wrote to her friends,

141
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:59,960
my tastes are not the same as the kings
who is only interested in hunting and

142
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,070
his metal working.

143
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,390
He would often go to bed
well before midnight while
she was just getting started

144
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:07,040
with her parties late into the night.

145
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,250
Then she'd wake up late morning after
I'd already been up attending to his

146
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,500
duties or studies from an early hour.

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,530
Eventually bans when it's brother
were sent to France to talk to Louie.

148
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:18,230
It's not clear what ends when
his brother said to Louie,

149
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,760
but after that chat the couple was
finally able to consummate their marriage.

150
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,010
By the time of their
marriage was consummated,

151
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,870
Louis' father had died and the two had
been king and queen for three years and

152
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,960
at this point she was just 21 years old

153
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,200
as Queen Antoinette's
tastes remains lavish much.

154
00:06:46,201 --> 00:06:49,620
Do you have mother's dismay and it almost
pretentious letter her mother rose,

155
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,570
you lead a dissipated life.

156
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,920
I hope I shall not live to see if
he disaster that is likely to ensue.

157
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,570
A hair itself was saying,

158
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,881
mark,

159
00:06:57,881 --> 00:07:01,590
if our opulence with wigs
and ornamentation piled
feet at all of the heads,

160
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,580
I was silly,

161
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,990
extravagantly done that she could even
honey to tiny visas of water in this.

162
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,370
Do you keep the ornamental flowers fresh?

163
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,473
Leonard Audi,

164
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,210
a hairdresser became a
cultural icon in his own right.

165
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,870
The women of the courts and of high
society in Paris began emulating

166
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:17,010
Antoinette's hairstyles.

167
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,000
With morning women.

168
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,800
Even going so far as do ornaments,

169
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,810
their towers of hair with earns her
jewelry was also flashy to have a diamond

170
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:25,321
bracelet.

171
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:29,940
It's well worth as much as an entire
mansion in Paris just getting dressed in

172
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:30,240
the morning.

173
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,250
Was it literally a production?

174
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,600
One of Ann's when it's maids,

175
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:37,200
would hold up a book of fabric samples
for her to help her decide what to wear.

176
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,150
Then she'd put on layers of undergarments,

177
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,020
including a frame.

178
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,360
If I'm the has scars it
to emphasize her hips,

179
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:42,781
of course,

180
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:43,291
it of course.

181
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:46,020
Then layers of fabric
and then her dress again.

182
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,270
Mother did predictably and not approve.

183
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,991
As you know,

184
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,800
I've always been of the opinion that
fashion should be followed in moderation

185
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,960
but should never be taken to extremes.

186
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,220
A beautiful young woman,

187
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,360
a graceful queen,

188
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,370
has no need for such madness.

189
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,120
On the contrary,

190
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,690
simplicity of dress is more of a
fitting and it's more worthy of a queen.

191
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,780
I love my little queen and watch
everything you do and feel.

192
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:10,560
I must not hesitate to draw your
attention to this little frivolity.

193
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,350
The royal couple was living
well and to showing it off,

194
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,950
but the people of France weren't sharing
and the opulence and it's not all of

195
00:08:16,951 --> 00:08:17,850
the French population,

196
00:08:17,851 --> 00:08:22,440
was impressed with their new queens
luxurious style in the late 1770s the

197
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:23,340
harvest in France,

198
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,330
it wasn't going well.

199
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,290
Green was it a premium prices were
skyrocketing and farmers and peasants,

200
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,153
they were hurting.

201
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,950
They were literally riots
in the street over Brett.

202
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,210
It is during these rights.

203
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,030
That answer now is we're supposed
to have said let them eat cake,

204
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,470
but you never actually said this.

205
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:41,550
That phrase was attributed to her much
later in 1843 aunts when has may have

206
00:08:41,551 --> 00:08:43,920
never uttered that
famously callous phrase,

207
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,220
but she certainly wasn't sympathetic
to the plights of the peasants.

208
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,820
In fact,

209
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,410
even as as subjects with suffering,

210
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,570
she continued spending even more.

211
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,351
She gambled down.

212
00:08:52,351 --> 00:08:56,670
She spent money to construct her own
private retreat at the building known as

213
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,080
the trine on already existed.

214
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,420
That's when I though she
needed to make it her own.

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,070
She installed artificial rivers,

216
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:05,700
the Rotunda and a series of what
appeared to be in rustic cottages.

217
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,150
Once inside it became clear they weren't
anything but they were furnished in the

218
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:10,920
typically comfortable
style of the wealthy,

219
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,330
complete with pool tables,

220
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,111
silk hangings,

221
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:16,890
and other ornate wall Waldeck or fine
China in luxury furniture broads the cost

222
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:21,760
of the retreat to an astounding 2 million
francs beyond the cost of the decker

223
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:22,500
and the property.

224
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,340
The triathlon also caused other problems
for Antoinette's among her subjects.

225
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,340
People wondered why a Queen
would need such a retreat,

226
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,370
so they jumped to conclusions and
began spreading rumors and gossip.

227
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,000
The Queen,

228
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,170
she was hosting men.

229
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,770
They said,

230
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,170
I've seen gatherings that to
be happening at the Trianon.

231
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,010
Why else would she need a lavish getaway
for just herself and to have friends?

232
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,210
One rema,

233
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,010
it persisted and that was a vans.

234
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:48,690
When it's a fan with the Swedish diplomat
axle to fasten it in 2016 a team of

235
00:09:48,691 --> 00:09:50,310
researches announced their Dakota.

236
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,390
The latter that showed Antwon ads and the
person's relationship went beyond just

237
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:58,080
discussing matters of state among
Vindico did passages is this,

238
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,490
I will end this letter.

239
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,090
There's knots without telling you my
dear and gentle friends that I love you

240
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:06,690
madly and that there is never a
moment in which I do not adore you.

241
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,520
The two that first been introduced in
1774 and saw each other more and more as

242
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,030
fascinating,

243
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,670
did more events at the French course.

244
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,800
You'd have to Europe for a time to
find in the American revolution,

245
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,750
but that didn't,

246
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,950
didn't the feelings between
him then Antwon apps,

247
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,060
another letter that survived the centuries
has first and telling his sister that

248
00:10:24,061 --> 00:10:27,360
he could never marry because there's
one true love was already taken.

249
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,210
The Queen,

250
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:28,551
I'll shoot.

251
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:31,920
We're certainly giving the people
of France a great deal to talk about

252
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,700
discussions of Antwon out as eight
traitors and our husbands and about half

253
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,750
frivolity with money.

254
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,520
We're spreading pamphlets distributed
throughout France drawings an answer and

255
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,000
as a company to set up words,

256
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,770
shoving her in extravagant dresses.

257
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,580
This very great ire towards her
and the rest of the royal family

258
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,270
as the king and queen were acting as
if nothing was different about life.

259
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,200
The people of France,

260
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,150
we're getting angrier band Sangria.

261
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,540
In 1789 king Louie had
sent troops to a science.

262
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,860
Paris and French citizens were starting
to worry it might be a move to dissolve

263
00:11:11,861 --> 00:11:12,910
the National Assembly.

264
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,840
In response,

265
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,800
900 Frenchmen descended upon Paris
and stormed the Bastille prison.

266
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,750
They stole weapons and ammunition,

267
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:22,840
but the events was much more
than the stockpiling of weapons.

268
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,250
It was a symbol of the people being ready
to take on the powerful forces of the

269
00:11:27,251 --> 00:11:27,970
monarchy.

270
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,500
The Bastille was a fortress,

271
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,270
but it was also the prison weapon.

272
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:32,530
Critical enemies were kept.

273
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,240
It was a symbol of the Monica use power.

274
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,290
And by taking it over,

275
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,350
the people showed just how
weak the monarchy could be.

276
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:43,480
The storming of the Bastille on July the
14 to 1789 is widely considered to be

277
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,010
the start of the French revolution
and things were moving pretty fast.

278
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,671
By October,

279
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,700
the crowds of revolutionaries
and grown to thousands,

280
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,140
10,000 French has gathered outside the
PSI calling for the king and his queen to

281
00:11:56,141 --> 00:12:00,670
be dragged to Paris among them thousands
of women who had marched miles from

282
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,240
Paris.

283
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,450
And along the way they were
joined by men with guns.

284
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,740
When they showed up outside
the royal residents,

285
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,031
Lee,

286
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,260
we didn't know what to do.

287
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,970
His first instinct was to escape,

288
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:11,830
so we ordered his carriage is be prepared.

289
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,200
They were no match for the angry crowds.

290
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,710
The carriage were ruins and to Louis
and just family remains trapped in the

291
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,490
palace stay when much safer in selling
though some of the crowds trying to get

292
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:25,120
it down to an ads and they
nearly succeeded to garbs
were killed as the crowd

293
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,240
forced their way towards
our quarters and so on.

294
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:28,180
As it wasn't in the bedroom,

295
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:31,570
though she had left the air and was
safe in the dining rooms of Louise

296
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:31,630
quarter's.

297
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,140
Soon after troops under the commands of
Marquis de Lafayette arrived and were

298
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:36,250
able to restore order.

299
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,460
The piece was not to last though the
crowds were able to capture the king and

300
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:43,240
queen and forced them back to Paris in
a procession led by the heads of their

301
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:44,200
dead body guards,

302
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:47,950
which were hoisted up on Pike's
throughout the crisis Antwon when ash was

303
00:12:47,951 --> 00:12:51,640
meeting with ambassadors
and writing letters to other
European officials calling

304
00:12:51,641 --> 00:12:55,690
on them to help out the French monarchy
that we meanwhile seems it's a loss for

305
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,350
how to help.

306
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,890
Then in 1891 aided by the help of her
lover to Ferguson and not Louis and swing

307
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:04,480
that's put together plans and get the
royal family out of France and away from

308
00:13:04,481 --> 00:13:06,460
the danger of an angry at public.

309
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,530
The plan was to escape to the Netherlands
where they could plot a counter

310
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:10,330
revolution.

311
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,970
Amazon has proved herself able
to make decisions and plan,

312
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,860
but when it came time for her to escape,

313
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:16,720
her desire for luxury got in the way.

314
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,140
Again,

315
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,410
a French general had told the royals
that their journey would be much safer if

316
00:13:20,411 --> 00:13:23,260
they made it in to small
and conspicuous carriages.

317
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:23,860
Instead,

318
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,100
Antoinette's demanded that they use
larger carriages that could be outfitted

319
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:30,370
with a full silver dinner
service as well as a wine chest.

320
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,900
Also joining the royal family in their
luxurious carriage was to [inaudible] the

321
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:38,140
plan called for him to leave the royal
family a short way into the journey,

322
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,450
then meets back up with
them at their destination.

323
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,480
He wants it to to travel the whole
way as part of their group to offer

324
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:44,080
protection,

325
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,530
but Louie demanded you follow the
plan and separate from the group.

326
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,630
Shortly after the person's
departure from the group,

327
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:50,740
they ran into trouble.

328
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,160
A peasant's recognize the king and was
able to muster up the crowds to attack

329
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:54,994
for carriage.

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,280
They weren't dragged into
a house and held captive.

331
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,410
Eventually they were
allowed to return to Paris,

332
00:13:59,411 --> 00:14:01,300
but still held captive.

333
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,760
The French assembly allowed
Louie to serve as king,

334
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:05,950
but he didn't really
have any power and downs.

335
00:14:05,951 --> 00:14:06,430
When asked,

336
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:06,790
well,

337
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,100
she wasn't much in favor
of the assembly at all.

338
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,230
She was actively working against them,

339
00:14:11,231 --> 00:14:14,710
writing to officials throughout Europe
about how terrible she thought the new

340
00:14:14,711 --> 00:14:15,730
constitution was.

341
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,970
She was also pretty clear in how she
felt about the members of the assembly

342
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:19,660
themselves,

343
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,300
describing them as a heap of black guards,

344
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,920
madmen and beasts.

345
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,820
During this time,

346
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,860
Larry heard also declared war on Austria,

347
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,660
things they were falling apart all around
aunts when asked and they were about

348
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:33,460
to get a whole lot worse.

349
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:37,690
In 1792 the French royal family was
forced into the Medieval Temple Tower,

350
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,580
fortress as they were held prisoner,

351
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,850
the millennium old Monica,

352
00:14:40,851 --> 00:14:45,070
you're France was dissolved and a new
French republic took its place as all this

353
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,120
was going on outside.

354
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,510
The royal family tried to live a
somewhat normal life in prison that we in

355
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,640
Murray tutor their children
chess and played instruments,

356
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,300
but they will also trying to bring them
the backs of power and there was this

357
00:14:56,301 --> 00:15:00,110
effort that ultimately undid her and
Louie the couple that hit in the letters

358
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:02,930
they received from foreign powers
in a box inside the prison.

359
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,670
When the correspondence was discovered,

360
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,320
Louie was dragged on trial.

361
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,960
He was ultimately sentenced to death
with the revolutionary leader roles,

362
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:14,961
p APP or claiming Louie must die so that
the country may live on [inaudible] and

363
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:18,350
the children were able to spend a few
final hours with him before he met his

364
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:22,590
fate at the Guillotine with 20,000
Frenchmen looking on months later,

365
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,740
that's when I had herself would
be the one on the platform.

366
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
After Louise Execution,

367
00:15:26,001 --> 00:15:27,440
she was brought to a new prison,

368
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,940
a prison with the dire nickname of death,

369
00:15:29,941 --> 00:15:31,310
Santa's chamber here.

370
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,820
Ray sympathetic military officer actually
attempted to help her escape when his

371
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:36,040
efforts were uncovered bands,

372
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:39,760
when ash was put on trial right away
in order to avoid any danger of her

373
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:40,520
escaping,

374
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,360
she was charged with treason and theft
and it was left up to a male jury to

375
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:45,230
decide her face.

376
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,680
It only took two days for them to decide
that she was guilty and she should be

377
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,610
sentenced to death.

378
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,420
The 37 year old queen made one final
trip through the streets of Paris.

379
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:53,601
Oh,

380
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,231
how Sean?

381
00:15:54,231 --> 00:15:55,760
In preparation for execution,

382
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:59,780
she sat stoically in a carriage on the
ride to the guillotine platform where she

383
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:01,160
would ultimately meet her face.

384
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,690
When she arrived at the platform,

385
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,340
the priests told her to have courage.

386
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,300
How response?

387
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,110
Courage.

388
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,280
I've shown it for years.

389
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:07,671
Thank you.

390
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:11,420
I shall lose it at the moments when my
sufferings are to and from the moment she

391
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:11,990
was born,

392
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,290
Marie Antoinette was destined to
play a role on the world stage.

393
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,530
How mother set her up for a powerful
marriage and marriage that thrust her into

394
00:16:18,531 --> 00:16:20,000
the midst of the French revolution,

395
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,630
and it's made her the ultimate
representation of the excesses of royalty.

396
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,760
She was only alive for 37 years,

397
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,630
but in that time,

398
00:16:26,631 --> 00:16:29,390
she suddenly left her mark on the world.

399
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,950
So I really hope you enjoyed the video.
