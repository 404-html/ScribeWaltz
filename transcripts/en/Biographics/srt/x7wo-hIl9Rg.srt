1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,650
He wants the personification of the
evil dictator clad in his familiar khaki

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:07,290
uniform men's cap and chomping on a cigar.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,140
He ruled with an iron fist
over his island nation.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,070
He took on the United States and brought
the world to the brink of nuclear

5
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,904
holocaust,

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,770
shifting his attention to his own country.

7
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:17,990
He decimated the economy,

8
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:23,010
creating a communistic dictatorship that
forced the people to revere him even as

9
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:24,180
he ruined their lives.

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,770
In this episode of Biographics,

11
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,610
we take a closer look at
the life of Fidel Castro.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,530
Del Castro was born on August the 13th
1926 and the small farming village of

13
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:52,990
monogamous in northern rnt and Cuba.

14
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,940
His father and Heller caster you Gus had
emigrated from Spain in 1898 and picks

15
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:01,180
up work as a brick layer and the
railroad worker before starting his own

16
00:01:01,181 --> 00:01:03,280
business selling lemonade
to field workers.

17
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,750
From this humble start,

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,840
he built a small sugarcane embark and
praising 26,000 acres and 300 work

19
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,640
families.

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,470
And how's the first wife Maria go?

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:17,380
I gave birth to two children and then
either died or simply walked out on the

22
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:17,830
family.

23
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:18,411
Unhealth soon.

24
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,390
Took up with his young,

25
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:21,820
made leaner Roos Gonzalez who bore him.

26
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:24,820
Three children and Yella
of Amman and Fidel.

27
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,730
The couple were married
shortly after Fidel is birth.

28
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:31,480
They were a relatively wealthy family
who lived in a deletion style two story

29
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,910
house in the country still.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,940
They did live a decidedly country
lifestyle with chickens and pigs wandering

31
00:01:36,941 --> 00:01:37,720
through the house.

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,690
Fidel was named after a local
politician with his name,

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,010
meaning faithful.

34
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,360
He did have his father's temperaments,

35
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:45,790
which meant he was prone
to violence outbursts.

36
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,270
His sister recalls that if he was playing
baseball and just team we're losing.

37
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,330
He would simply gather up the
equipments and walk off the fields.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,350
Close friends and future novelist Gabriel
Garcia Marquez recalled that Fidel was

39
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,890
the worst loser that did have a
mask when he reached school age.

40
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:01,900
Fidel was sent to study and Santiago,

41
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:04,660
the second largest city in
Cuba for the first two years.

42
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:07,090
He stayed with his godparents
and was homeschooled by them.

43
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,691
After that,

44
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:11,590
he was enrolled at the Maris
Lasalle school along with
brothers Ramond and Raul.

45
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,260
Fidel soon gained a
reputation as a troublemaker.

46
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,540
I was a bit of a bullied when
he was in the fourth grade.

47
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:19,720
Fidel's father received a letter stating
that his three boys with the biggest

48
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:23,950
bullies in the entire school and how was
furious and pulled the boys out of the

49
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:24,430
school.

50
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,700
This enraged with Al who
threatened to burn the house down.

51
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,720
He ended up being sent to a more
demanding Jesuit school in Havana with his

52
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:34,920
father threatening to cut off his
allowance if his grades dropped below a

53
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,710
certain level.

54
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,830
Fidel responses to this by
forging his school reports.

55
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,860
Carsguru proved to be a
decidedly average students,

56
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,200
but there was one area
in which he excelled.

57
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,060
He had a photographic memory of facts,

58
00:02:46,061 --> 00:02:48,010
which hugely impressed
his fellow students.

59
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,941
They would call them,

60
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:50,380
do a page number from their tax books,

61
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:53,390
and he would recite the page
word for word in his team's.

62
00:02:53,391 --> 00:02:56,800
Fidel began to develop his ability as
a public speaker and there's a debater.

63
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,150
After an initial rejection,

64
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,300
he gained acceptance into the
Allover Bernardo Literary Academy,

65
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,880
which was the literary
wing at the Jesuit School.

66
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,310
At first he was paralyzed by stage fright,

67
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,240
but he gradually became more relaxed
and more confidence in his presentations

68
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,380
and obviously a very of 1945 Fidel
entered law school at the University of

69
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,470
Havana.

70
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:14,951
At the time,

71
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,000
the university was a self governing body
which for bead the police or army from

72
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:20,170
setting foot on campus.

73
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,980
As a result,

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,270
it was a hotbed of clandestine activity
by gangsters and political agitators.

75
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,960
It was a very attractive environment
for the hot headed Castro.

76
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:40,310
Fidelis first foray,

77
00:03:40,311 --> 00:03:44,930
NC political imagination was precipitated
by a rise in bus fares that had been

78
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:47,930
authorized by Cuban
precedents ram on growl.

79
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:50,970
Castro organized a protest
against the fair raisins,

80
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,790
led a march to the presidential palace.

81
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,510
The police beat the students with Fidel
himself receiving slight injuries.

82
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,740
He used this incident to his advantage
by going to the press and receiving some

83
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:01,880
sympathetic coverage.

84
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,280
At the time the Castro in
roles at the university,

85
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:07,460
there were two main gangster
groups who were vying for control,

86
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,350
the socialist revolutionary movements,

87
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,140
Msr,

88
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,040
and as the insurrection or
revolutionary union you,

89
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,640
Iowa,

90
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,340
there were frequent violent
clashes between these two groups.

91
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,460
Fidel quickly sized up the situation
and began to maneuver between the two

92
00:04:19,461 --> 00:04:20,030
groups.

93
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:24,080
In December of 1946 there
was an assassination attempt
on a leading member of

94
00:04:24,081 --> 00:04:27,230
the Uir and Castro was
fingered as the trigger man.

95
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,410
His that seem to motive here was that he
wants it to ingratiate himself with the

96
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:31,490
MSR leadership.

97
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,300
As it turns out,

98
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,710
it was the leader of Ui,

99
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:34,544
Emilio Troy,

100
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,200
who took Castro under his wing.

101
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,550
He gave Fidel the pistol,

102
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,880
which the young budding revolutionary
carries with them at all times throwing.

103
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,910
They'd been planning and invasion of the
Dominican Republic in conjunction with

104
00:04:43,911 --> 00:04:47,440
a group of Dominican exiles in response
to the terrible conditions brought about

105
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,010
by the rule of Rafael Trujillo.

106
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:53,180
Task very quickly jumps on board and sales
without 12,000 fellow revolutionaries

107
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:58,080
to Kayak on fetus on July the 29th
1947 for two months they arms.

108
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:01,310
When's paramilitary training before
setting off for the Dominican mainlands.

109
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,060
Meanwhile,

110
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,690
three Ho had learned of the plans attack
and didn't even appeal to the United

111
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:05,691
States.

112
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:06,260
For Eight,

113
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,830
the revolutionary leaders got cold
feet and cools off the invasion.

114
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:10,101
Ams,

115
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:13,820
the embarrassed given army began rounding
up the ships and taking the would be

116
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:14,930
attack is into custody.

117
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Castrate managed to evade custody by
jumping ship and swimming eight miles to

118
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,450
the shore.

119
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:25,310
In 1947 Castro visitors a new model
prison on the isle of Pines as part of his

120
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:26,144
legal studies,

121
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,780
my name or sons,

122
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,350
Havana,

123
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,040
he criticized the prison and it's
inhumane treatment of its inhabitants.

124
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,910
The following year,

125
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,760
he was part of a student
congress that traveled to Bogota,

126
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:35,420
Colombia.

127
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,510
On April the seventh the group maps
with the leader of the Liberal Party,

128
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,650
Jorge Gasten,

129
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,900
who looked likely to win
the upcoming election.

130
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,010
Two days later though,

131
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,480
Gaten was shot debt.

132
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,810
Bogota erupted in violence
and the students from Cuba,

133
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,980
we're caught in the middle of it.

134
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,520
Castro became actively involved
participating in the takeover of a police

135
00:05:52,521 --> 00:05:53,210
station.

136
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,043
After three days,

137
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,550
the authorities restored order,

138
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,020
but not before some 3,500
people had been killed.

139
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,400
Gastro returns in Havana where he
became a follower of Senator Eddie.

140
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:05,900
He bus the main opponents
of president ground.

141
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,700
He was the founder of the Cubans.

142
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,450
People party.

143
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,080
Castro campaigned hard for hibiscus and
is unsuccessful bid for the presidency

144
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:14,840
in 1948 I'm still the
two men whenever close.

145
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,600
Keep us all.

146
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,580
Fidel as somewhat of an embarrassment
user has gangsta backgrounds and Fidel

147
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,880
only ever viewed the leader as an
obstacle to his own path to power.

148
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,730
In order to gain political respectability,

149
00:06:34,731 --> 00:06:38,330
Castro cut off his association
with his gangster associates.

150
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,710
He gave speeches on campus denouncing
the two main gangs and naming names of

151
00:06:42,711 --> 00:06:44,720
those who were responsible
for criminal activity.

152
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,070
This made him a target for both groups
and he was forced into hiding around this

153
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,460
time.

154
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:49,941
Fidel,

155
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:52,070
who was generally awkward
and shy around women,

156
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,840
and that's martyr Diaz Balart,

157
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,150
the daughter of one of the
wealthiest man in Cuba.

158
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:00,620
The couple of fell in love and were
married in 1948 with motors father getting

159
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,190
them $10,000 for a three month
honeymoon in the United States.

160
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,450
Most of their time was spent in New
York where Fidel learn some English.

161
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,261
We're starting to Cuba.

162
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:12,590
The newlyweds moved into a hotel across
the street from a military camp in

163
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,220
Havana.

164
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:18,220
In September of 1949 matter gave birth
to a son who would become known as Fidel

165
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:18,680
Ito.

166
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,690
Having graduated from University of Fidel,

167
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,310
began a small law practice,

168
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,060
most of his title.

169
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:23,630
However,

170
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,630
we spent dabbling in politics on August
the 15th 1951 people's party leader at

171
00:07:28,961 --> 00:07:29,600
he hit us,

172
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,850
was giving his usual Sunday radio address,

173
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,420
urging the people to stop accepting the
corruption of the government and take

174
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:35,900
action.

175
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,170
Even pulled out a pistol and
shot himself in the stomach.

176
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,310
The dramatic act was intended to rouse
the people keep us had spoken for too

177
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:45,170
long and to suicide attempt.

178
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:47,750
It's not broadcast for the next 11 days.

179
00:07:47,751 --> 00:07:50,570
Keep us lay in a hospital
bed in terrible agony.

180
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:50,820
Oh,

181
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,410
his side.

182
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,570
The entire time was Fidel Castro.

183
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,830
When the leader died,

184
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,610
Castro was prominence as part of the
honor guard that stood outside the

185
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:00,190
university hall of Honor Work.

186
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,950
Give us in state how's the military
escorts prepared to lead the body through

187
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,450
the streets in a large procession,

188
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,350
Castro and treated the captain to divert
the root to the presidential palace.

189
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:13,280
Fidel was convinced that he could rouse
the people to overthrow the government,

190
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,380
but the army captain refused fairing.

191
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,760
There's an absolute bloodbath.

192
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,500
We didn't see him the following year.

193
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:21,380
Castro ran for a seat on
the Chamber of Deputies.

194
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,700
He managed to garner the support of the
majority of the People's Party members

195
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,070
and looked in line to when
the upcoming election.

196
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:28,431
However,

197
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,960
on March the 10th former presidents for
NCO Battista stage a military coup and

198
00:08:32,961 --> 00:08:33,360
seized.

199
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:33,830
However,

200
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,080
he began rounding up his
political adversaries,

201
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,150
including members of the People's Party.

202
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,590
Fidel and his brother Raul
went into hiding the buddies
to queue diverted Castro

203
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:46,670
from what could have been the promising
diplomatic Korea in favor of becoming a

204
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,200
fully fledged revolutionary.

205
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,090
You gathered together
his own political group,

206
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,170
drawn from former party
members and followers from
his university days traveling

207
00:08:54,171 --> 00:08:55,010
up and down the country,

208
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,420
put his oratorical lands,

209
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,820
propaganda skills to full
of facts off to 14 months.

210
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,070
He had a following of 12,000 people.

211
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,010
He ran his organization with
military precision and discipline.

212
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,000
Drinking alcohol was forbidden and
t imposed strict sexual standards.

213
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,060
He also organized his
forces at a cellular level.

214
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,900
We have members of each cell being
unaware of the existence of other cells.

215
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:30,310
By the middle of 1953 Castro had the
support base that he needed to stage his

216
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:31,000
own COO,

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,691
but he didn't have,

218
00:09:31,691 --> 00:09:34,360
there were weapons or indeed
the money to buy them.

219
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,840
His solution was to attack a
military base and sees its weapons.

220
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,990
The base selectors was located at Mancado.

221
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,531
The attack,

222
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:41,861
however,

223
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:43,090
and was bungled from the start.

224
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:46,960
One of the 26 vehicles on route to the
base had a flat tire and other took a

225
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,870
wrong turn and did not arrive
until the attack was well underway.

226
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,360
When the remainder of the
vehicles arrive to the base,

227
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:55,660
they were surprised to find it heavily
fortified the military defenders,

228
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,140
so beach back the invaders with
eight of Castro's men being killed,

229
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,093
the remains or floods,

230
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,510
but over the next few days,

231
00:10:01,511 --> 00:10:03,610
many of them were rounded
up by the authorities.

232
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,970
69 of them are eventually
tortured and put to death.

233
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,120
Castro himself was put on trial
before a military tribunal.

234
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,960
He used the opportunity to speak out
about the regime of Patista as the harsh

235
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,850
treatments of his fellow revolutionaries.

236
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,520
His courtroom defense statements
of history will absolve me,

237
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,580
which become probably his
most famous speech still.

238
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,170
He was convicted and sentenced to 15
years and imprisonments Castro and his

239
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:28,000
followers were sent to
the previous dimensions.

240
00:10:28,001 --> 00:10:29,790
Isle of Pines Prison for doubt.

241
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,520
Muse does time that as who instilled a
supreme level of order and discipline and

242
00:10:33,521 --> 00:10:34,210
as men,

243
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,930
the Castro rebels gains a reputation
for their good behavior and were given

244
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,710
great freedom.

245
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,360
Then on march the sixth 1954 Boeing's
public pressure President Battista

246
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,870
grounded amnesty to Castro and dismantle
the show of good faith from the

247
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:47,261
president's.

248
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:47,630
However,

249
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,350
did not stop Castro from
speaking out about the regime.

250
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,490
When two of his men were
beaten by Battista enforces
Fidel became increasingly

251
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:55,990
concerned for his own safety.

252
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,740
He would move houses every two to three
days and then just two months after

253
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:00,910
being released from prison,

254
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,590
he left Cuba from Mexico.

255
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,640
It was Casper.

256
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:07,990
Plan to build up and train a new wing of
his revolutionary army in Mexico and to

257
00:11:07,991 --> 00:11:12,610
then return to join forces with those
already in Havana and a huge push to oust

258
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,600
the Patista regime is Mexican army began
as a group of about 60 cube and the

259
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:20,920
factors who lived in six small houses
under strict disciplinary conditions

260
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:22,030
imposed by Fidel.

261
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,080
It was during this period that
castering that Ernesto Che Guevara,

262
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,390
who would play a key role
in the coming revolution.

263
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,750
Castro launched his
revolution in late November,

264
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,360
1956 from the port of Tox
Pan on the Mexican coast.

265
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:38,680
It was planned to coincide with another
uprising organized by a rival antibodies

266
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:42,850
to group for Dell had bought a 60 foot
boat that was designed to take a maximum

267
00:11:42,851 --> 00:11:47,851
of 25 passengers and deepen the old 82
of his men on board as it shoved its way

268
00:11:47,921 --> 00:11:48,754
towards Cuba.

269
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,190
The boat was in constant
danger of capsizing.

270
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,660
The journey was so slow that the
five day trip took seven days,

271
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,690
meaning that they would miss the uprising
of the other group with the boats

272
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:00,580
beach at a place called purgatory points.

273
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,600
On December the second,

274
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,201
but by now,

275
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:05,370
but he's designy who had already put
down the fast rebellion had landed that

276
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,070
Castro was on his way and his,

277
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:10,870
that he had planes overhead ready to
strafe the invaders and bomb the area.

278
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:15,100
Only about a dozen men survived Castro
and Guevara or among them they again a

279
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,540
three day march through the forest,

280
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:19,510
constantly being hounded from
the ad by the Cuban air force.

281
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,320
They finally reached the Sierra Maestra
region where they settled with the local

282
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:25,210
villages and began to regroup.

283
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,193
Six weeks later,

284
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,030
Castro led 33 men on a gorilla raid
on a tiny army garrison in La Plata.

285
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,870
Two soldiers were killed and the rebels
stole off with a number of weapons.

286
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,980
A month after this attack,

287
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,250
gastric decided it was time to get
its propaganda machine in motion.

288
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,850
He sent one of his men to Havana to bring
a foreign journalist back to the camp.

289
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,360
The man chosen was from the New York
Times and Suny three part story had

290
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,510
appeared in the paper describing
the massive military buildup.

291
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,940
Castro was organizing
in the south of Cuba,

292
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,930
Castro support based group exponentially
with more and more disaffected Cubans

293
00:12:55,931 --> 00:12:56,860
joining his rags.

294
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,360
In March of 1958 younger brother Raul
began to establish the second force out of

295
00:13:01,361 --> 00:13:02,110
Oriente,

296
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,370
which soon grew in number.

297
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:07,480
Raul proved to be a highly
capable military commander
with his force capturing

298
00:13:07,481 --> 00:13:08,800
and destroying many planes,

299
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,420
tanks and military vehicles.

300
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,080
In April for the cold calls upon the
people of Cuba to stage and nationwide

301
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:14,500
strike,

302
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,440
he believed that this would be the
start of his long plans uprising.

303
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:21,010
President Battista responded
by threatening to shoot
anyone who participated in

304
00:13:21,011 --> 00:13:21,610
the strike.

305
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,300
As a result,

306
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,450
more than 140 people were
shot down in the street,

307
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,040
but this action only fueled Castro support
base and it's even more people stream

308
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,490
to support him with the tight now
decidedly turned in his favor.

309
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,870
Castro decided to move.

310
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,210
He sent Che Guevara and
another of his commanders,

311
00:13:37,211 --> 00:13:40,750
Camilo [inaudible] goes on a
Westwood march towards Savannah.

312
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,190
Along with their rebel forces.

313
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,850
The government forces put up virtually
no resistance and the rebels were able to

314
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:46,601
take control.

315
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:51,370
One town after another on December the
31st 1958 with Castro's men closing in,

316
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,650
but he start resigned
and fled the country.

317
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,460
Three days later,

318
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,460
Castro arrived in Santiago
to a hero's welcome.

319
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,160
He gave a speech in
front of 200,000 people.

320
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,500
I was later Guevara or NCN for he goes,

321
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,940
marched into Havana and seized control
of the reins of power and just like that,

322
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,950
the Castro era had begun yet

323
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,090
transfer of power with amazingly orderly
Castro would want his mat and against

324
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:24,530
fluting or destroying property.

325
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,670
He had come to power on the backs of an
army of poor and illiterate peasants.

326
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,230
Now that he had gained power,

327
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,450
he would need to educate
men to help him govern.

328
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,381
He tries to a point,

329
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,310
his former professor,

330
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,870
Jose Miro Cardona as prime minister,

331
00:14:36,871 --> 00:14:39,230
Renzi Manwell Aricia to be president.

332
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,690
He made himself supreme commander of
the armed forces behind the scenes.

333
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,250
However,

334
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,170
gastro put the organization in place to
ensure that he was the holder of overall

335
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,070
power in the weeks
following the revolution.

336
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,590
More than 500 Patista
officials were tried,

337
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,543
convicted,

338
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:53,443
and put to death.

339
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:57,650
That number would rise to
1,900 over the coming year.

340
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,480
Within seven months of seizing power,

341
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,630
Castro decided that he no longer had
any need for a public governments.

342
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,760
On July the 16th,

343
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,520
he announced that he was resigning his
position as on Monza because he could no

344
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:08,900
longer work with precedent.

345
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,480
[inaudible]

346
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,850
he had accused him of corruption.

347
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:13,370
Castro then disappeared
for a number of days.

348
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,030
Justice Fidel had intended the people
who rose up in protest and demanded that

349
00:15:17,031 --> 00:15:20,450
the president must go the fries and
the president sought sanctuary in the

350
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,580
Venezuelan embassy before
escaping the country.

351
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,810
This allowed Castro to resent it in
triumph and to point himself as President

352
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,380
Castro.

353
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,390
Now in post totalitarian rule,

354
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:32,000
those who did not give
him that absolute support.

355
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:36,470
We're in danger of being seized and
put on trial or just simply shot.

356
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,760
Within a few short months,

357
00:15:37,761 --> 00:15:39,620
all signs of resistance within Cuba,

358
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:40,880
including critical media,

359
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,260
had simply been removed.

360
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:42,531
Now,

361
00:15:42,531 --> 00:15:46,280
Castro fixed his attention on
securing external security.

362
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,441
Uh,

363
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:50,240
focus was perched on increasing the
size and the strength of his army.

364
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,950
Six months soft up seizing power,

365
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,790
Castro and visited the United States where
he was greeted with enthusiasm by the

366
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,940
media as well as politicians and
the public behind the scenes.

367
00:15:58,941 --> 00:15:59,450
However,

368
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,500
the Eisenhower governments was already
making plans for Castro's removal

369
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:17,390
in February of 1960 the Cuban leader
signs and agreements with the Russians by

370
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:20,570
which Cuban sugar would be
traded for military arms and oil.

371
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:24,350
This was at the height of the Cold War
and many of the oil refineries in Cuba

372
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,280
where American owns when the owners
refuse to process Soviet oil imports,

373
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,140
Castro sees their businesses.

374
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:34,130
The U s government responded by cutting
700,000 tons from the U S and your

375
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:38,030
purchase commitments intern at Castro
nationalized Usi and its agriculture and

376
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,140
industrial businesses.

377
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,900
Castro has move,

378
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,780
had a huge impact on the u s mafia,

379
00:16:41,781 --> 00:16:44,330
which would cost about a hundred
million dollars worth of property in the

380
00:16:44,331 --> 00:16:45,590
tourist industry alone.

381
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,690
During this period of nationalization,

382
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,910
more than 200 thousands
professional and upper costs,

383
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,190
citizens fled the country.

384
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,790
Relations between the United States and
Cuban government's became so strange

385
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:59,990
that in March of 1960 President Eisenhower
greenlit the training of a group of

386
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:03,380
Cuban exiles to stage an
invasion and seek control.

387
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:07,910
The bowl was picked up by President
Kennedy resulting in the disastrous Bay of

388
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:08,744
Pigs invasion,

389
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,520
gastric gusts of winds of the invasion,

390
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,750
and how does forces ready and waiting
with their lack of promised USS support.

391
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:19,870
The Cuban rebels cut to pieces on
December the first 1961 Castro when's on

392
00:17:20,601 --> 00:17:24,440
national television and Declan's that
he was a Marxist Leninist and would be

393
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,640
until the day he died.

394
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:29,450
The Soviets took eight where he view of
their newly declared communist fellow

395
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:34,150
that the Americans responded immediately
imposing a total economic blockade from

396
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,790
Cuba.

397
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,900
This led to economic disaster with
massive food shortages resulting.

398
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,471
Finally,

399
00:17:39,471 --> 00:17:41,810
the Soviet government
decided to embrace Castro.

400
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,330
They offered to station Soviet
missiles on the islands.

401
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,950
In Middle October,

402
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:49,040
1962 the American government's got
concrete evidence of the missile operation

403
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,110
leading to what became known
as the Cuban missile crisis.

404
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,310
Resident Kennedy placed a total military
blockade around Cuba and announced that

405
00:17:56,311 --> 00:18:00,840
a military attack from Cuba on any nation
would be seen as a direct attack by

406
00:18:00,841 --> 00:18:03,180
the Soviet Union on the United States.

407
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,840
Castro urged the Russians to make a
preemptive strike on the United States if

408
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:11,070
the Americans attacks the islands after
13 days during which the world was a

409
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,200
hair trigger away from
nuclear destruction,

410
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,380
the Russians backed down and
agreed to remove the missiles.

411
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,490
Castro was left completely out of the
negotiation process and he was not happy.

412
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,480
Soviet president's,

413
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:25,650
Nikita Khrushchev tries to placate him
by inviting Castro on a 40 day trip

414
00:18:25,651 --> 00:18:26,640
through the Soviet Union.

415
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,541
During the trip,

416
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:31,170
Khrushchev offered to provide economic
aid to the struggling islands.

417
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:35,100
In 1965 the United States announced
that it was willing to take in Cuban

418
00:18:35,101 --> 00:18:35,850
refugees.

419
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,850
This led to a mass exodus with a result
in huge loss of skills and manpower on

420
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:41,694
the island

421
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,480
with international situation and having
settled Castro satisfied [inaudible] on

422
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:58,420
making agricultural reforms
to improve the economy.

423
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,350
He wants to increase the sugar harvest
and set a target for national production.

424
00:19:02,351 --> 00:19:07,351
In 1965 5.5 million tons increasing
to 10 million tons by 1970 these

425
00:19:08,621 --> 00:19:09,371
expectations,

426
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:09,910
however,

427
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,770
they were totally unreasonable still,

428
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,550
he paused nearly all of the country's
economic resources into the sugar cane

429
00:19:15,551 --> 00:19:16,210
industry,

430
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:18,250
leaving all other economic activity.

431
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:18,820
Baron,

432
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,630
the whole country,

433
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,620
including the elderly,

434
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:24,040
young children and military workers
were put to work in the fields in a

435
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,290
desperate quest to reach his targets.

436
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,670
Even Castro himself,

437
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,430
we sent two of cut cane
for four hours every day.

438
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:31,810
How's the rest of the Cuban economy?

439
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:36,640
It fell by 20 and 40% the sugar cane
project failed dismally to reach its

440
00:19:36,641 --> 00:19:37,780
projected targets.

441
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:42,160
In 1970 Castro announced that the plant
had failed typical of his flat for the

442
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:42,910
dramatic.

443
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,230
He resigned his presidency.

444
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,610
The people demanded that he returned and
soon he was back in power and the sugar

445
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,870
crisis was behind him.

446
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:54,280
Throughout the 1970s Castro began
looking for ways to extend his influence

447
00:19:54,281 --> 00:19:54,850
abroad.

448
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,510
He began involving himself
in revolutionary movements
and sending forces to

449
00:19:58,511 --> 00:20:00,700
train and lead various
guerrilla operations.

450
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,420
It's supportive.

451
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,230
Civil wars in Angola and Somalia ate
up more of his countries with limited

452
00:20:05,231 --> 00:20:06,064
resources.

453
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,300
During the early 1980s sugar prices and
production has increased significantly.

454
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,220
This allowed the Cuban economy to grow
at a rate of 24% but when the sugar price

455
00:20:15,221 --> 00:20:16,150
slumped dramatically,

456
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:19,930
Cuba's international debt
ballooned to $6 billion.

457
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:20,741
At the same time,

458
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:23,770
it's still owed $19 billion
to the Soviet Union.

459
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,940
The Soviets trying to help by increasing
trade with the fall of the Soviet

460
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:27,941
Union.

461
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:30,400
In 1989 all the agreements fell apart.

462
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,580
The already week you've been
economy was severely restricted.

463
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:35,230
Strict to rationing was put in place.

464
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,790
The electricity supply became sporadic
and tractors were replaced with ox drawn

465
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:42,340
carts where there's country
on the brink of collapse.

466
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,240
In 1993 Castro Cubans to
start private businesses.

467
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:46,970
The following year,

468
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:49,960
he permitted foreign investors
to own given businesses as well.

469
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,590
If the economy which had declined
by 40% in the past three years,

470
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,390
finally began to grow.

471
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,480
By the 1990s castrate was an aging
isolators and largely depressed dictator.

472
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,150
The majority of his close associates
were either dead or had been exiled.

473
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,570
He still keeps up his habit of staying
in one place for any two or three nights,

474
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,350
so he was constantly being moved around
and a bulletproof Mercedes limousine

475
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:24,900
during this period of Castro's tight
grip on the country seems to loosen

476
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,460
slightly,

477
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,390
but then in March of 2003
he imposed a crackdown,

478
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,200
which Sol scores of journalists,

479
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:30,950
students,

480
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,800
and professional people arrested
us dissidents of the regime.

481
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,450
In July of 2006 the 80 year old Castro
underwent surgery for internal bleeding.

482
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,410
The following year he handed over the
presidential rents to his brother Raul.

483
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,230
From then Fidelis health grants
relate to Terrie right it.

484
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,910
The ends finally came on November the
26th of 2016 though the exact cause of his

485
00:21:49,911 --> 00:21:51,320
death was never released.

486
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
The country was in mourning for nine days.

487
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,930
