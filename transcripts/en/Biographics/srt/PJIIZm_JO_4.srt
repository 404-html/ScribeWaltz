8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,560
Liar does some males.

9
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:22,160
It on was a much loved revolutionary
hero who saved China from the rule of

10
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:23,210
foreign aggresses.

11
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:27,110
He multiplies China by bringing the ones
as of western industrialized nation to

12
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,520
their shores to others.

13
00:00:28,521 --> 00:00:33,440
Though he is remembered for
being a sociopathic Tyron
to sacrifice the lives of

14
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:38,441
millions of people in order to bring
his political experiment to life.

15
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,070
In the video today,

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,900
the life of the chairman,

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,720
a farmer and land owner named
Malley Chan was a self made man.

18
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,920
He was born into poverty,

19
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:03,820
but he worked hard and saved enough
to buy two acres of rice patties.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,600
Over the years he employed workers
tens the lands for him and most of his

21
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:10,060
profits went back into expanding his farm.

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,480
He builds a comfortable life for his
wife when she may and their future

23
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,080
children.

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,621
Sadly,

25
00:01:14,621 --> 00:01:18,280
his wife had difficulty getting pregnant
and she lost her first two children

26
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,150
during infancy.

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,360
She gave birth to her only child
mouths and Dong in 1883 growing up,

28
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:27,820
Mousa Dong lived very comfortable
life compared to his peers.

29
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,200
It was not uncommon for Chinese children
do walk around without shoes and wear

30
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,820
clothes that were in tatters.

31
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,870
They barely had enough food to eat and
they could not afford proper healthcare.

32
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,620
The fact that males are dongs parents
could afford to provide all of the basic

33
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:45,700
necessities for their child is why some
people considered them to be wealthy.

34
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,660
The one thing that Mouser Dong had in
common with all of the children in China

35
00:01:49,661 --> 00:01:54,280
though was that he was taught the
religion and philosophy of Confucianism.

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,000
One of his most well known teachings is
that everyone should try to go with the

37
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,020
flow means balance,

38
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,690
the energy of ying and Yang.

39
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,950
When it came to the government,

40
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:07,510
Confucius said that people should try to
be satisfied with their lot in life and

41
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:11,410
they should know their place in
order for society to run smoothly.

42
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,390
Confucius says there is governments when
the prince is Prince and the minister

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,291
is minister.

44
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,101
When the father,

45
00:02:18,101 --> 00:02:18,934
his father,

46
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,050
and the son,

47
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,093
his son,

48
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,150
however males are Dong,

49
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:24,370
did not agree with
everything Confucius taught.

50
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,211
After all,

51
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:29,740
he knew from firsthand experience that
his father was able to work his way out

52
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:30,574
of poverty.

53
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,230
He wanted to believe that he could grow
up to be more than just a farmer's son

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:35,950
in school.

55
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,280
Males that Dorman was one of the top
students in his class and he loved reading

56
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:42,110
as many books as he could
get his hands on butts.

57
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,420
At 13 years old,

58
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,081
his parents,

59
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:47,980
they removed him from his elementary
school in order to help his father work on

60
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:48,640
the farm.

61
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,810
His father tried to arrange a marriage
with a young girl named [inaudible] who

62
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,480
was the daughter of a nearby
farmer and land owner.

63
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,050
This would have ended his education
and completely sealed his fate.

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,530
He refused to marry
hard at 16 years of age.

65
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:06,430
He convinced his parents that he wanted
to be an intellectual and his parents

66
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:10,000
agreed to send him to a boarding
school and the city of Chang sharp.

67
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,140
When he was in this city,

68
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:15,670
he met other blank minded people who
believed that there was a need to change

69
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:18,640
the Chinese way of life
in the 18 hundreds China,

70
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:23,641
we're seeing more and more trade from
western countries from 1842 1842 Cheyenna

71
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,814
in Great Britain.

72
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:29,620
They had a big conflict known as the
opium wars and it's trying to lost.

73
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,300
After signing the treaty of Nanking,

74
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:35,410
Hong Kong became a British territory
and European traders now had access to

75
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,490
Chinese ports.

76
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,170
Even though this one's a peace treaty,

77
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,820
the Chinese people nicknames this,

78
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:44,440
the unequal treaties because it appeared
as though the Ching Dynasty was bowing

79
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,670
to the demands of Great Britain.

80
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,730
China was far from being
an industrialized nation.

81
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,400
That technology was so far
behind the rest of the world.

82
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,430
It was far too easy for western
countries to take advantage.

83
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:58,990
In 1895 Japan attempted to overpower
China and ran their influence over Korea

84
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,900
and this was known as the
first sign Japanese war.

85
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,360
The Cherry on top of an already bad
situation came in the year 1908 when the

86
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,360
emperor passed away.

87
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:11,860
I'm the only male out of the Ching
Dynasty was a two year old named per year.

88
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:16,300
It's not a surprise that people began to
lose their faith in the strength of the

89
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,940
dynasty in 1911 and Mouser
dawn was 18 years old.

90
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:23,380
The in high revolution happens and the
People's Republic of China broaden ends

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,490
to the Ching Dynasty

92
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,420
off the switching to
the People's republic.

93
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:36,230
The overarching government with calls
the Kuomintang also known as the

94
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:38,210
nationalist party or the KMT.

95
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,700
The Kuomintang allowed warlords to
rule over their perspective territories

96
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,543
across China.

97
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,310
Each warlord had the power
to create their own laws,

98
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:47,450
charge taxes,

99
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,950
and raise their own armies as a
university student mows it on.

100
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:52,640
His favorite subject was philosophy.

101
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:56,180
He read the wealth of nations by
Adam Smith and the spirits of laws by

102
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:56,870
Montesquieu.

103
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,130
He also read all of the works
of the Chinese revolutionaries
who were behind the

104
00:05:01,131 --> 00:05:02,000
People's republic.

105
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:02,961
During this time,

106
00:05:02,961 --> 00:05:04,930
he created the Association for Students,

107
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:08,900
self government and said who non fast
normal university so that students could

108
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,630
have a voice to protest
against the school rules.

109
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,880
He also formed a student volunteer army.

110
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,080
The Greeks had around 80 members and
they all shared their ideas on government

111
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:18,914
and philosophy.

112
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,970
It was during this time that Mouser don
was introduced to the work of Karl Marx.

113
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:25,220
Out of all the political
philosophies they studied,

114
00:05:25,221 --> 00:05:28,490
he and his friends agreed
with the ideas of communism.

115
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,810
This was because it promised that every
person in society would have their basic

116
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:37,250
needs met now's it don't continue to
excel in school and he was number three in

117
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:38,450
his graduating class.

118
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:42,410
He got a job at Beijing University as a
librarian where he was able to read as

119
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:44,090
many books as his heart desired.

120
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:49,390
The Communist Party of China or CCP was
established in 1921 one of the founders

121
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,790
lead does how was a librarian
at Peking University.

122
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:54,680
The other was Chen duck sue,

123
00:05:54,681 --> 00:05:58,760
who was an intellectual who had been a
part of the People's Republic of China.

124
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,781
After seeing how,

125
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:03,680
trying to adjust to the new republic
docs who believed that the warlords were

126
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,160
taking advantage of the peasant class
and that the political system needed

127
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,940
adjusting,

128
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,210
he thought communism would actually
be better for that society.

129
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,480
Now's the Dong was just 28 years old
at the time and he was one of the many

130
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:18,230
young people who began attending
communist meetings after work.

131
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,710
Once people began to learn about
the teachings of Karl Marx,

132
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:24,230
the Communist Party of China
gains a huge following.

133
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:28,370
Many peasant people were unhappy with
their respective warlords and they wanted

134
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,050
a new system of governments.

135
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:30,550
Of course,

136
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,910
communism was posing a huge threat to the
nationalist party and like the rest of

137
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,080
the parties in the republic,

138
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:40,760
communism actually had the potential
to spread across the entire country and

139
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:42,710
replace them as the leading party.

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,910
They believed it was time to get rid
of the communists in China before they

141
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:48,380
gains too much power.

142
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,150
In 1927 and gang working for the KMT
attacked and killed members of the

143
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,340
Communist Party,

144
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,260
or they announced the plan to eradicate
every single member of the CCP.

145
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:00,350
This events is remembered as
the Shanghai massacre role.

146
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,351
The April the 12th patch over 300,000
communists were killed and 50,000 people

147
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,580
denounced fat party
affiliation out of fear.

148
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,270
The Shanghai massacre is credited
with starting the Chinese civil war.

149
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,780
Since the KMT was the original
party of the Republic of China,

150
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,920
they felt that it was time for them to
eliminate the feudal system of warlords

151
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:26,950
and the communists as well in order to
unite all of China under one government.

152
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,470
In 1931 when Mouser Dong was 48 years old,

153
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:39,560
he was elected as the chairman
of the Communist Party.

154
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:44,150
In 1934 the Chinese civil war was still
raging on miles and on led the members

155
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:47,480
of the Communist Party and what
is remembered as the Long March.

156
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:52,540
They tracked over 4,000 miles through
mainland China in their attempts to fend

157
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,780
off KMT forces.

158
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,670
The leader of the Nationalist Party,

159
00:07:55,671 --> 00:08:00,410
Chiang Kai Shek was sending troops
after the communists and he ran several

160
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:05,060
campaigns and his attempts to defeat them
mows the dawn did not have an army as

161
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,110
large as the KMT,

162
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,050
but he had his charisma
wherever they went.

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,950
He used his power of persuasion to
tell the villages that communism would

164
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,420
improve their lives.

165
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:17,030
He promised them that they
would never go hungry again.

166
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:20,870
People are so unhappy living under the
rule of their warlords that it wasn't

167
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:24,980
very hard to convince people to fight
for the cause after losing thousands of

168
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:28,850
men and battles that don would just
restock his army with new peasants in the

169
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,490
next village and just
keep on marching forward.

170
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,930
In 1937 all of China would have to hit
pause on their civil war because Japan

171
00:08:35,931 --> 00:08:39,230
was taking advantage of the
chaos by invading Manchuria.

172
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,600
This was known as the
second Sino Japanese war.

173
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,171
For years,

174
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,930
Japan was attempted to take
over Chinese territories.

175
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,651
The Japanese,

176
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:46,281
they tortured,

177
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:46,671
they killed,

178
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:51,440
they raped Chinese civilians everywhere
they went and decimated the Chinese

179
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,370
major cities,

180
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,260
the armies of the warlords in the KMT,

181
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:55,094
they were already a,

182
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,140
from the losses they sustained
while fighting each other.

183
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:02,070
There was no way they could fend off
the Japanese empire on their own.

184
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,460
The leader of the KMT Chiang Kai Shek
had to swallow his pride and ask the

185
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,900
Communist Party for help if they're
red army was growing in numbers.

186
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:13,740
They defended China against the Japanese
and what is known as the hundred

187
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,790
regiments offensive.

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,660
The Red Army was largely made up of
peasants who didn't have time for proper

189
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,560
military training,

190
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:22,080
so mouser on used
guerrilla warfare tactics.

191
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,460
They also called in some help of the
USSR who closed in on Japanese occupied

192
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:27,990
Manchuria from the sidewall.

193
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,580
China is on the other.

194
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,740
They succeeded in saving the country.

195
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,310
However,

196
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,660
once the Japanese were gone,

197
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,703
the civil war,

198
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:39,460
it was back in 1946 miles a dog and
his Red Army defeated the Campti and it

199
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,220
became the new rulers of China.

200
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,031
At this point,

201
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:46,280
people for Mouser Dong was a national
hero and the rightful leader of that

202
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:46,920
country.

203
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,110
Not only did he save
them from the Japanese,

204
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:51,630
but the also unified the
country under one rule.

205
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,520
For the first time
since the Ching Dynasty,

206
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,600
people were hopeful that things would
finally start to change for the better,

207
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,960
but actually they were going
to get a whole lot worse.

208
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:10,330
In 1958 miles are Dong
officially began his plan.

209
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,000
This was called the great leap forward.

210
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,800
This was his attempt to use communist
ideals to bring modern industrialization

211
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,760
to China.

212
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,770
He might've had the best
intentions at heart,

213
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:25,300
but may matter how many books one may
read about creating a new society.

214
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,010
There is a huge difference between theory
and actually doing something in real

215
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:30,820
life.

216
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,940
The greater need forward created a
major land reform where citizens,

217
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:36,070
we're no longer allowed
to own private property.

218
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,250
Farmers had to give up their lands
to the greater good of the public.

219
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,510
They still have to work,

220
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,510
but they were not allowed to keep the
food they were growing because the rules

221
00:10:43,511 --> 00:10:48,130
dictated that people who were far more
important to society deserve nourishment

222
00:10:48,131 --> 00:10:51,760
first and that the peasants could
be fed with whatever was leftover.

223
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:55,950
He sent medical services do all Chinese
villagers ensuring that all of the

224
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:59,290
citizens have healthcare and they
were fit enough to do manual labor.

225
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,041
He commands it.

226
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:04,120
Many of the people of
China to start constructing
factories and new governmental

227
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:04,954
buildings.

228
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,590
Most peasants weren't farmers their
entire lives and they had no idea how to

229
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,880
work in a factory.

230
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:10,361
Still they,

231
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:14,440
they were expected to produce steel
and other industrialized materials.

232
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:17,110
There were so many people
now working in factories.

233
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:21,430
It was impossible to properly train or
manage everyone despite having a lot of

234
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,740
issues getting adjusted to
the new policy of the plan.

235
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,770
It actually worked for a
very short window of time.

236
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,620
Crop production went up
and people were healthy.

237
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,900
Aaron's had more food
to eat than ever before.

238
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,010
Despite the setbacks.

239
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:35,120
The Chinese people were also able to Iraq,

240
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,280
a few modern buildings.

241
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,510
This progress,

242
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,330
it all came crashing down
in less than a year ago.

243
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,740
This happened in the winter of 1959
miles or dawn had suggested that farmers

244
00:11:44,741 --> 00:11:48,010
grow more grain and this
was stored in silos.

245
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,491
However,

246
00:11:48,491 --> 00:11:51,730
without grabbing other types of
food to store for the winter months,

247
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:52,030
it men,

248
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,840
the people were to survive
only on bread and the winter.

249
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,770
The weather that year,

250
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,940
it was awful as well.

251
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,860
They experienced widespread droughts,

252
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,460
followed by massive typhoons that caused
the flooding that destroyed crops,

253
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,210
tigers,

254
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:04,631
leopards,

255
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,960
and wolves were attacking farmers as
they tried to cultivate more lands.

256
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,650
Therefore,

257
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:12,370
mal created an antipasto campaign where
he encouraged people to shoot these

258
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:14,530
animals on site and eat their meat.

259
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,600
This push tigers and leopards near
extinction as people killed 75% of their

260
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,434
population.

261
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:24,730
The great leap forward with actually a
huge step backwards for China and is it

262
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:28,330
created a widespread famine
that killed millions of people.

263
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,710
People resorted to eating household
pets like dogs and cats just in order to

264
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:33,520
survive.

265
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,470
Some even resorted to cannibalism.

266
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,390
In 1959 he was so unpopular that he
had to step down as the chairman of the

267
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,450
Communist Party and he handed over his
position as state chairman to a more

268
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:45,100
moderate party representative.

269
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,420
Thee shall Qui,

270
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,100
however,

271
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,651
mows it on,

272
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:51,340
continued to work in a leading position
in the governments and tried to run his

273
00:12:51,341 --> 00:12:53,830
great leap forward from behind the scenes.

274
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,730
Instead of recognizing that his policy
was doomed to fail mouser dawn was

275
00:12:57,731 --> 00:13:02,140
convinced that this was just bad luck
and it's press the people to keep going.

276
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,040
However,

277
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,060
people just continued
to die year after year.

278
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:07,811
Finally,

279
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:09,610
in 1961 the great leap forward,

280
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:12,400
it was canceled by the time
he finally ended the policy.

281
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,560
36 million people that died.

282
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,050
Yeah.

283
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,430
You'd think that after being responsible
for the deaths of millions of people

284
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:28,130
and somehow not being killed for it,

285
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,881
the had no,

286
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:29,930
it was time to quit,

287
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,220
but in 1966 miles of dawn trying to
regain the trust of the people and become

288
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,001
state chairman,

289
00:13:35,001 --> 00:13:35,834
once again,

290
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,890
he has a place,

291
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:39,590
the blame for his mistakes somewhere else.

292
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,620
He claims that the Bosch was he the top
1% of society were ruining everything

293
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,730
and that Mao himself,

294
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,500
he was on the side of the peasants.

295
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,110
He builds up a cult of
personality and people,

296
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,020
they strongly supported
them again because well,

297
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:57,710
they remembered him as a revolutionary
hero who saved their country from the

298
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:02,450
Japanese and provided them with food
rations and free healthcare is fully was.

299
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,460
They were willing to
do whatever you asked.

300
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,270
He knew from his days as a college
student that young people were perfect for

301
00:14:08,271 --> 00:14:09,830
molding into revolutionaries.

302
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,850
He convinced a group of students called
the Red God to seek out anyone who was

303
00:14:13,851 --> 00:14:15,800
speaking out against the Communist Party.

304
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,610
He encouraged them to even murder their
professors who spoke against Mao's

305
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:22,580
policies just in order to
make an example of them.

306
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,140
According to some accounts smells,

307
00:14:24,141 --> 00:14:25,850
red guards swept so savage,

308
00:14:25,851 --> 00:14:30,851
they partook in flesh and banquets or
ritualistic cannibalism if their enemies

309
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,260
mouser dorm called the USSR and
North Korea treater revisionist.

310
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:39,410
See what bastardizing the
original work of Karl Marx.

311
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,890
His interpretation of communism was so
different from the rest of the world that

312
00:14:42,891 --> 00:14:47,270
many people call his philosophy Maoism
instead of isolating is people from the

313
00:14:47,271 --> 00:14:49,430
outside world like
other communist nations.

314
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,230
He encouraged globalization,

315
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,011
open trade,

316
00:14:52,011 --> 00:14:56,180
which is why China's economy eventually
rebounded and did need this actually set

317
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,150
the stage for the economic
strength that China has today.

318
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:04,270
In 1968 the minister of Pakistan brought
a gift of 14 mangoes to chairman.

319
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,000
Now,

320
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,400
people of China had never
eaten tropical fruit before,

321
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:09,110
so this was a delicacy to them.

322
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,660
Now could impossibly
40 mangoes on his own,

323
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,260
so he hands down with the fruit twist
political team and a couple got in the

324
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,420
hands of a group of factory workers.

325
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,100
They were so mesmerized by this magical
sweet fruit that they literally started

326
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:25,940
to wash a bit saying that it was a
symbol of the wonderful new things that

327
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,830
Chairman Mao would bring to their land.

328
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
They taste it in a glass case
and when the freeway went bad,

329
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,080
they replaced it with a wax replica.

330
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,610
One man who had never tried mango before
questioned why everyone was worshiping

331
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,480
this piece of fruit.

332
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,450
He tried to compare it to a sweet potato.

333
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:45,140
You simply couldn't believe that
mangoes could taste so great.

334
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,640
Well then it got a little bit ridiculous
because even the mere suggestion that a

335
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:54,040
mango wasn't a magical fruit was
enough to kill a man for treason.

336
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,430
This is just one of many examples of
how irrationally devoted to Mouser Dong.

337
00:15:58,431 --> 00:15:59,820
People were in the,

338
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,840
in 1970 when the country was
running low on building supplies,

339
00:16:02,841 --> 00:16:07,070
Mouser don audit his workers to tear
down the Great Wall of China in order to

340
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:11,360
use the bricks to build new houses and
the damned you also destroyed engine dot

341
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:14,990
worker or anything else
that was considered to be a
symbol of the bourgeoisie.

342
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,910
He was willing to dismantle thousands of
years of Chinese history and culture in

343
00:16:19,911 --> 00:16:22,100
order to execute is communist vision.

344
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,390
When he was getting older and Mouser
don was shameless when it came to you

345
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,760
reaping the benefits of
being a communist dictator.

346
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,050
You almost never bathed or brushed his
teeth and claims that he fenced himself

347
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,590
inside the bodies of his
mistresses and not surprisingly,

348
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:44,700
he contracted sexually transmitted
infections and spread them deep.

349
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,700
Several women who actually wore their
illness as something of a badge of honor

350
00:16:48,701 --> 00:16:51,160
since it was given to
them by Chairman Mao.

351
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,060
Yup.

352
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,930
When he was in his sixties he appointed
a 16 year old girl named Jan Yufeng to

353
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,250
be his personal secretary.

354
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,300
She spent so much time with him that
even Mao Zedong's wife had to go through

355
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:05,260
January thing first before she could
make an appointment and speak with her

356
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:06,010
husband.

357
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,930
In 1973 he was sitting in a trade meeting
with Henry Kissinger and he reportedly

358
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:14,740
offered to trade 10 million
Chinese women to the United States.

359
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,730
He said that women caused
too many problems and that
it would be better to just

360
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:19,480
get rid of them.

361
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,340
In 1974 his third wife,

362
00:17:21,341 --> 00:17:23,070
the beautiful actress Jane Chin,

363
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,100
decided that she would not sit
around waiting for husbands,

364
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,340
respect and affection.

365
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,460
She began gathering our own
collection of young male lovers.

366
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:34,270
She got so bold she wouldn't even allow
her boyfriend's do show up at the house

367
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:37,240
and now never protested against our fas.

368
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,220
When he died in 1976 people,

369
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,510
they were devastated him.

370
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:44,320
He was buried in a crystal caskets so
that people could see his body when they

371
00:17:44,321 --> 00:17:47,800
came to visit lines of people
queued up to pay their respects,

372
00:17:47,801 --> 00:17:49,240
and many of them openly,

373
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,570
when they saw the body
of their dear leader,

374
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,740
even to this day,

375
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:56,340
the memory of males are Dong is
revered by many as they remember him.

376
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,010
That's one of the great
heroes of the nation,

377
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,510
but loving more hasten China would be a
very different place today if it was not

378
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,130
for malice.

379
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:06,090
Saddam maybe without him trying to,

380
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:08,970
would have never become a
leading economic power house,

381
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,650
but maybe without seven millions of
people would not have died is the chairman

382
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:14,010
now,

383
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,700
not exactly the cheeriest of subjects,

384
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,111
but you know what,

385
00:18:16,111 --> 00:18:18,240
can take the edge off his communist ways?

386
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:18,960
Well,

387
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,770
a cocktail,

388
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,340
and that's convenient because today's
video is brought to you by Shaker and

389
00:18:23,341 --> 00:18:23,670
spirit.

390
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:23,820
Now,

391
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:23,911
no,

392
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:27,240
I'm not going to mix up some cocktails
at work because I'm not don draper.

393
00:18:27,241 --> 00:18:30,060
So let's through the magic of
television and travel home.

394
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:30,751
Hello,

395
00:18:30,751 --> 00:18:31,920
welcome to my home.

396
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,810
Let's make some cocktails.

397
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,800
Good.

398
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,450
So we have Shaker and spoon.

399
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,480
You get three cocktails that you
get to have a crack at this month.

400
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,580
They are the spice of life tea and
honey and the mighty creek cobbler.

401
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,850
Now I believe that gets them,

402
00:18:57,851 --> 00:19:00,760
so we used one of these
hydrated mandarin wheels,

403
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,140
so I'm going to make this,

404
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,410
it's mostly with Irish whiskey and a
half a bottle of Irish whiskey on hand,

405
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:06,244
so that's a good thing.

406
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,420
First step,

407
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,160
I need to crush some ice.

408
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:17,043
Okay.

409
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,530
Now with Shaker and spoon,

410
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,530
it's available in the u s
obviously I'm not there,

411
00:19:22,531 --> 00:19:26,250
so they make special accommodations
and send me this stuff internationally,

412
00:19:26,251 --> 00:19:27,450
which I really appreciate.

413
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,410
They normally ship the fruit
with them I to by my own orange,

414
00:19:31,411 --> 00:19:35,430
but don't worry everything you need
except for the booze comes in the box.

415
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,350
I also worry this orange is absolutely
massive and might not actually fit in my

416
00:19:40,351 --> 00:19:41,184
gloss.

417
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,410
Okay.

418
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,540
This is a fine looking orange.

419
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,610
Good news or my needs it
bit them in the glass.

420
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,430
I should read the recipe I suppose
before I start with these things,

421
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:56,160
but the two big,

422
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,120
even when my shaker,

423
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,310
this is a ridiculously huge orange.

424
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:04,580
I'm just going to cut them in half and
put them in like that because apparently

425
00:20:06,151 --> 00:20:08,100
my local shop sells mucins oranges,

426
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:11,130
one and a half ounces
of orange spice syrup.

427
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,000
This is it.

428
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:13,651
Go Myself.

429
00:20:13,651 --> 00:20:13,951
One of these.

430
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:17,610
I always feel like it was such a
bartender we like and it makes that,

431
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,480
that nice ringing sound,

432
00:20:19,481 --> 00:20:20,314
so put that in there.

433
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,230
Pop that in there.

434
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,560
Good.

435
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,260
A muddle of that.

436
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,240
Six seconds.

437
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,220
You know what's cool?

438
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,960
If you don't know what modeling is,

439
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,640
it tells you right here using a muddler
press fruit or herbs into the bottom of

440
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:33,300
the glass,

441
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,070
usually with added sugar or syrup.

442
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,083
When muddling.

443
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:40,140
Be careful not to destroy the fruit or
herbs you want to release their island

444
00:20:40,141 --> 00:20:40,950
flavor.

445
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,120
Not Pulverize.

446
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,590
I didn't have a muddler.

447
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,240
I'm pretty sure they sent me a muddler.

448
00:20:45,241 --> 00:20:46,470
I think I lost it.

449
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,033
I'm sorry.

450
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,830
Today we're using some Tullamore dew.

451
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:54,723
That in there.

452
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,790
Add that all in math.

453
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,283
Oh yeah.

454
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,973
Oh.

455
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,970
Dawnish we want on these bad boys.

456
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,103
Oh my God.

457
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,720
It is super good.

458
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,111
Thank you.

459
00:21:23,111 --> 00:21:24,010
Shaker and spearing.

460
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:26,500
I'm sure you can all understand why this.

461
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,170
Probably one of my favorite sponsorships.

462
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,340
You know,

463
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,510
lots of useful stuff,

464
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,250
but this is the fun stuff.

465
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:37,030
You get $20 off your first box with
Shaker and spoon at sea on a link in the

466
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:39,010
