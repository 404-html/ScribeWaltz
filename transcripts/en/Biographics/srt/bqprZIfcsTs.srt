Just before we get started
with today's video,

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,860
Hundreds of years ago,

7
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:17,170
if you told someone that one's a human
beings would fly through the air that

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,230
assume you were talking about witchcraft,

9
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:24,290
and yet in 1904 the Wright brothers
flew the first successful airplane.

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,960
One decade later in 1914
Jack Parsons was born.

11
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,260
While most boys of his generation
was still fascinated by airplanes,

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,750
Parsons was already two steps ahead.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,430
He dreamed about building the first rocket
ship that would take men to the moon.

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:39,630
Of course,

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,291
back then,

16
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:40,781
this idea,

17
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:44,520
it was considered a total fantasy and
the 1920s and thirties characters like

18
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,810
buck Rogers popularize
the idea that humans could
explore the expanses of space,

19
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,760
but it was purely science fiction.

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,620
Flying an airplane is one thing,

21
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:57,300
but no man could truly go to the
moon and less they had magic powers.

22
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,420
Scientists and engineers from
around the world said that the math,

23
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,410
it's simply didn't add up and that
mankind would never make it out of the

24
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,244
stratosphere.

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,970
For Jeremy Parsons and the opinions of
all these experts didn't stop him from

26
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,250
trying to make this dream a reality.

27
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,270
He studied the chemistry necessary to
create a liquid rocket fuel that was in

28
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:18,240
fact strong enough to defy
gravity and for good measure,

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,370
he practiced a bit of magic.

30
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,360
Yup.

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,650
Magic is work would become the basis
of NASA as modern day space program,

32
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:29,400
but his legacy was tarnished by
his involvement with the occult.

33
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,530
Instead of being in the
limelight of history,

34
00:01:31,531 --> 00:01:35,520
the memory of his accomplishments
was pushed aside for years.

35
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,640
This is the story of
the original rocket man,

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,080
Jack Parsons,

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,580
Jack Parsons parents' roof,

38
00:01:56,581 --> 00:02:00,360
Whiteside and Marvel Parsons were
originally from wealthy families and

39
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:01,200
Massachusetts.

40
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:06,120
They moved to Los Angeles together in
the early 19 hundreds in 1914 they gave

41
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,040
birth to the subject of today's video,

42
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,340
marvel Whiteside Parsons
when he was very young,

43
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:14,910
his parents got a divorce and Ruth
Whiteside called her son Jack.

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,750
Instead.

45
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,051
Roof,

46
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,050
purchased a house on Orange
Grove Avenue in Pasadena,

47
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:19,621
California,

48
00:02:19,621 --> 00:02:23,850
which has the nickname of millionaire
male because the streets are lined with

49
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,540
mansions.

50
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,140
Parsons was a bookworm and he enjoyed
reading Psyfari and instead of playing

51
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:29,550
outside and making friends,

52
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,330
he was so fascinated by stories of
magic that he wants trying to summon the

53
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,070
devil in his own bedroom.

54
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,120
Parsons wanted to grow up to build a
rocket ship so badly he was willing to do

55
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:42,540
whatever it took even
selling his soul to Satan.

56
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,800
Nothing happens,

57
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:48,270
of course in z later call this
experience a magical fiasco and he never

58
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,460
attempted to do it again in junior high.

59
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,270
He did badly in school even though he
had a bright minds growing up without a

60
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,230
father Parsons,

61
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:58,890
he was awkward around other boys and many
people considered him to be a feminist

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,280
and other boy in his class.

63
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:04,060
Edward Form in was also bullied
for reading science fiction books.

64
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,260
The two became close friends and shared
the dream of one day going into space

65
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,640
when they were in high school,

66
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,140
they experimented with fireworks and
homemade rockets in the Parsons is

67
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,990
backyards.

68
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,830
He was always trying to figure out
methods to make the rockets go higher into

69
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:18,430
the air.

70
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,480
The backyard was full of large craters
made from all of these attempts.

71
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:22,900
Indeed,

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,390
he was so hyper focused on
this goal that is grades.

73
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:27,550
They continued to plumbers Jack Parsons,

74
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,180
his mother,

75
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,660
she sent him to a boarding school called
the Brown military academy and the

76
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:33,220
hopes that this would straighten them out,

77
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,450
but it didn't work.

78
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:37,840
He was expelled for blowing up
on if the dormitory toilets,

79
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,160
Ruth wide sites father,

80
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,530
they'd been supporting
that lavish lifestyle.

81
00:03:41,531 --> 00:03:45,970
So when he passed away in 1931 the
answer move to a much smaller house.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,330
Parsons was attending college to study
physics and chemistry at the time,

83
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,290
but he had to drop out because his family,

84
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,020
he could no longer afford the tuition.

85
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,710
The chemistry classes he took in school
were enough for him to find a job as a

86
00:03:56,711 --> 00:03:58,480
chemist at the Hercules powder company,

87
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,880
which specialized in creating gunpowder.

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,680
He owns $100 a month,

89
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:07,210
which is more like $1,760 a
month after modern inflation,

90
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:10,960
and he was also learning much needed
information about explosive chemicals.

91
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,070
He married Alan Northrop in
1935 when he was 21 years old.

92
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,820
He tried to save up money for tuition
so that he could transfer his credits to

93
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:21,970
Stanford University and it
was simply too expensive.

94
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:31,771
Jack Carlson,

95
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,650
and he was still really close
with that childhood friend.

96
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:34,940
We mentioned Edward Foreman.

97
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:35,750
He ends ads,

98
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,870
attended public lectures at local
universities to learn from some of the

99
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,210
greatest minds in the
aeronautics industry.

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,510
So that's a caltech
students named Frank Molina,

101
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,880
who introduced them to his thesis advisor,

102
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,740
Theodore von Karman.

103
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:52,070
He allowed them to have access
to the Guggenheim aeronautical,

104
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,053
the Barra tree,

105
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,430
which had been abandoned
after the Great Depression.

106
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,800
Once they had access to the
state of the art equipment,

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,820
they gathered a team of other graduate
students at Caltech to help them build

108
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,950
our rocket engine.

109
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:03,421
As they,

110
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:05,000
their experiments got bigger and bigger.

111
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,410
They had to move out into the desert
to an area known as the devil's dam in

112
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:10,244
Pasadena.

113
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,450
Their official name was,

114
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,290
the Gal said,

115
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,670
rocket research projects.

116
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,080
All the rounds campus,

117
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,390
they under the nickname the suicide squad.

118
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,650
Because of that,

119
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:21,860
near death experiences
experimenting with explosives.

120
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:23,950
They succeeded in
building a rocket fueled,

121
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,060
assisted take off rockets called Jato.

122
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,721
Soon enough,

123
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:29,780
the United States staff falls took
notice in this rock attention.

124
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,770
The government hired Jack Parsons and
does friends in order to create the jet

125
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:36,200
propulsion laboratory or JPL.

126
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:36,831
Years later,

127
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:39,680
this same laboratory would
become the foundation of NASA.

128
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,100
Possums made so much money at all of
this that he was able to buy a mansion in

129
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:43,880
Pasadena,

130
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,650
which he named the parsonage.

131
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,063
Hmm.

132
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,410
By Day Jack Parsons.

133
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:58,890
It seemed to be a man of
science and logic that all did.

134
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:02,900
His friends and family know that he
was leading a double life costing magic

135
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:03,621
spells at night,

136
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,680
and the hopes that the universe
would help his dreams come true.

137
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,693
He met the magician,

138
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,750
Alistair Crowley,

139
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,910
and became deeply
involved with the occult.

140
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,520
They believed in a belief
system called [inaudible] Lima.

141
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,890
The mantra was do what thou wells,

142
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,550
which was a way of manifesting their
wants and desires into existence.

143
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,390
Unless Crowley had grown up in a strict
Quaker household where his parents

144
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:25,580
raised him to read the
Bible on a daily basis.

145
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,541
Later in life,

146
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,900
he was able to attend to
Cambridge University where
it became evidence that he

147
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,610
had a genius level Iq.

148
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,880
He wholly rejected the teachings of the
Bible and focused instead on secularism.

149
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,610
However,

150
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,390
anything against Christianity
was interpreted as being demonic.

151
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,780
Crowley fully embraced this
as part of his identity,

152
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:49,130
calling himself the beast and attempting
to summon powerful demons to come to

153
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:49,790
his aid.

154
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,510
From the time Jack Parsons
was experimenting with
rockets in his backyard as a

155
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:54,000
kid,

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,560
the idea that man could actually
go into space was still a fantasy.

157
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,070
Many people refuse to believe that it
could one day be real and while it's hard

158
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:05,210
for us to imagine now the mere suggestion
that man could reach the moon was

159
00:07:05,211 --> 00:07:07,130
considered to be rather simple.

160
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,731
While fell.

161
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,270
Oma has plenty of spooky and
paranormal elements to their religion.

162
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,810
Their core belief system was actually not
too far away from many new age beliefs

163
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:20,270
and modern day publications like the
secret which calls the concept of the law

164
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:24,740
of attraction practitioners of the
Lima did they in fact believe in magic,

165
00:07:24,741 --> 00:07:27,260
but it wasn't just card
tricks and parlor games.

166
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,330
They practiced sex magic,

167
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,640
which is exactly what it sounds like.

168
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:35,330
They believe that the intense feeling
people have while having an orgasm opens

169
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:36,500
the gate to the universe.

170
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,680
They believed that in that
small window of opportunity,

171
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,370
it is possible for a human
being to perform a magic spell.

172
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:43,581
Well,

173
00:07:43,581 --> 00:07:45,200
they really needed to do to perform.

174
00:07:45,201 --> 00:07:49,730
This spell was to focus on their intention
while having sex and then wish would

175
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:52,760
come true because it was
put out into the universe.

176
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,420
Jack Parsons became the leader of his
own group and they would have huge sex

177
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:58,670
magic orgies and his mansion in Pasadena.

178
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,780
Not surprisingly,

179
00:07:59,781 --> 00:08:00,291
Parsons,

180
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,720
his wife did not enjoy
this sort of lifestyle,

181
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,620
so she left him.

182
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,380
He began to have an affair
with his wife's sister,

183
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,820
Sarah Northrop Hollister.

184
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,250
We believed very strongly in the occult,

185
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,180
unlike her sister.

186
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,740
She actually enjoyed participating in
these orgies and Jack Parsons was just one

187
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,160
of many men in the group that she
would practice sex magic with.

188
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,780
While it may not surprise anyone,

189
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,060
Alistair Crowley was addicted to Saxons,

190
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,740
multiple orgasms in one day.

191
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,600
We're no longer enough to satisfy him.

192
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:30,890
He experimented with drugs and he
eventually became addicted to heroin,

193
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,300
which was his downfall.

194
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,160
As one of Jack Parsons meetings,

195
00:08:34,161 --> 00:08:35,690
he and Sarah Hollister mad say,

196
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:38,720
science fiction writer
named l Ron Hubbard.

197
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,190
If that name sounds familiar to you,

198
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,580
it's because Howard would go on
to found the cult of Scientology,

199
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,260
but at this time he was one of the very
few saifai writers who were writing in

200
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:51,560
such detail about the possibility
of sending humans into space.

201
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,970
As a hardcore Scifi nerd,

202
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,910
Jack Parsons was thrilled to meet l Ron
Hubbard and invited him to join in on

203
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,650
their parties as much as he wants it.

204
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,160
Parsons believed that he could
summon a goddess named Babylon.

205
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,450
She has described as being the great
mother of the earth and a symbol of

206
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:07,890
sexually liberated women.

207
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,910
He asked his followers do participate
in a project called the Babylon working.

208
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,760
He thought through all of
these sex magic rituals,

209
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:18,900
the scarlet woman would come along
to give birth to the moon child.

210
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:23,970
They believed that this child could
be raised to aspire to travel to space

211
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:27,510
instead of holding onto the comforts of
bath if they never actually gave birth

212
00:09:27,511 --> 00:09:31,320
to a real baby because they hoped that
this would be more of a symbolic gesture

213
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,570
for future generations of mankind's.

214
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,960
A scarlet woman was a symbol of free
love throughout the world so people could

215
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,600
have sex outside of marriage more openly.

216
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,111
In a way,

217
00:09:40,111 --> 00:09:43,410
you could actually say that this spell
actually worked just a few years later.

218
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,980
The United States entered the space race
in the entire world's turned on their

219
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:51,660
televisions to watch the first steps onto
the moon in the 1960s the hippies then

220
00:09:51,661 --> 00:09:54,510
spread the free love movement
that Parsons had hoped for.

221
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,930
Maybe just maybe all of that sex
magic actually ended up working

222
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,610
after discovering his ties to the occult
in the late Forties Jack Parsons was

223
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,890
fired from his job at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

224
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,450
Since he was down on his luck.

225
00:10:14,451 --> 00:10:18,350
L Ron Hubbard asked Jack Parsons if he
would be interested in partnering in a

226
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,700
Boot Business in Florida.

227
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,680
Parsons gave hobbits $20,000 to start the
business and Sarah Lester asked if she

228
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:27,740
could go to after stealing his
girlfriends and robbing him,

229
00:10:27,741 --> 00:10:31,550
blind Parsons realized that he'd made
a terrible mistake by trusting him.

230
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,301
At this point,

231
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:35,180
l Ron Hubbard did create a
successful boating business,

232
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,890
but he never paid the money back.

233
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,740
Jack Parsons out to go to
court to get his $20,000.

234
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:40,581
Years later,

235
00:10:40,581 --> 00:10:40,731
I'll,

236
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:44,870
Ron Hubbard would become the founder of
his own religion called Scientology and

237
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:47,540
he used this boat business
to create a sea org.

238
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,830
He borrowed much of the same principles
taught by Alistair Crowley and Jack

239
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,340
Parsons about setting intentions and
being the best person you can be.

240
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:59,540
He also mixed in his own fictional ideas
made up in his science fiction novels,

241
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,530
even though Sarah Hollister left
Jack Parsons to Mary l Ron Hubbard,

242
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,550
there were plenty of other women in the
group who practically worshiped him.

243
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,640
He mass an actress and artists
named Marjorie Cameron.

244
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,620
Just like all of his other intentions.

245
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:16,340
He had put his ideas about an elements
or woman out into the universe,

246
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,040
so when he met her he believed
that they were soulmates.

247
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,550
They were so intensely attracted to one
another when they first met that they

248
00:11:22,551 --> 00:11:25,280
spent two weeks straight
making love in his bedroom.

249
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:30,400
He married Cameron in 1946 Marjorie
Cameron was more than a tad bit eccentric.

250
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,360
She claims that she had visions of the
coming apocalypse and she created artwork

251
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,990
about how a cults beliefs that would
later become popular during the beat

252
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:39,824
generation.

253
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,180
The 1950s was the beginning
of the McCarthy era where
the FBI was investigating

254
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:47,960
anyone under suspicion of having
ties to the communist party.

255
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,860
They began to investigate Jack Parsons
due to the fact that he took documents

256
00:11:51,861 --> 00:11:54,610
saying from his new
employer aircraft company,

257
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,540
they suspected that he may be supplying
the USS all with these documents about

258
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,440
rocket engines.

259
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,161
After learning,

260
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,480
he was under investigation.

261
00:12:01,481 --> 00:12:06,310
Jack Parsons voluntarily showed up at
the FBI offices in Los Angeles to explain

262
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:09,700
that he took the documents home because
he wanted to give examples of his past

263
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,980
work to apply to a job in Israel.

264
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,130
The FBI at this point thought that he
could actually be a spy for the Israeli

265
00:12:15,131 --> 00:12:15,730
government.

266
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,530
He was fired from the Hughes Aircraft
Company and this was enough to blacklist

267
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,940
him from ever guessing another
aeronautical drop again.

268
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,750
Declassified documents reveal that the
FBI had been following Jack Parsons

269
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:30,070
movements since 1948 because it
is a cult ties to us to Crowley.

270
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,340
They believe that this was a subversive
group and it's considered to be

271
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,210
dangerous.

272
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:38,800
They were simply waiting for a moment
where he might've slept up in 1951 in

273
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,550
Parsons career was over and his marriage
to Marjorie Cameron was falling apart,

274
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,870
so they separated.

275
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,110
Jack Parsons was no longer
ranking in huge paychecks.

276
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:50,560
He occasionally works as an explosives
consultants on the sets of Hollywood

277
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,394
action films,

278
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,300
but these gigs were few and far between
he and to work the night shift at a gas

279
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:58,810
station and he rented out the spare
rooms in his house for extra income.

280
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,970
In June of 1952 Parsons received an
order from a film set to create several

281
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:05,200
explosives for a movie.

282
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,350
They asked him to hurry because they
were running on a tight schedule.

283
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,580
One of his tenants jokes,

284
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,560
be careful or your blow us all up.

285
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,860
Parsons responded with a chocolate and
said that everything would be fine.

286
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,053
An hour later,

287
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,230
the lab exploded.

288
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,310
He was still alive,

289
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,130
but half of his face had been
blown off from an explosion.

290
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,420
It was rushed to the hospital,

291
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,070
but he died from his injuries.

292
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,600
Just 37 years old.

293
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,730
His official cause of death
had been ruled as an accidents,

294
00:13:28,731 --> 00:13:31,350
but many elements of the
explosion ops around it,

295
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:32,170
a mystery.

296
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:35,440
He had so many years of mixing
chemicals and creating bombs.

297
00:13:35,441 --> 00:13:39,340
People find it hard to believe that Jack
Parsons could have made such a careless

298
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,110
mistake,

299
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:43,960
something that maybe it was feeling
so low that he wanted to kill himself,

300
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,990
but if Parsons intention
truly wants to commit suicide,

301
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,650
he would have known how to build a bomb
that would have killed himself instantly

302
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,630
instead of suffering in the hospital.

303
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,110
Some people speculate that
someone wanted him dead ends.

304
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,810
They snuck into his lab to
tamper with this chemicals.

305
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,140
The idea that he was assassinated
by the government is a conspiracy,

306
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,390
but it certainly does make a lot of sense.

307
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,440
It seems almost too convenient that Jack
Parsons blew himself up at the start of

308
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:09,274
the Cold War.

309
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,750
He knew plenty of government secrets
about that fledgling space program and he

310
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,720
was already showing signs of
wanting to flee the country.

311
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,850
Parsons truly was a genius capable of
building a bigger and better Rawkus than

312
00:14:21,851 --> 00:14:23,740
the ones created by the u s government,

313
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:28,180
and they may have feared that he
would sell his services to the USSR.

314
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,780
The fact that Jack Parsons credited his
work with the occult for a success in

315
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:35,470
rocket science was an embarrassment
the rest of the aeronautical community.

316
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,190
If the public knew about this,

317
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,140
it would completely ruin the credibility
of the government's attempts to build a

318
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:41,974
space program,

319
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:45,220
but they were already having a hard time
raising taxpayer dollars without some

320
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:47,530
guy chatting about sex magic.

321
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,191
Sadly,

322
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:51,470
the program and is a lot more credibility
you want to see was out of the picture

323
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,461
after his death.

324
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,880
NASA would name one if the craters
on the moon after Jack Parsons only.

325
00:14:55,881 --> 00:14:56,870
It was on the dark side.

326
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,800
This is very much how they felt about
his contribution to rocket science,

327
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,050
but they wanted to give
credit where credit is due,

328
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:07,190
but many wanted to keep his memory out
of the limelight while he was alive.

329
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:07,820
Jack Parsons,

330
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,450
his ultimate goal was to have his
rocket experiments succeed not just for

331
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:12,230
himself,

332
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,850
but for future generations.

333
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:16,430
He wanted the whole world to look to
the stars and know that it could be a

334
00:15:16,431 --> 00:15:20,420
reality and not just some fantasy
written about in a Scifi novel,

335
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,530
whether you believe in the supernatural
Nazi in a way past and sex magic spell

336
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:28,010
is actually worked because all of his
intentions that he sat out into the

337
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,990
universe eventually came true.

338
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:30,741
Tragically,

339
00:15:30,741 --> 00:15:33,800
he did not live long enough to
see NASA send demand to the moon,

340
00:15:33,801 --> 00:15:36,620
but if he was watching
from across the universe,

341
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,850
it would surely be proud and if you
want to learn a bit about the real stuff

342
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:42,350
that Parsons was interested in,

343
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,720
a great way to do that
is through brilliance.

344
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,620
We talked a lot about rocket science
in today's video and while this is

345
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:50,360
certainly a complex subject,

346
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:53,660
it is one that brilliant make
really easy to get to grips with.

347
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,470
The way brilliant works is through
something called active learning and it's

348
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:58,760
really super effective.

349
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,270
Basically what this means is that you're
not spending time reading about how

350
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,260
something works,

351
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:04,670
looking at complex equations,

352
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,300
etc. Basically going over it again and
again and again until it gets in your

353
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:08,960
head.

354
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,370
For me often.

355
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,350
That's something that gets
just really frustrating.

356
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:14,090
I know a lot of people feel the same way.

357
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,070
Taking rocket physics as an example,

358
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,430
rather than showing you something
really complex and explaining it,

359
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,410
it all starts with something super simple.

360
00:16:21,411 --> 00:16:24,260
You just have to solve a
puzzle related to the topic.

361
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:27,590
It's great to see how you do a few of
these puzzles and just a few minutes later

362
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,760
you find yourself saying,

363
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,181
oh,

364
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:31,100
so that's what the side
of the equation works.

365
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,800
It's very cool and as someone
without a background in science,

366
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:35,180
I pretty much started off thinking,

367
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:35,421
yeah,

368
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:37,670
guys in not getting to be able
to explain that equation to me,

369
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,710
but just a few interactive puzzles,

370
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:39,970
lace.

371
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,310
I'm like,

372
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,610
Oh,

373
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,421
well now I get it.

374
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,254
That's pretty cool.

375
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,060
It really is just like that.

376
00:16:44,061 --> 00:16:46,250
It's kind of a weird way
to describe the process.

377
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:46,581
I know,

378
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:47,720
but that's how it works.

379
00:16:47,721 --> 00:16:51,170
It's really interesting
how the information and has
your head through this way

380
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:52,070
of active learning.

381
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:55,970
It's a great way to learn and to
support biographics and learn more about
