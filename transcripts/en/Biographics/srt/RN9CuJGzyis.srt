1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,320
He was the richest man in America.

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,090
The world at his fingertips bans,

3
00:00:05,091 --> 00:00:05,451
yes,

4
00:00:05,451 --> 00:00:08,510
he was a prisoner to his own dark fears.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,640
His achievements were astounding.

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:12,710
He created the fastest
plane on the planet,

7
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:17,300
was the driving force behind the largest
aircraft ever built and was a pioneer

8
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:18,170
in film making,

9
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:23,060
and yet he is remembered for the
eccentricities that drove him from hero to

10
00:00:23,061 --> 00:00:24,500
harness in his heyday.

11
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,050
He was a romantic figure with movie style.

12
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:28,820
It's blocking to be seen on his own,

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,810
and yet he spent the last 26
years of his life as a recluse,

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,040
obsessed with cleanliness and controlling
every aspect of his environment.

15
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,480
Even as he sunk deeper and deeper into
madness and this biographics episode,

16
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:46,481
we entered these strange worlds of the
original eccentric billionaire Howard

17
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:47,983
Hughes.

18
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,800
When it comes to the
life of Howard Hughes,

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,520
it can be a challenge to
separate fact from fiction.

20
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,850
Even the details of his
birth were falsified.

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,880
Official records give that
date as December the 24th,

22
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:14,451
19,

23
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:15,620
85 in Houston,

24
00:01:15,621 --> 00:01:16,280
Texas.

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,820
The reality is that it had been born
two months earlier in the oil town of

26
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:20,500
humble,

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,070
100 miles from Texas,

28
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,990
from there for you as well.

29
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,080
They just built upon each other
and he was not one of triplets,

30
00:01:27,081 --> 00:01:28,730
nor was his mother's sisters,

31
00:01:28,731 --> 00:01:32,570
illegitimate son or a substance user baby
brought in to replace the one who had

32
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,350
died.

33
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,580
All these fanciful stories were later
told by the man himself in order to build

34
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:40,190
upon the aura that surrounded his name,

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,610
you senior known as both a
shortened form of his middle name.

36
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:47,810
Roberts had been a penniless scoundrel
bombing his way around Joplin,

37
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:50,930
Missouri at the turn of
the 19th century in 18,

38
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:51,560
99.

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,520
He was running out of the town by the
furious father of a girl who he tried to

40
00:01:55,521 --> 00:02:00,010
seduce with no other options that dreamy
eyed laracon decided to try his hand at

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,070
the oil business,

42
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,300
making his way to Texas,

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:06,920
but just happened to be on hands when he
thousand foot spume of black oil itself

44
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:10,250
from the grounds at spindletop
on January the 10th of 19.

45
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:10,910
Oh one.

46
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,210
He was among the first to grab claims,

47
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,630
buying our plans for a few dollars and
Acre and selling it only days later,

48
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,180
hundreds of dollars within a few months,

49
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,930
having amassed a small fortune boom.

50
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,690
Moved to Houston where he found it.

51
00:02:23,691 --> 00:02:25,610
The Texas oil fuel company,

52
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,460
vf four runner to tax
code within six months.

53
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:33,461
He had also married the darkly prettier
but seriously hypochondriacal Ilene

54
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:33,770
Garner,

55
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,220
Eileen.

56
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,150
She was terrified of small animals
and had an insect phobio fueled by an

57
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:40,730
obsession with cleanliness via straights.

58
00:02:40,731 --> 00:02:41,151
Well,

59
00:02:41,151 --> 00:02:45,710
they were defined full expression in
her son by the time that Howard junior

60
00:02:45,711 --> 00:02:46,401
known as sunny,

61
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:47,510
entered the world in 19 Oh,

62
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:47,810
five.

63
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:50,450
His father was still chasing oil still.

64
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,320
He was frustrated not so much
as finding the oil locations,

65
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:58,070
but at the inferior quality of the
drilling tools that were available.

66
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,810
Finally,

67
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,070
out the exasperations,

68
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,120
he set his sights on
designing a better drill bit.

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,240
On November the 20th,

70
00:03:04,241 --> 00:03:09,241
1,980 emerged from his study with designs
for a bis the contained to 168 cutting

71
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:11,230
edges.

72
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,570
He had just invented the Hughes tool,

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,780
this from which would flow
the millions of dollars,

74
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,870
which would both enrich and ultimately
destroy his son App by the age of four.

75
00:03:22,581 --> 00:03:26,560
It was obvious that sunny hughes had
inherited the partial deafness that run in

76
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,190
the family,

77
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:30,550
the condition it will become progressively
worse over Howard's lifetime.

78
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,331
As a youngster,

79
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:34,180
he had caused him to become
isolated and introspective.

80
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,760
Now that money was no object,

81
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:38,620
so the eight year olds cues was
sent to an exclusive private school.

82
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:42,460
He didn't make a very good impression
though with a head teacher remembering him

83
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,220
as an upper to snobbish and bore who
refuse to join in with the other boys

84
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,330
preferring to sit with the girls.

85
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,470
Not surprisingly,

86
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:53,680
he seemed gains a reputation as a sissy,

87
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,550
but the young Hughes,

88
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,120
he also gained a reputation
as a technical whiz kids.

89
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,350
He put together his first wireless radio
transmitter when he was only 11 years

90
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:02,830
old.

91
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,431
A year later,

92
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:05,020
his picture appeared
in the local newspaper,

93
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:08,680
proudly standing next to the first
and motorized bicycle and Houston,

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,910
which he had put together from a steam
engine and an effort to get his nervous

95
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,800
and timid boy to man up.

96
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,140
Boy decided to pack him
off to camp over the day,

97
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,660
which was the boy scouts.

98
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,550
So during the 1916 summer recess suddenly
found himself in the middle of the

99
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,890
[inaudible] mountains in Pike County,

100
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,880
Pennsylvania.

101
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,350
He was under the tutelage of a grizzled
old timer by the name of General Dan

102
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,470
Beard.

103
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,161
Surprisingly,

104
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,150
the young Hughes he took
to the woodsmen life,

105
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,240
lengthy proverbial duck to water.

106
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,860
It was already quite quickly,

107
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:42,760
learn to whistle effects Indian
signs and simulate bird calls.

108
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,620
He seemed to excel under the military
discipline of the camp to away from the

109
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,970
over protective of his mother.

110
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:53,971
It seemed he was able to shake off his
feminine nature and show his true colors.

111
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,750
In the fall of 1920,

112
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:57,020
a 14 year old son,

113
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:59,380
he went with his father to v Harvard,

114
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,090
Yale and rowing crew races in Connecticut.

115
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,030
He's seen me,

116
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:03,310
I promise to buy his son.

117
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,330
Whatever he wanted,

118
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,320
if it's favorite,

119
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,850
Harvard won that race,

120
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:07,750
went Harvard,

121
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,620
smashed Yale.

122
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,210
By 14 seconds.

123
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,470
The boy held out his hand and
expectation and asked for $5.

124
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,930
He then pointed to a selling
further up the rhythm.

125
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,890
Advertising rides on a flying boat for $5.

126
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,340
Do Senior reluctantly joined his
son for the 10 minute flight.

127
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,690
It made the for the sick,

128
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,070
but the sun had just discovered
the one true love of his life.

129
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,450
You found the experience of flying both
exhilarating and liberating from that

130
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,020
moment on,

131
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,910
he would be asking is most peaceful when
he was alone in an airplane flying high

132
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:40,810
above a wells.

133
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:42,910
The tea so often tried to escape

134
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,270
by the age of 19.

135
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,300
Both of his parents were dead.

136
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,700
His mother had died suddenly when he was
16 off suffering complications from an

137
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:01,370
ectopic pregnancy died
less than two years later,

138
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,290
have a heart attack leaving Hughes Jr.

139
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,330
The ad of the hughes tool company.

140
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:08,150
He dropped ouT of college to take
control of the company quickly.

141
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:11,150
discovering that he knew
nothing about the oil business.

142
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,150
He seemed hired a self taught
accountants buying the name of tHem.

143
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:18,650
Though a direct to take feed controls
at the same time he was legally declared

144
00:06:18,651 --> 00:06:22,040
himself an adult and seized full
control of the entire family.

145
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:22,820
Fortunately,

146
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,900
here's now had the money that he
needed to pursue his greatest passions.

147
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,340
Those passions well,

148
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,840
they had nothing to do with oil.

149
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,800
Instead they revolved around building
and flying airplanes and also making

150
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,950
movies in hollywood and other of
his passions was actually gulf.

151
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,221
Well,

152
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:39,560
one's a while playing at the
beverly hills country club.

153
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,010
He wants.

154
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:40,880
She's a biplane,

155
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:42,930
flew overhead and tipped his wing.

156
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,160
Tanner howard was able to track down
to fly and offered to pay him the

157
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:51,050
outrageous sum of $800 per day if he
would teach them to find the probably well

158
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:54,890
the readily agreed in two years later
he was was issued his private pilot's

159
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:55,724
license.

160
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,070
It's like just cHronic shyness.

161
00:07:02,071 --> 00:07:05,490
Howard was fascinated with the glitz and
glamor of hollywood in order to break

162
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:06,300
into the business.

163
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,070
He's signed a talented director,

164
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:10,830
lewis milestone to a three year contract.

165
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,630
The pairing thing immediately struck
gold with their debut picture to arabian

166
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:18,540
nights claiming and academy award in 1927.

167
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,020
This gave us the confidence
to take on his next challenge,

168
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,220
a fusion of his two great
loves flying and movies,

169
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:26,771
failing,

170
00:07:26,771 --> 00:07:29,580
defining the director who shared
his passion for the skies.

171
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,190
Howard decided to go to loan writing,

172
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,420
producing and directing the world's
first true aviation picture.

173
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,550
It was called hell's angels.

174
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,920
this was going to be his magnum opus,

175
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,860
and he was prepared to
pour in as much money,

176
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,670
time and effort as was needed
to create this masterpiece.

177
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:51,960
An athlete who was contracted that was
bigger than that of some countries during

178
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:53,370
aerial filming sequences.

179
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,810
Howard's obsessive compulsion led
him to fixate on such things as cloud

180
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,644
formations.

181
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,760
He would scrap a valuable minutes of
perfectly good footage forcing his pilots

182
00:08:02,761 --> 00:08:05,490
to reshoot until the
clouds would just for ryan

183
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:15,230
one day cubes in an effort to control
every aspect of an aerial shoots.

184
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,220
He went and taught in a small plane,

185
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,870
but no sooner had he centered than the
plane went into a tailspin and crashed

186
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:22,704
into the ground.

187
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:24,510
Howard's managed to walk away uninjured.

188
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,100
The first of a number of miraculous
plane crash escapes start that actually

189
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:29,581
commented,

190
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:32,490
that hasn't injured his check writing.

191
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,090
Um,

192
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,080
so how is obsession with
perfection that men's,

193
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,850
the shooting schedule for hell's
angels got totally out of control.

194
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:39,511
In the meantime,

195
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:44,490
the public had become infatuated with
the latest hollywood innovation talkies

196
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,500
against everyone's advice.

197
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,370
Here's decided to do rescripts in the
movie and reshoot all of the dialogue

198
00:08:50,371 --> 00:08:51,060
scenes.

199
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,800
This time adding sound.

200
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,650
The reshoots proved to be the break of
a for reform and pits plan named holly

201
00:08:57,651 --> 00:08:58,484
and compensate.

202
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:02,040
The leading lady of the movie reads a
nissen wiscosh because of the strong

203
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:05,130
norwegian accent and carpenters
stepped into the role,

204
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,840
he was transformed her into jean harlow,

205
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:08,640
the platinum blonde bombshell.

206
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,180
He became a sensation during
the 19 thirties hell's angels.

207
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,770
It was a box office mash,

208
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,570
returning double its production cost.

209
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:16,860
$4,000,000,

210
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,070
which was an exorbitant
announced at that time.

211
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,960
Unfortunately for us,

212
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,711
three movies,

213
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:22,544
flops followed.

214
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,640
They've managed to cash in on the public's
obsession with al capone by producing

215
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,020
the movie scarface.

216
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,080
We've actually got a biographics
video on him as well.

217
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,360
You can find it in a link
in the description below.

218
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:33,691
All right,

219
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:34,171
so here's,

220
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:34,951
where's one of these guys?

221
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:38,850
He always wanted to push the boundaries
and films this movie with all of the

222
00:09:38,851 --> 00:09:42,210
violence and all of the absurdities that
you'd imagined would be associated with

223
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:43,044
al capone.

224
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,720
Not surprisingly,

225
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:52,980
the sensors knocks it back,

226
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,380
the moms in major edits to the movie,

227
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:59,460
and so that surprise
hughes sued them and won.

228
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,060
The theme would be released
just as as it intended for.

229
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,820
This is the story of scarface.

230
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,111
Tony,

231
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:05,944
come on.

232
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,220
His lust for power.

233
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,113
Fancy women.

234
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,360
No work too hard.

235
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,020
I just finish up tonight,

236
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,860
so after the release of scarface,

237
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:21,700
hughes decided to step back from
hollywood's too indulgent is other great

238
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:24,130
passion and that of course was flying

239
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,840
in 1934.

240
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,150
He easily won a flying race in miami.

241
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:37,280
This success fueled his ambitions,

242
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:40,250
inspiring him to set
up the hughes aircraft.

243
00:10:40,251 --> 00:10:45,200
Company emails set helped to design and
build for wells false desk racing plane.

244
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:49,820
The results of all of his efforts was
the h one which used to a new world speed

245
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:50,290
record.

246
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:55,290
Three hundred 52 miles per hour on
august the 18th of 1935 by 1938.

247
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:59,180
Hughes was intends on
achieving another wells fest.

248
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,530
The fastest flight around the welds and
the modified lockied 14 and he took to

249
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:08,531
the skies with a handpicked crew and
set off from New York 16 hours and 38

250
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:14,111
minutes later they landed in paris
to moscow and then area three days,

251
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,880
19 hours and 14 minutes after setting out.

252
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,710
They were back in New York.

253
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,240
He was hailed as a conquering hero in
for three days the pink for these shiny

254
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:24,500
adventurer in dod,

255
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,050
ticker tape parades and
receptions in New York,

256
00:11:27,051 --> 00:11:27,800
chicago,

257
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,480
Washington,

258
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,360
and houston.

259
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,201
In 1940,

260
00:11:30,201 --> 00:11:34,190
he was moved into commercial aviation
blind grabbing a controlling share of

261
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:37,130
trans world airlines or two,

262
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,750
a short time later,

263
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,340
the us government cooling.

264
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,130
They wanted hughes aircraft
do supply plain bod salt,

265
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,000
hillary shells and cannon barrels to
help support the war effort in europe.

266
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,930
Ten years later with America well
anD truly immersed in the conflicts.

267
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,150
Hughes was contracted to design,

268
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:58,380
build a massive flying boats in order to
overcome the german u boat menace that

269
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:02,200
was causing serious problems
for us transport vessels.

270
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,140
So while doing the testing
and design for these projects,

271
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,780
hughes was involved in
his fourth plane crash.

272
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,340
He was testing a sikorsky as 43
amphibian aircraft on the lake mead,

273
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,120
Nevada.

274
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,420
The plane went down into the frigid waters
and it actually killed a ca inspector

275
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,720
and an engineer who will also
on board the vessel hughes.

276
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,401
He wants again,

277
00:12:21,401 --> 00:12:24,790
managed to walk away or that you
did receive a large gash to the top.

278
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,430
it was around this time that hughes began
to exhibit patterns of behavior that

279
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:39,240
seems odd to you only look,

280
00:12:39,241 --> 00:12:42,170
it's compulsive
handwashing to avoid germs,

281
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,440
checking and rechecking his work
and always thinking cemetery,

282
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,450
constantly trying to make things perfect.

283
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,370
All classic signs of ocd.

284
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,640
We're seeing symptoms
of a deteriorating mind.

285
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:57,100
This was hardly a good time for whispers
of insanity with his business empire,

286
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:01,220
rapidly expanding it as business
contracts imposing wheezy demands.

287
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,330
Hughes was facing stresses and pressures
from all directions to huge contracts

288
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:07,830
for the xf.

289
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,780
Eleven reconnaissance,

290
00:13:08,781 --> 00:13:13,610
blaine and the h k one spruce goose were
both over budget and they were overdue.

291
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,840
Most of the deletes that
would do to hughes hughes's
incessant tinkering and his

292
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:22,160
insistence on being the test
pilot for both planes and well.

293
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:25,930
There was this insistence which
brought about his closest color,

294
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,550
yet on july the seventh,

295
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:27,921
19,

296
00:13:27,921 --> 00:13:28,850
46 years,

297
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:33,851
took the xf 11 for its first ever test
flights over the los angeles basin.

298
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,960
Now for the first 45 minutes,

299
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,910
this plane functioned perfectly.

300
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,620
Then suddenly a propeller malfunction
caused the plane to plummet to the ground,

301
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,130
desperately wrestling with the controls
hughes hope to land on a fairway at the

302
00:13:46,131 --> 00:13:48,510
los angeles country club in stats,

303
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:51,230
the plunge through the
roof of a nearby house.

304
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,980
this it was one crash that hughes
he wasn't able to walk away from.

305
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,820
It was extracted from the record as
it went up in flames and rushed to the

306
00:13:58,821 --> 00:13:59,450
hospital

307
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:02,000
after ripping the corner from
two homes in beverly hills,

308
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:02,834
California.

309
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:05,210
The plane finally plunged into this house.

310
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:09,530
The force of the impact virtually wrecked
the building and caused the plane to

311
00:14:09,531 --> 00:14:10,364
catch fire.

312
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,840
He suffered severe head trauma and ben's
multiple buttons along with fractures

313
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:14,620
to his neck.

314
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,040
These injuries that were going to cause
him to suffering for the rest of his

315
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,700
life to control his pain.

316
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:24,460
Hughes sTarted taking a lot of drugs and
you relied on a three part cocktail of

317
00:14:24,461 --> 00:14:24,850
them,

318
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,480
coding,

319
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,860
valium and emperor emirates.

320
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:30,520
These are drugs that he took
daily for the next 30 years.

321
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,680
Still the pain and head injuries.

322
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,880
They affected his behavior,

323
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:36,760
causing his ocd to spin out of control

324
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,440
long before his addiction to painkillers.

325
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,191
How would he use?

326
00:14:56,191 --> 00:14:56,580
Well,

327
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,110
he has another addiction.

328
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,480
I am.

329
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,700
That was to winning.

330
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,160
When he came to hollywood in 1925,

331
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,370
he had a wife and an
enormous sexual appetite.

332
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,580
The wife balance.

333
00:15:06,581 --> 00:15:10,200
You'd tine of his infidelities
filing for divorce in 1929.

334
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,520
The sexual appetite very well.

335
00:15:11,521 --> 00:15:12,420
It remains end.

336
00:15:12,421 --> 00:15:16,560
Was satisfied with a list of hollywood
conquests that would include such stars

337
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,330
as peter's rita hayworth,

338
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,140
ava gardner,

339
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,010
lana turner,

340
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,570
and katharine hepburn.

341
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,260
He is well.

342
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,950
He was obsessed with the female form and
this was actually the inspiration for

343
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,570
his most controversial film.

344
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,520
The outlaw said during the old west,

345
00:15:29,521 --> 00:15:33,900
the movie was a showcase for
the voluptuous Jane Russell
with he used personally

346
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:38,310
ensuring that addresses where were
low enough to accentuate her size.

347
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:39,540
30 eight bus.

348
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,201
Once again,

349
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:43,020
these centers were
outraged but hughes realm,

350
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,140
he was laughing all the way to
the bank by the mid 19 forties.

351
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:50,310
Here's his health issues were impacting
upon his increasingly complicated

352
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,360
business empire.

353
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,400
In addition to his ownership of two,

354
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,690
the hughes tool company.

355
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,840
He now also owns the rko movie studio.

356
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:58,561
At the same time,

357
00:15:58,561 --> 00:16:03,420
he was building a huge aerospace company
to develop technology for the military

358
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,440
in 1947.

359
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:07,530
The pressure on here's what is ramped up
several notches when he was subpoenaed

360
00:16:07,531 --> 00:16:11,820
to appear before congress regarding
alleged improprieties in his government

361
00:16:11,821 --> 00:16:15,270
contracts in a commanding performance
with the dv cameras rolling.

362
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:18,390
He strongly denied profiteering
from the war effort.

363
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,733
What

364
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,953
the

365
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,833
that

366
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,400
it is sort of like running
for this congressional
appearance is most confident,

367
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,630
strong and dominant.

368
00:16:33,631 --> 00:16:38,190
Public outing was also the last time
that the public would see howard hughes.

369
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,480
The brilliance fearless,

370
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:40,560
visible millionaire.

371
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:40,890
Well,

372
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:43,650
he was transforming into
a mysterious invisible.

373
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,940
A 53 year old use was now completely
intense on retreating from society for

374
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:57,451
symptoms.

375
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,270
If it's undiagnosed obsessive
compulsive disorder,

376
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,190
where buying now or to a parent,

377
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:04,860
it refused to shake hands
or touch door handles.

378
00:17:04,861 --> 00:17:09,150
Instructions to his aides were repeated
in meticulous detail and he flew into

379
00:17:09,151 --> 00:17:13,170
violent regions when things were
not exactly as he had commanded,

380
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,860
those who worked for hughes began
calling him the old man and they became

381
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:21,360
seriously concerns that he was going and
seeing the fbi who are actually keeping

382
00:17:21,361 --> 00:17:26,361
tabs on him noted in 1950 7:15 was the
acting like inscrutable paranoiac they

383
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:26,971
added,

384
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:30,930
but it could even be capable of murder
then seemingly totally out of the blue.

385
00:17:30,931 --> 00:17:34,380
He was declared to that he was going to
marry one of the many stylists that he

386
00:17:34,381 --> 00:17:35,214
had been seeing.

387
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,330
Jean pinches.

388
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,470
Many people believe that hughes decided
to get hitched so that his aides would

389
00:17:40,471 --> 00:17:44,640
no longer be able to have him committed
to an asylum less than a year after

390
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:49,050
marrying peter's in Nevada motel room
hughes descended into one of the most

391
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,150
episodes of his life.

392
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,730
He told his aides that he
wanted to view some movie.

393
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,950
Is it a studio on sunset boulevard?

394
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,390
He didn't leave that dark and screening
room for more than four months.

395
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,640
You used to open the bag with his right
hand and hold the bag out to me at a 45

396
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,041
degree angle,

397
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:09,650
so I reached into the bag without,

398
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,670
without touching the paper.

399
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,200
During this time,

400
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,550
his diet consisted of
chocolate bars and milk,

401
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:27,290
and he spent his days and nights sitting
naked in a chair staring at the screen.

402
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,191
During this time,

403
00:18:28,191 --> 00:18:29,540
he was communicated with his aide,

404
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,340
spike scribbling on a yellow legal pad.

405
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,350
Instructions until you did not looking
at him speaking to him unless spoken to

406
00:18:36,351 --> 00:18:37,040
you first.

407
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,600
Over those four months of the studio,

408
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:43,490
his personal hygiene net rapidly
deteriorated even as his german obsession

409
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:44,330
intensifies.

410
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:48,440
When he finally emerged from the
screening room in the spring of 1958,

411
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,910
he was was an unkempt,

412
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,810
ragged sentence,

413
00:18:50,811 --> 00:18:51,890
pathetic mess.

414
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:52,551
Following this,

415
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,790
he pretty much immediately
checked into the beverly hills.

416
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:55,700
I tell them another place,

417
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:58,160
you'll only space to stay
on a temporary basis,

418
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,190
but he was ended up
staying in that for years.

419
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:01,680
Yeah.

420
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,080
He reverted to his screening room habits
sitting naked in the dark hour after

421
00:19:06,081 --> 00:19:09,590
our business dealings were conducted by
telephone and through his handwritten

422
00:19:09,591 --> 00:19:11,120
instructions during this time,

423
00:19:11,121 --> 00:19:14,480
his drug use also escalated
as he fought continuous pain.

424
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,310
Now injecting himself with morphine to
supplement his megadoses of coding and

425
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:19,820
valium.

426
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,020
In 1966,

427
00:19:21,021 --> 00:19:23,450
conducting negotiations
completely by telephone.

428
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,630
Hughes sold his controlling
sham in two eight.

429
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:28,430
This made him a billionaire,

430
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,620
the richest man in America,

431
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,110
but rather than simply syphilis.

432
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,190
Fortune hughes disliked is pathetic.

433
00:19:34,191 --> 00:19:39,191
Physical condition set his sights on
conquering a brand new frontier and that

434
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:40,130
front here,

435
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:40,671
what would it be?

436
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:41,550
Las vegas.

437
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,340
Yeah.

438
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,540
His first move was to relocate to the
penthouse suite of the deserts in where he

439
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:53,840
could continue his bizarre
lifestyle without interruption.

440
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,390
He then began buying up the city,

441
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,190
starting with the hotel
that he was living in.

442
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:02,090
His investments included the local tv
station which he bought so that he could

443
00:20:02,091 --> 00:20:04,910
demand they play the movies
that he wanted to watch.

444
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,600
Now by 1970,

445
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,300
he's.

446
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,290
He was a prisoner of his own design and
then as if things weren't crazy enough

447
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:18,860
already,

448
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,440
he suddenly left the
desert in without warning.

449
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,670
Many in his entourage,

450
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:24,030
they thought that it had been adopted.

451
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,250
Three weeks later,

452
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:27,110
he turns up in The Bahamas.

453
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,200
From that he announced that he was
turning the day to day operations of his

454
00:20:30,201 --> 00:20:33,080
empire over to a group of mormon aids.

455
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,250
In 1972,

456
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,950
he was relocated to a
hotel room in london.

457
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:39,710
He left the room only once to go flying.

458
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,370
that's this was like no flight
here had ever taken before.

459
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:47,290
Planning into the cockpit seat took off
all of his claim in the sand to around

460
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:47,920
in london,

461
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,970
in the nude.

462
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,460
Following what would be his
final flight at the helm,

463
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,400
hughes's condition.

464
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,750
Well,

465
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,310
it rapidly deteriorated.

466
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,410
He took a Fall in as london hotel room,

467
00:20:56,411 --> 00:21:00,490
which increased his
reliance on painkillers and
unfortunately took away his

468
00:21:00,491 --> 00:21:01,370
ability to work.

469
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,553
Things swelled.

470
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,120
They only went downhill from here is if
by design uses last hours were spent in

471
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:15,630
the app.

472
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:18,960
It was traveling to houston to receive
medical treatments is an anticipated

473
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:19,261
body.

474
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:21,990
Finally breathed his last
breath on april the fifth,

475
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:23,580
1976 so well,

476
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,120
and it was shocked when the
autopsy pictures revealed
the terrible condition of

477
00:21:27,121 --> 00:21:27,840
his body.

478
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,390
The results of undiagnosed or cd,

479
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:35,220
multiple severe head injuries and 30
years have largely selfimposed neglect.

480
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,360
It was so sad.

481
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,440
End for a truly brilliant man.

482
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,920
So I hope you enjoyed that
video about howard hughes.

483
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:43,920
