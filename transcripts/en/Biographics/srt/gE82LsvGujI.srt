1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,860
He was the king of Kung Fu,

2
00:00:01,861 --> 00:00:05,370
the deadliest human fighting machine
that the world has ever seen.

3
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,040
Bringing a new level of
excitement of the silver screen.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,160
He established himself as
the first oriental superstar
build as the fittest man

5
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,040
on the planet.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,870
He has the world at his feet.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:21,050
Then suddenly he was gone dead at the
age of 32 and the almost 50 years since

8
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:22,261
then,

9
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:26,160
his legend has propelled Bruce
Lee to mythical proportions.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,690
In this week's biographics,

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,770
we go beyond the legends and
reveal the Real Bruce Lee.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:41,720
The trials here,

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,040
the wells would knew as Bruce Lee was
born on November the 27th of 1940 and the

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,130
Jackson Street hospital in
San Francisco's China town.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,210
His mother gracefully.

16
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:51,950
It was the company in
our husbands the Axle,

17
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,490
Hawaii Chong on a tour of the United
States with a Cantonese opera company of

18
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:56,240
Hong Kong.

19
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,000
Grace named the child
Jew Fang meaning return.

20
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,600
Again,

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,160
that's the doctor delivering him,

22
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,091
nicknamed him.

23
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:06,680
Bruce Lee's stayed in San Francisco for
five months before returning to Hong

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:06,770
Kong,

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:10,640
but the heat and the humidity of
Asia did not agree with baby Bruce.

26
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,150
He became a sickly child with his
mother constantly doting on him.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Grace has already lost a Charles and it
was determined that she would not lose a

28
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:20,090
seconds.

29
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:20,923
As he grew older there,

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,010
Bruce became stronger.

31
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:22,610
In fact,

32
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:25,640
he became so active that
his mother nicknamed him,

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,840
never sits still.

34
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,760
The only time he stopped running,

35
00:01:28,761 --> 00:01:29,151
jumping,

36
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:32,720
or striking the air was when he was
curled up in the corner with a book in his

37
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:33,390
hands.

38
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,100
His long hours of reading into the nice
caused him to become near scientists and

39
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,590
at age six he required reading bosses.

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,830
Bruce grew up in a crowded bus
or flat along with his family.

41
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:46,790
There was that if his late brother so
that nearly 20 people were squashed into

42
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,200
the a chaotic household.

43
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,770
Still the leaves were among the wealthiest
families in Hong Kong along with his

44
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:52,371
opera income,

45
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:54,650
how he and received payments
from rental properties.

46
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,860
Bruce spent much of his time amusing
himself on the streets of Hong Kong.

47
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,130
He showed me listen to interest in school
and would often cut class to hang out

48
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:02,660
on the streets with local hoods.

49
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:06,170
By the time he was 10 he had developed
a pension for practical jokes.

50
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,000
These started out innocent enough,

51
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:12,290
but soon took on a more sinister touch
once he pushed his sister Phoebe into a

52
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,710
swimming pool and she retaliated by
holding his head under the water until he

53
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,060
promised to never do it again.

54
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,050
From that day on,

55
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:18,631
he promised,

56
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:18,790
dude,

57
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,760
never go in a swimming pool.

58
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:19,850
Yeah,

59
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:20,683
yeah.

60
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:25,670
Bruce is acts in Korea.

61
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:28,670
Began that just three months thanks to
his father's connections in the local

62
00:02:28,671 --> 00:02:29,720
entertainment industry.

63
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,810
His first real acting role
occurred when he was six years old.

64
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,140
He plays a rebellious streak.

65
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,150
Kids in the movie,

66
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,920
beginning of a boy in that film,

67
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:38,900
he had the first of many onscreen fights.

68
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,010
He was building this and a string of
films that followed as Lee sue long or

69
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:43,371
Leila.

70
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,204
So Dragon.

71
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,040
Bruce loved the life of a young actor.

72
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,360
Often he would be picked up.

73
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:50,900
It's 2:00 AM leaping from his beds
and excitedly rushing out the door.

74
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,980
In his later films,

75
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:56,120
he played teenage rebels who invariably
ended up in a climactic fight scene.

76
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,620
From the very start,

77
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:01,150
he developed certain trademark mannerisms
which would later become famous.

78
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,440
The admonishing finger,

79
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,030
the thumb wiped across his nose,

80
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,100
the steady unflinching gaze.

81
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,010
By the time he was 18 Bruce
had appeared in 20 films,

82
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,080
the most famous of which was the orphan,

83
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,940
which was his own leading role.

84
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,290
At the age of 12 Bruce began
attending lasalle college.

85
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,580
A Catholic boy's school is teachers
that found him to be daisy,

86
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,730
stubborn and rebellious.

87
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,720
The Chinese students of Bruce and school
felt a strong rivalry with the British

88
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,970
students who attended King
George the fifth school,

89
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:31,810
which was up the hill.

90
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,870
Bruce became the leader of a gang that
hung out after school behind the playing

91
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:36,100
field of the rival school.

92
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,500
The boys would shout taunts
at the British students.

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,800
Often with the results that fee fist
fights would break out the rumbles.

94
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,390
They were often broken up by the police.

95
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,030
Phone calls and visits by the police
became a regular occurrence of Billy

96
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,770
household.

97
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,320
His father was furious at the way,

98
00:03:49,321 --> 00:03:52,720
would cost that Bruce was taking and
imposed strict restrictions on him,

99
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,380
but he was not home enough for them
to have any real effects with fighting

100
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,760
becoming a major part of his life.

101
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,370
Bruce began thinking about
the subjects most of the time.

102
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,150
He later recalled that he always fought
with his gang behind him using chairs as

103
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,780
weapons,

104
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,481
but what was happening,

105
00:04:05,481 --> 00:04:08,710
he wonders if he got caught on his
own without his gang to back him up.

106
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,970
Could he protect himself?

107
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,690
He decided not to take any chances and
it became convinced this in order to

108
00:04:13,691 --> 00:04:14,380
survive,

109
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,650
he needed to be trained in the
most effective of the martial arts.

110
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,633
Kung Fu,

111
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,530
Bruce's father had taught
him some Tai Chi moves,

112
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,950
but the slow flowing movements where
there's this'll health and a street fight

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,560
at the age of 13 he began
learning wing Chung.

114
00:04:31,561 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm the trainer William Young.

115
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,980
Bruce threw himself into his lessons,

116
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:38,130
practicing constantly and
making rapid progress.

117
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,190
Young was so impressed with his young
students that he introduced him to his

118
00:04:41,191 --> 00:04:44,340
Mazda or revered older man named Yip man.

119
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,820
The master decided to take on
Bruce as a personal students.

120
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,541
At first,

121
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,150
Bruce was only interested in
learning how to street fight,

122
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,950
but as the lessons continued,

123
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,241
Yup.

124
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:56,790
A man introduced him to the finer
points of the OSC meditation,

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,460
breathing and balance
while training under Yep.

126
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,820
Bruce learns not only to
master the physical techniques,

127
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,230
but also to quell the interference
of emotions such as fear and anger.

128
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,690
Despite his developing
skills as a martial artist,

129
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,940
Bruce was still a troublemaker at school.

130
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:16,620
At Age 15 he was expelled from the South
College ending up at in Francis Xavier

131
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,670
College on the other side of town,

132
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,840
one of his teachers there,

133
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:23,370
brother Edward's encouraged to Bruce two
releases energies by entering the 1958

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,330
boxing championships held between his
new school and King George the fifth

135
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:27,930
school.

136
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,620
Bruce likes the idea and trained
vigorously for the upcoming challenge.

137
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,690
When the competition finally took place,

138
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,540
Bruce breezed his way through
the preliminary rounds,

139
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,890
knocking out three opponents
in the first rounds.

140
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,900
In the final,

141
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,260
he faced Gary alums who had held
the title for the last three years.

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,900
Bruce was able to use the blocking
moves he had learned from when Chung to

143
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,660
negate the power of his opponents.

144
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,890
Then in the third round,

145
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:53,190
he landed a devastating blow
which put alums on the canvas.

146
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:58,070
Bruce had won the title despite having
the prestige of being inner city boxing

147
00:05:58,071 --> 00:05:58,550
champ.

148
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,120
Bruce continued to get in trouble
with his teachers and then the police.

149
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:02,870
Finally,

150
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,410
his mother suggested that he returns
to the country of his birth to claim

151
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:10,070
citizenship before he turned 18 at
which time it would be too late.

152
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,850
His father agreed knowing that Bruce is
future depended on him getting away from

153
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:14,684
his peers.

154
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,430
On April 15th,

155
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,730
1959 Bruce gathered up his meager
belongings and set off for his three week

156
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,020
journey across the Pacific.

157
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:25,981
Before he left,

158
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:30,690
his mother slept $100 into his pockets
and his father gave him a further $15 he

159
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:33,020
was booked onto the ship
as a third class passenger,

160
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,720
but spends most of his time in first
costs by giving dance lessons to other

161
00:06:36,721 --> 00:06:37,470
passengers.

162
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:40,920
On May the 17th he fulfilled his mother's
prophecy when she names him returning

163
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:41,970
to the place of his birth.

164
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,990
San Francisco.

165
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,860
Bruce stayed with a friend of his father
making a meager income by giving dance

166
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:47,460
lessons.

167
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,590
During his first few
months in San Francisco,

168
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:53,430
he met several local karate students
who encouraged him to teach Kung Fu,

169
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,420
but Bruce,

170
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,950
he was not yet ready to make that leap.

171
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,360
A few months after arriving,

172
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,830
he moved into the boarding house,

173
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,820
really a chow,

174
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,301
a family,

175
00:07:00,301 --> 00:07:00,721
friends,

176
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:03,090
and deep began to work as
a waiter in a restaurant.

177
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:07,470
He also enrolled in Edison technical
high school when Seattle Hells and Asian

178
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:08,160
Culture Day,

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,880
teachers at the school asked to breeze
to give a kung food demonstration in the

180
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,301
audience.

181
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:14,340
That day was James de Mille format,

182
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:17,190
US army heavyweight boxing
champion scanning the audience,

183
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,890
Bruce Notice to mill and
invited him up to spar with him.

184
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,640
Do we all thought he could easily take
out the slide Chinaman but were surprised

185
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:27,450
to discover that he was unable to lay
a finger on Bruce who was able to block

186
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,670
and it's counter with deadly efficiency.

187
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,900
After the demonstration,

188
00:07:30,901 --> 00:07:32,910
demille asked Bruce to
teach him some moves.

189
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,780
Before long,

190
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,630
Bruce had a devoted core
of serious students.

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,450
Bruce applied himself to his
education for the first time,

192
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,320
earning his diploma from Edison tack
with high enough grades to be admitted to

193
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:45,360
the University of Washington in Seattle.

194
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,410
While in college,

195
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,940
he kept up with his Kung Fu training,

196
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,180
but he would not let his teaching
come before his own learning.

197
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,460
He would train it for up
to 40 hours each week,

198
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,510
developing new techniques and borrowing
from all forms in order to create the

199
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,310
most functional fighting style.

200
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,630
And in October of 1963 22 year old
Bruce quit his job at Ruby Charles

201
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,150
restaurants and opened
his own training academy,

202
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,070
the Jun Fan Gung Fu institutes.

203
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,650
He lives at the back in
a small window to swim.

204
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,580
It was around this time the Bruce awesome
as a fellow students at Washington by

205
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,080
the name of Linda Emery.

206
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,830
They began dating though Lindsay hit
the budding romance from her parents,

207
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,820
the institutes,

208
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,391
it did well.

209
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:25,260
And by 1964 Bruce was ready to open
up a larger equipment in Oakland,

210
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:25,980
California.

211
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:29,520
He closed the door of the first academy
and men told his assistant tacky camera

212
00:08:29,521 --> 00:08:33,480
to reopen the school in Chinatown as a
private club for his regular students.

213
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,190
Before opening the Oakland's Queen,

214
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,880
Bruce attended the international karate
tournament in Long Beach where he had

215
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:40,950
been invited to give a demonstration here.

216
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,140
He wowed the crowd with
his soon to be famous,

217
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:44,220
one inch punch.

218
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,000
It was here,

219
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,670
the Bruce also first Matt
Filipino martial artists,

220
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:48,960
Dan Inosanto,

221
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,910
who would become his number one students.

222
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,870
Bruce gave further demonstrations is soon
had a thriving business in Oakland's.

223
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,680
His was to build up a nest egg and then
bring Linda from Seattle where they

224
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,400
would marry,

225
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,960
but those plans were swept aside.

226
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,570
When Lindsay Roots of Bruce
saying that she was pregnant,

227
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,140
Bruce,

228
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,010
he was delighted.

229
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,080
Despite the protestations
of Linda's family,

230
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,730
they were married in a small ceremony.

231
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:13,440
On August the 17th 1964 Bruce and his
new bride moved in with James Lee and his

232
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,010
family.

233
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,670
James was a traditionally trained
Kung Fu man who was looking for a more

234
00:09:17,671 --> 00:09:19,320
practically efficient style.

235
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,810
He works with Bruce to build
up his Oakland's cal loon.

236
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,170
They offered their skills to anyone who
was seriously interested in learning how

237
00:09:25,171 --> 00:09:25,800
to fight.

238
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,820
In early 1965 they traditional
Chinese Kung Fu instructor named Wong.

239
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:33,960
Jack man earns the CPAP with teaching
Chinese secret fighting arts to

240
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:34,800
Westerners.

241
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,770
He was enraged and it's largely
to build his own reputation.

242
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,970
He challenged Bruce to a fight with a
wage at the loser would have to close his

243
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:43,830
school when long turned up for the fight.

244
00:09:43,831 --> 00:09:45,630
He half expected Bruce to back down,

245
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,510
but Bruce was hindsons ready
for action as surprised.

246
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,550
Wong tried to throw in
some last minute rules,

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,351
no ige apps,

248
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:51,961
no growing kicks,

249
00:09:51,961 --> 00:09:52,590
et Cetera,

250
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,330
that Bruce rejected them saying,

251
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,160
I'm not standing for any of that.

252
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,390
You've made the challenge.

253
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,260
It's all out.

254
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,760
It's no holds barred.

255
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,170
The match was sloppy.

256
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,420
After a few week punches longterm to run,

257
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,000
Bruce ran after him and punched
him in the back of their heads,

258
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:07,710
but he couldn't land a finishing punch.

259
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,770
One finally gave up and does entourage.

260
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,620
Dragged him off without a word Bruce was
not happy with is showing the fight had

261
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:15,660
been too messy and she had become winded.

262
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,960
It spurs him on to begin an intense
regimen of physical training,

263
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,000
which he would keep up for the rest of us

264
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,033
life.

265
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,260
February

266
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:29,320
the first 1965 Linda gave birth to a son,

267
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,980
Brandon.

268
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,790
Three days later,

269
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,800
Bruce was given his first
Hollywood screen test,

270
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,240
has stylist to the stars.

271
00:10:34,241 --> 00:10:37,900
Jay Sebring had been in attendance at
the Long Beach Karate tournaments where

272
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:41,890
Bruce had demonstrated his one inch punch
and it mentions and producers who were

273
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,350
costing roles in a new Charlie Chan movie.

274
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,310
He didn't get that role,

275
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,140
but he was offered another role as Keto,

276
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:50,020
the sidekick to the Green Hornet
and it projected TV series.

277
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,460
The series premiers on September the
ninth 1966 introducing American audiences

278
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:55,810
to come through for the first time.

279
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,990
Young viewers were amazed
at what they saw and Cato,

280
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,510
the sidekick soon became
the real star of the show.

281
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,540
Bruce began making personal
appearances all over the country.

282
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,321
Unfortunately,

283
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:08,410
the Green Hornet wasn't such a hit
with adult audiences who saw it as too

284
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:11,140
unrealistic and too much
of a copycat of Batman.

285
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:13,090
After 26 weekly episodes,

286
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:13,983
it was canceled.

287
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,380
Despite its popularity as Keto
Nunu roles popped up for briefs.

288
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,710
He did manage to make a little cash
with guest appearances on long street

289
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:21,090
blondie,

290
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,770
and here comes the bride's once again,

291
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,120
the he turned his energies
to teaching Kung Fu,

292
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,750
although he never intended it.

293
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,590
His techniques seem developed
into a new fighting school.

294
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,420
He called it [inaudible] Condo,

295
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,100
the way of the intercepting
fist in February of 1967
and Bruce opened his third

296
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,550
Kuhn and is Chinatown just a
few blocks from dodger stadium.

297
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,250
At the suggestion of the Green
Hornets assistant producer,

298
00:11:42,251 --> 00:11:46,870
he raised his fees from $22 per
month to as much as $50 per hour.

299
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:47,441
Eventually,

300
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:51,220
his rates went up to $250 per
hour with director Roman Polanski,

301
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:55,780
even flying him out to Switzerland for
private celebrity students included Steve

302
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:55,781
McQueen,

303
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,030
Lee Corbin and Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

304
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,270
He also trained established martial
art masters including Chuck Norris,

305
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:01,841
Joe Louis,

306
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:02,674
and Mike Stone.

307
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,340
Between them,

308
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:07,120
those three had won every major karate
championship in the United States.

309
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,080
On April the 19th 1969 Lindsey
gave birth to a daughter Shannon.

310
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:11,973
A few weeks later.

311
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,330
Bruce suffered a severe back injury
while lifting a 125 pound barbell.

312
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,490
The doctor had told him
to forget to Kung Fu,

313
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,650
you wouldn't have a kick
again for three months.

314
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:23,590
He lay flat on his back and
fell into a deep depression.

315
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,521
After six months,

316
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:28,330
he finally began training again working
through his pain in a short amount of

317
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:28,690
time.

318
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:30,010
He was back to his own self.

319
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,850
It was at the same time the Bruce
was working with screenwriters,

320
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:36,940
sterling silver fans and actor Lee Marvin
or what was to be his breakout film,

321
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,050
the silent flute.

322
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,730
The film never got to the shooting stage,

323
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,880
but cellophane did get Bruce
a cameo on the TV series.

324
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,733
Long Street.

325
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,880
Shortly after shooting
the Long Street episode,

326
00:12:45,881 --> 00:12:49,360
Bruce flew to Hong Kong to arrange for
his now widowed mother to come and live

327
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,500
in the United States.

328
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,820
When he stepped off the plane,

329
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,230
he was shocked at the reaction.

330
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:56,260
The Green Horn is had been playing in
movie theaters and did it made Bruce the

331
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,160
Chinese hero.

332
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,390
He was bombarded by reporters and spent
the next two weeks doing the rounds of

333
00:13:01,391 --> 00:13:03,130
the local TV talk shows.

334
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,430
Bruisers fame did not escape the attention
of the key players in the Hong Kong

335
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,210
film industry.

336
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:08,050
The shore brothers,

337
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,670
they produced two thirds of the
Chinese films in the wells vans walls,

338
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,370
a film production assembly line with
actors and crew being grossly underpaid.

339
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:20,130
They offered Bruce a seven year contracts
for just $2,000 per film and tighten

340
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,860
them down.

341
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:24,460
Then Bruce was approached by Raymond
Chow with Golden Harvest Studios who

342
00:13:24,461 --> 00:13:26,560
offered $15,000 for two movies.

343
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,190
Bruce,

344
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,380
while he signed on the
dotted line and the rest,

345
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,333
as they say,

346
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,173
is history.

347
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,470
Bruce,

348
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,090
his first major role as an
adult was in the big boss.

349
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,520
The film was shot in Bangkok
in the middle of a heat wave.

350
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,540
We've no air conditioning,

351
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,370
polluted water and no fresh food.

352
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,040
It was hardly the star's life
that Bruce had dreamed of,

353
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,650
but it was all worth it because
he was finally on his way.

354
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,360
The big boss Premiers in October of 1971
Bruce and Linda sat in the audience in

355
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:50,470
nervous anticipation.

356
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,660
The movie ended to complete silence.

357
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,880
Then utter chaos broke out.

358
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:59,170
The ecstatic crowd practically mobbed as
you tried to leave the fares out within

359
00:13:59,171 --> 00:13:59,711
three weeks,

360
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:02,380
the film took in more than
$3 million in Hong Kong.

361
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,820
Smashing all records.

362
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,590
Bruce's second film for Golden Harvest,

363
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:07,840
fists of fury was even more popular.

364
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:08,800
Smashing the record.

365
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:10,900
Saps by the big boss on the streets,

366
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:13,270
sold out tickets went for $50 a pop.

367
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,020
Bruce,

368
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,000
it become a superstar almost overnight.

369
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,120
Suddenly he was unable to walk down
the street without drawing a crowd,

370
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,530
but it's adding to the United States.

371
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,380
Bruce was excited about a new TV
series that was in production,

372
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,180
tentatively called for warrior.

373
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,260
It was the story of a Chinese Shaolin
monk who gets transplanted in the American

374
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:29,830
West.

375
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,450
Bruce desperately wanted the pot,

376
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,960
yet he was shocked and disappointed to
learn that he was considered to Chinese

377
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:35,550
for the role.

378
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,370
You remember him.

379
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:38,200
He was supposed to play
the role of a Chinese man.

380
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,390
The Bob was actually given to an
American accent named David Cara.

381
00:14:41,391 --> 00:14:45,910
Diane Ans retitled Kung Fu briefs dealt
with this rejection by throwing himself

382
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:47,020
into his next project.

383
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,470
A film.

384
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,400
He rose by himself,

385
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:49,780
called the way of the Dragon.

386
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,250
He decided to do this
completely by himself.

387
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,290
He would produce direct cost,

388
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,350
choreograph scout locations
and star in the movie.

389
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,360
He even played percussion
for the movie soundtrack.

390
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,500
The movie was shot only $130,000
budget on location in Rome.

391
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,550
In the climactic scene,

392
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:08,870
Bruce recreated a one-on-one
gladiatorial contest with Chuck Norris.

393
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,640
Way Of the dragon was a smash hit.

394
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:14,000
It's taken in five point $5 million
in Hong Kong alone in the wake of its

395
00:15:14,001 --> 00:15:14,450
release.

396
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,630
Bruce had planned to take some time off
to recover from his grueling schedule.

397
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,080
In October of 1972 he
has the basketball star,

398
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:23,090
Kareem Abdul Jabbar was in Hong Kong.

399
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,150
He quickly arranged some action
sequences with a seven foot,

400
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:29,360
two inch form of students that
could be used in this next project,

401
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,313
game of death,

402
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:30,981
having shots,

403
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,660
20 minutes of footage
of the game of death.

404
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,870
Bruce finally got the call from Hollywood
that he had been waiting for for so

405
00:15:35,871 --> 00:15:36,500
long.

406
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,380
Warner brothers now saw Bruce
as a bankable commodity.

407
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,920
They wanted him to start in a US s
martial arts film as we're willing to give

408
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:44,780
them complete control
over the fight scenes.

409
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,330
The entire feature was
called enter the Dragon.

410
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,840
The filming of enter the Dragon placed
enormous demands on Bruce's physical

411
00:15:50,841 --> 00:15:51,320
energy.

412
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,310
You couldn't sleep at night.

413
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,550
He lost weight and to skin pales
and he started to look ill.

414
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,140
We're filming wraps up Bruce Sands and
a tiny dubbing room on May the 10th 1973

415
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:03,050
looping dialogue in order
to achieve complete silence.

416
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,460
The air conditioning was shutoff.

417
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,400
Bruce went to the bathroom to
wash his face and collapsed.

418
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,100
He was seized with a fit of
vomiting and struggled to breathe.

419
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,030
Rush to the hospital.

420
00:16:11,031 --> 00:16:15,320
He was diagnosed with cerebral edema
and then released around noon on January

421
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,790
the 20th 1973 Bruce Santini as Hong
Kong study hunched over his books and

422
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:20,390
papers.

423
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,190
Around 2:00 PM Raymond Chow arrived.

424
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,130
You've discussed script ideas for
game of death staying for two hours.

425
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,100
In the early evening.

426
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,690
Bruce drove over to the apartment of
Betty Ting Pei and actress who had wanted

427
00:16:29,691 --> 00:16:30,920
to play a lead role in the film.

428
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,320
Around seven 30 Bruce complained of a
headache and asked Betty if he could lay

429
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:35,060
on her bed.

430
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,500
The parotid glands image Raymond Chow,

431
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:37,520
which a restaurant for dinner.

432
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,290
When Betsy went into rouse Bruce,

433
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,400
she was unable to wake him.

434
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,360
She called Chow,

435
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,130
who rushed over unable to wake Bruce.

436
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:44,060
They called for a doctor,

437
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,260
the martial arts superstar.

438
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:46,340
He was rushed to hospital,

439
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,510
but nothing could be done.

440
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,260
Bruce Lee with stat on the
cusp of worldwide domination,

441
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,090
