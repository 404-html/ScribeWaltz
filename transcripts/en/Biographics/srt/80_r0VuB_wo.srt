1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,190
Just before we jump into the video today,

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:04,050
I do want to say that
this guy is a gentleman,

3
00:00:04,051 --> 00:00:07,530
his name is John Hub and I hope
I'm pronouncing that right Germans,

4
00:00:07,531 --> 00:00:09,960
but I do want to say for
all of the viewers today,

5
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:11,880
I'm probably going to screw
that up at some point.

6
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:13,620
I'm probably just going to
go with calling him John,

7
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:14,160
rob,

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,880
because it's easier for me to pronounce
rather than trying with the whole thing

9
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:18,714
for the whole video.

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,060
So that's that out of the way.

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
Let's get into it.

12
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,580
What would you think of a man
who supported the greatest
mass murder machine in

13
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:27,450
human history?

14
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,950
A man who was proud to stands by a
genocidal dictator who nearly destroyed

15
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,560
Europe,

16
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,190
a man proud to call himself a Nazi.

17
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,920
What do you find him sickening or evil?

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:38,431
Well,

19
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,240
maybe not.

20
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,490
If he was John Rob high ranking Nazi.

21
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,070
Rob was an ardent
supporter of adult Hitler,

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,990
but he was also something else.

23
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:50,130
He was perhaps the greatest
humanitarian that you've never heard of,

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,070
known as the Good Nazi of Nan.

25
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:56,310
King Rab was the third reichs man in
China when the capital felons and Japan's

26
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:00,660
German aligned forces faced with the
imperial armies genocidal actions.

27
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:02,790
He did something wholly unexpected.

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:06,300
He tried to save the lives of
every Chinese civilian in the city.

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:08,130
Over six incredible weeks,

30
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:11,010
John Rob stood at the
epicenter of a bloodbath,

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,040
single handedly protecting nine kings
residents from a well winds of rape and

32
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:17,160
murder.

33
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,160
He is today credited with saving 250,000
lives and deeded all of this while

34
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:25,080
still staying loyal to adult Hitler.

35
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,940
Today we delve into the fascinating
story of history's good Nazi.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,390
When Joan Rob was born in
Hamburg on November the 23rd 18,

37
00:01:46,391 --> 00:01:47,020
82.

38
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,020
It was into a world that was on the cusp
of a dramatic change just a year before

39
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:56,140
the rising state of Germany had delivered
a surprise knockout blow to France in

40
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,870
the Franco Prussian war
for rob's contemporaries.

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:02,290
That men's growing up at a
time of unbridled optimism,

42
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,700
not that rubbed salt marsh have it taken
out of school as a young age when his

43
00:02:06,701 --> 00:02:10,810
ship captain and father suddenly died
and stuck into an unhappy apprenticeship.

44
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,720
Young John was a boy,

45
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:16,090
always hoping to escape
Germany and see the world,

46
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,070
and so he did in 19.

47
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:18,201
Oh,

48
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:18,611
three.

49
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:23,020
The 21 year old rob set out
for the Portuguese African
colony of Lutheran qualm

50
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,811
mark now,

51
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,240
and the pewter in Mozambique,

52
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,400
it seems he planned to
stay there long term,

53
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:31,210
but an outbreak of malaria forced him
to resend it to Hamburg after just three

54
00:02:31,211 --> 00:02:32,520
years for John.

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,290
This was a blessing in
disguise back in Hamburg.

56
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,670
He met up with an old school crush named
Dora and was delighted to discover that

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,740
she was into him to the two quarter.

58
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,320
They fell in love and became
these sickening German
version of those loved other

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,020
couples who can't spend a single second
to pause if John has been a slightly

60
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:51,130
more average man,

61
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,750
well that would've been it,

62
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,680
but John,

63
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,970
he wasn't San Fridge despite looking
like a Nan cast by a which to forever

64
00:02:57,971 --> 00:02:59,650
resemble a certified accountant.

65
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,250
John Rob had an adventurous
soul three years in Africa.

66
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,320
It simply hasn't been enough for him.

67
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,670
So in Nineteen Oh eight,

68
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:08,590
he presented Dora with a plan.

69
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,740
The two of them would move to Shanghai
rather than ask if a new lover Gone Mad.

70
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,990
Dora replied with the early 20th
century dramatic equivalence of how yes,

71
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,350
neither of them could have known they'd
chosen to move to a kingdom on the verge

72
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,520
of catastrophe.

73
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,630
On November the 15th,

74
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,070
1,980 to the dowager,

75
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:31,660
empress 60 breathed her last in
the imperio gardens of Beijing.

76
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,090
The power behind the
throne in China since 18,

77
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,841
65,

78
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:39,841
her passing left the ching
dynasty dangerously unstabled
already left reeling by

79
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,490
the recent boxer rebellion.

80
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,790
The family that had ruled China
over 250 years at that last,

81
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,660
it's matriarch.

82
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,170
16,

83
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:50,800
was replaced on the threatened by her
two year old pui and spoiled her and I

84
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:51,101
said,

85
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:56,101
don't bother memorizing that name as
the aftershocks of sixties death rumbled

86
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:57,550
through Chinese society,

87
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,560
John Andorra,

88
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,030
they were entering a new
era of their own in 19 Oh,

89
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:02,321
nine.

90
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,330
The young couple married in 1910.

91
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:07,450
John got a position as a clerk
in a Siemens office in Beijing.

92
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,060
It was a position that will allow them
to rise up quickly through the ranks,

93
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,360
becoming a pillar of the
German ex pat community.

94
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:18,510
It was also a position that would give
him a front row seat as China exploded.

95
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,410
That's an old Chinese curse that goes,

96
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,900
may you live in interesting times.

97
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,490
Well Times in China.

98
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,340
They were certainly
about to get interesting.

99
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,330
On October the 10th,

100
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:35,781
Nineteen,

101
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:36,110
11,

102
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:40,580
the city of Wu Chang exploded in
rebellion against the emperor boy.

103
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,140
This lit the fuse on roughly
a bazillion of a powder kegs,

104
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:46,340
and in no time at all,

105
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,780
half of China was in revolt known
as the zing high revolution.

106
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:55,781
It ended when six year old
boy you abdicated in January
of 1912 ending the Ching

107
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:01,220
Dynasty for a revolution that closed
the door on 2000 years of imperial rule,

108
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:02,690
the sing high revolution.

109
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,340
It went remarkably smoothly.

110
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,450
China was declared a republic and you on
Chicago became its head like most other

111
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:09,320
German ex pats.

112
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:09,711
Gentleman,

113
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,544
Dora Rave,

114
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:14,000
almost totally unaffected by these
southern changeover of power.

115
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:14,601
However,

116
00:05:14,601 --> 00:05:18,810
the same cannot be said for
the next problem that was
going to afflict China and

117
00:05:18,811 --> 00:05:20,720
out of course was world war one.

118
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,111
Okay.

119
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:21,561
At this point,

120
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:25,430
we probably need to backtrack a little
for a quick historical explainer.

121
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,730
For about 300 years before
their abs had arrived,

122
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,580
China had been the most
powerful nation in the east.

123
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,680
Then in 18,

124
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,470
53,

125
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,470
a guy called Commodore Perry led a fleet
of ships into Edo Bay just outside of

126
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:43,430
Tokyo and threatens to blast the city
into rubble and less Japan opened up its

127
00:05:43,431 --> 00:05:44,030
economy.

128
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,510
The result was the opening of
Japan under the Meiji government,

129
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,340
good news for American trade.

130
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,410
Very bad news for China.

131
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,400
This new Japan.

132
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,960
It quickly became a regional powerhouse
as China lumbered along and also find

133
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,400
Japan started throwing its weight
around like a sumo wrestler,

134
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,490
receiving electroshock therapy in 18,

135
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:05,061
95,

136
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:08,870
Japan even warped Beijing and
the first sign of Japanese war.

137
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,220
This was an epic humiliation for trainer
and it got even more epic when Germany

138
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:17,180
took advantage of China's
weakness to occupy Qingdao in 18,

139
00:06:17,181 --> 00:06:17,900
97,

140
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:22,100
setting up the German Shendong when
World War One to finally rolled around.

141
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
China was eager to reclaim
the stolen territory.

142
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,420
Unfortunately,

143
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,283
Tokyo,

144
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,930
they weren't done
humiliating them just yet.

145
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,981
And late 19,

146
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,400
14,

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,630
Japan in Britain joined forces to
invade chandon kicking for Germans out.

148
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,140
One of Tokyo's conditions for joining
the fight was the China wouldn't be

149
00:06:39,141 --> 00:06:40,310
allowed to get involved.

150
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,200
The allies agreed with China
castrated as effectively as a unit.

151
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,100
Japan gobbled up a small
territory taking south Manchuria.

152
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,280
In the war's aftermath,

153
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,100
the allies pressed China to officially
seed Shendong and south Manchuria to

154
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:55,730
Japan.

155
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,410
Japan was further empowered and China
was further humiliated perhaps in

156
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:00,900
response.

157
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,270
Nineteen,

158
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:01,721
19,

159
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,720
sore trying to kick out.

160
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,430
It's German expats
including John and Dora.

161
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,020
Rob,

162
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,330
despite having lived in
China for more than a decade,

163
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,530
suddenly they were personas non grata the
death of president you on Chicago back

164
00:07:12,531 --> 00:07:15,230
in 1916 had by 1919,

165
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:20,090
triggered a collapse of Chinese society
known as the warlord era with China

166
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:23,780
Balkanizing into competing states
constantly at war with one another.

167
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,670
The city is desperately needed.

168
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:29,360
Foreign expertise to stop
themselves from including before 19,

169
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:30,470
19 was even out.

170
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,510
John Andorra.

171
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,490
Rob had been but
grudgingly invited back in

172
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,683
the warlord era.

173
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:46,130
It came to a close in 1928 when
nationalist troops led by Chiang Kai Shek

174
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,250
succeeded in reunifying China by force.

175
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,240
They established a new capital and non
king beginning something called the

176
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,500
[inaudible] decade.

177
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:59,450
It was a time of prosperity that China
had not seen since before World War One,

178
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,380
the economy,

179
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,130
it boomed,

180
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,910
stability,

181
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:02,660
rains,

182
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,550
and people's lives improved.

183
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,820
Among them was John Rob
throughout the warlord era.

184
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:08,990
This quiet gentleman,

185
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:13,400
businessmen hood plugged away with
typical central European efficiency rising

186
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,500
through the ranks of
Siemens Asian division,

187
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,240
even as China crumbled all around him
in the boom times of the Nanking Decade,

188
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,520
Siemens Made Rob Managing Director.

189
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:23,660
If it's Chinese division,

190
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,420
it's a license.

191
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,310
John Andorra,

192
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:27,890
they moved to nanking in 1931,

193
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,210
but 1931 was also the year that the
wheels started to come off the new era.

194
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,550
On September the 18th,

195
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:38,840
Japanese forces used the pretext of a
terrorist attack in south Manchuria to

196
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,580
invade Manchuria proper,

197
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:45,620
setting up a pro Japanese puppet state
under our old friends and per a per year.

198
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,720
Rather than fight this new aggression,

199
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,290
the Chinese did something that
probably seemed smart at the time,

200
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,020
but in retrospect does look a bit stupid.

201
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,170
They took their case to the League of
nations set up in the wake of World War

202
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:58,171
One.

203
00:08:58,171 --> 00:09:02,160
The League of nations was meant to settle
disputes between nations without the

204
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,030
need for war.

205
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,740
In fact,

206
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,400
though,

207
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,850
it was pretty weakened toothless.

208
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,850
When it concluded the Japanese had
been wronged to invade Manchuria.

209
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,080
The Tokyo delegation stormed
off rather than cool tensions.

210
00:09:13,081 --> 00:09:17,640
The League had actually raised them the
things they wouldn't explode just yet.

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,451
Back in then,

212
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:19,171
King John,

213
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:22,710
rob was becoming the most important
westerner in all of China.

214
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,790
In 1934,

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,060
he opens a German school on his
property and made himself the chairman.

216
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,410
This brought you into contact for
the first time with the Nazi party.

217
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,101
I'm saying,

218
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,420
yeah,

219
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,880
of Hitler had become Germany's
unchallenged dick data,

220
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:36,720
and yes,

221
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:40,680
the emphasis on the first syllable
there was fully intentional in this doc,

222
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:45,390
new world being a public German to
figure being a Nazi even if you lived in

223
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,224
China,

224
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,980
but this wasn't a problem for
rob already loved Nazi-ism.

225
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:53,670
Historians struggled to
reconcile the humanitarian.

226
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:55,890
John Rob with the fascist drawn rob,

227
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,530
although he joined the party late in 1934,

228
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:01,290
rob quickly became one of
Hitler's biggest cheerleaders.

229
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:02,610
He wrote of the regime,

230
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,790
I believe not only in the
correctness of our political system,

231
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,740
but as an organizer of the party.

232
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,800
I am behind the system 100 percent.

233
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:11,580
Remember,

234
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,020
this is a man who had many Chinese
friends who consider China his home,

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,790
and Harry was throwing his support behind
a system that considered the Chinese

236
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,750
inferior.

237
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:26,250
The best gas historians have is that
Ray does an ex pat 5,000 miles away from

238
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:26,730
home,

239
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,000
was unaware of national socialisms racism.

240
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,050
At the same time,

241
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:35,550
he was enthused by the socialism part
with its emphasis on protecting the

242
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,990
dignity of the working man.

243
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Whatever the truth relevant soon rose
up the ranks of the party and became the

244
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,780
leading Nazi and Nan King.

245
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,860
It was arise that would come inside with
one of the worst atrocities in modern

246
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:47,694
history.

247
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
On July the seventh,

248
00:10:54,441 --> 00:10:54,831
19,

249
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:55,401
37,

250
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,020
a skirmish broke out on the market,

251
00:10:57,021 --> 00:10:59,990
Podo bridge between Chinese
and Japanese forces.

252
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:04,190
It was just one of many such clashes
that happens following the occupation of

253
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:04,881
Manchuria,

254
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,190
but this time something went wrong.

255
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,600
The kind of progressed into a battle and
the battle progressed and do a Japanese

256
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:16,220
invasion and the invasion of
that progressed into a wall.

257
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,090
That's right.

258
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,890
The second sign,

259
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,411
Japanese,

260
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:23,180
will it adjust begun and it would make
the first one look like a bit of a stroll

261
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:24,014
in the park,

262
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,340
right from the off.

263
00:11:25,341 --> 00:11:27,830
The imperial army
steamrolled across China.

264
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,030
In no time at all.

265
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,780
They were converging upon nanking as Balm,

266
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,390
as rains,

267
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,040
fiery death down on the city.

268
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,180
All of those with money,

269
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,940
they flat among them were John and rob,

270
00:11:37,941 --> 00:11:41,540
who joined a tight of western is
streaming away for the relative safety of

271
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,980
places like p Tire,

272
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,510
but Joel and Dora,

273
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,350
they were never ones to lay low and
avoid danger on September the 20.

274
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:48,920
First,

275
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:52,070
they pretend to nat king as John
would later write in his diary.

276
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,130
He didn't just to protect his property
because he felt he had a duty to his

277
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:01,060
Chinese employees and his where we
get to the really difficult part.

278
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:05,110
Rob Didn't return to help
nanking in spite of being a Nazi.

279
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,510
He did it because he was a Nazi,

280
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,820
as hard as it might be for us to stomach.

281
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,800
It was the ideology of Nazi-ism that
made rob feel that he had to stay

282
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,270
protecting his Chinese workers as the
fearer was protecting Germany's working

283
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:20,830
men by October,

284
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,530
barely at 20 westerners
remained in the city.

285
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,120
As the Imperial Army closed in,

286
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,000
rob cooled the other experts to his
house and 14 responded among them.

287
00:12:29,001 --> 00:12:30,850
The American doctor Robert Wilson.

288
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,650
We have to do something.

289
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,810
Rob told them that something
was the Nanking Safety Zone.

290
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,500
Rob's plan with symbol,

291
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,110
despite being completely on arms.

292
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,380
The 14 westerners would unilaterally
established a two and a half square mile

293
00:12:44,381 --> 00:12:46,480
zone of neutrality in Nanking,

294
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,040
centered on Rob's house and the German
school surrounded by white flags.

295
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,770
It would protect as many
Chinese civilians is necessary.

296
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,700
When word got on to the advancing imperial
army at dispatched to major archives.

297
00:12:57,701 --> 00:13:00,370
You try and talk to this
crazy German out of staying.

298
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,660
As rob later recalled,

299
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,670
Daca came to him in person and asked,

300
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,530
why in the devil did you stay?

301
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,920
Why do you want to involve
yourself in our military affairs?

302
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,140
What does all of this matter to you?

303
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,720
You haven't lost anything here.

304
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,590
Looking at the major in the eye,

305
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,820
John Rob replied,

306
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,000
I've been living here in
China for over 30 years.

307
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,570
My kids and grandchildren
were born here and I'm happy.

308
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm successful here.

309
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:28,540
If I had spent 30 years in Japan and
were treated just as well by the Japanese

310
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:29,170
people,

311
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:32,510
you can be assured that in a
time of emergency sop chances,

312
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,300
the situation China faces now,

313
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,110
I would not leave the site
of the people in Japan.

314
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,880
The loyalty and rub statement,

315
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,490
it seemed to touch
something in the major soul,

316
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,990
agreed rob could stay in the zone and
there's no harm would come to him.

317
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,130
Unfortunately,

318
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:52,360
he said nothing about what would happen
to any Chinese men that rob tried to

319
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,700
shelter is full,

320
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,780
gave way to a bidder,

321
00:13:54,781 --> 00:13:59,380
wins a rob Wilson and others plastered
nanking and posters telling citizens

322
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:00,660
about the zone Raul,

323
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:04,480
but even personally sent a telegram to
and asking him to request the Japanese

324
00:14:04,481 --> 00:14:06,100
acknowledged the zone as neutrality.

325
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,560
You can probably guess how that one went
during the last few days before nanking

326
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,070
fell rather dramatically draped buildings
in the zone with vast Nazi flags

327
00:14:15,071 --> 00:14:17,110
hoping to determine our Japanese moments.

328
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
He had swastikas painted on walls,

329
00:14:19,361 --> 00:14:21,400
deck his car out and party Regalia,

330
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,740
and took to wearing his uniform in public
at the last moments and hangings may

331
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:28,870
or officially handed power
over to rob and fled the city.

332
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:29,391
Now,

333
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:30,130
all robin,

334
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,880
the rest of his ex pats could do
was wait on December the 11th,

335
00:14:33,881 --> 00:14:34,540
heavy shelling.

336
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,120
It started as the bombardment increased.

337
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:39,970
The last Chinese in the
capital flooded into the zone,

338
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,960
a quarter of a million people
a converged on rob's property,

339
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:44,980
sleeping in ditches,

340
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,570
cramming themselves into tents,

341
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,290
climbing across one another just to
be less than it was a wave of human

342
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,124
desperation,

343
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,140
unlike anything the
westerners I'd ever seen.

344
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,153
Two nights later,

345
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,020
rob stood at a window with Dora watching
the columns of flames to the south and

346
00:15:00,021 --> 00:15:00,980
his garden below,

347
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:05,540
a crawling massive humanity wailed and
screamed and begged for their lives as

348
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:07,490
the screaming and the
shedding grew louder.

349
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:10,100
Rob finally snaps doning the metal helmet.

350
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,280
He's straight into the garden and
screamed at the refugees to shut off.

351
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,380
He said that it was all going to be fine.

352
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,180
The Japanese would treat them fairly.

353
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,980
He was absolutely sure of it,

354
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:19,971
but his words,

355
00:15:19,971 --> 00:15:22,200
they were lost in the din of the gunfire.

356
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,300
If they had carried,

357
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,370
it's unlikely anyone
would have heated them.

358
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,080
It was December the 13th,

359
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:27,501
19,

360
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:29,300
37 and apocalypse.

361
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,403
It was in the APP.

362
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,700
As the flames roared,

363
00:15:31,701 --> 00:15:31,971
Har,

364
00:15:31,971 --> 00:15:33,950
the refugees huddle type together,

365
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,690
whatever happens next,

366
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,360
they knew that it would not be fine.

367
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,650
On the morning of December,

368
00:15:44,651 --> 00:15:48,280
the 14th drawn rub awoke to
a city blanketed in eerie,

369
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:48,850
calm,

370
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,661
daunting as uniform.

371
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:51,280
He ventured out into the cold,

372
00:15:51,281 --> 00:15:52,810
empty streets beyond the zone,

373
00:15:52,811 --> 00:15:56,950
wondering what he would find out that
the roads of Nanking when littered with

374
00:15:56,951 --> 00:15:57,431
corpses,

375
00:15:57,431 --> 00:16:00,130
hundreds of civilians lay
lifeless in the streets,

376
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:05,131
shot in the back as they flat bodies of
women had been mutilated their vaginas

377
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,140
penetrated by Ben Blades.

378
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,280
On a street corner,

379
00:16:09,281 --> 00:16:13,390
rob found a small contingent of
Japanese troops losing a German cafe.

380
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:14,710
When he tried to stop them,

381
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,810
they laughed.

382
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,200
Well though they didn't harm rob,

383
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,150
they burned the cafe down.

384
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:24,330
Amused buys impotence as he returned from
this unsettling expedition Rob Pasta,

385
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,510
but dragos bunch of 400 Chinese
army regulars trying to retreat.

386
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:29,740
They were exhausted,

387
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,480
stumbling cutoff from safety.

388
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,200
The sight of them was so pitiful that rob
told the soldiers that they could take

389
00:16:35,201 --> 00:16:38,410
refuge in the zone on the one
condition that they disarmed.

390
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:42,970
You still felt set in the imperial army
would respect the zones neutrality.

391
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:43,810
That's an eit.

392
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,301
Diplomat,

393
00:16:44,301 --> 00:16:46,450
Katsuaki Ozaki cooled on rob,

394
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:48,610
who was still acting as
the mayor of the city.

395
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,550
He informed the gentleman
that received intelligence,

396
00:16:51,551 --> 00:16:53,170
that soldiers were in the zone.

397
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:55,270
He told rob that have to be arrested,

398
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:57,730
but he assured him that no
harm would come to them,

399
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,320
unable to do anything else.

400
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,510
Rob agreed over the next few days,

401
00:17:01,511 --> 00:17:04,750
Japanese fight as much through the
zone looking for Chinese soldiers.

402
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,590
That method for detection was to look
for calluses on my hands from firing

403
00:17:08,591 --> 00:17:10,120
rifles to rob's Hora.

404
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,690
Thousands of young men
were dragged from the zone.

405
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,150
The vast majority of them rickshaw
drivers and workers who had been wrongly

406
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:16,984
identified.

407
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:19,840
They went lines up just
outside and machine guns.

408
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,180
That bodies being dumped into ponds.

409
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:26,380
It was Joan Rob's first encounter with
the brutality of the imperial army,

410
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,590
and it would not be his last
as the tends December days,

411
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:34,170
past dream as began to drift into the
zone of atrocities being committed outside

412
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,990
of it that were reports of Japanese
soldiers going from house to house looking

413
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:39,850
for women's or rape age.

414
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,840
It was an austin issue.

415
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,370
There were reports of abuse.

416
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:44,770
Girls who were so young that the soldiers,

417
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,530
they type in their genitals so
that they could fit in sight.

418
00:17:47,531 --> 00:17:47,920
Them.

419
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,670
Boys were forced at gunpoint
to rape their own mothers.

420
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,590
Men Right there,

421
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,231
I daughters,

422
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,610
women who'd been abused,

423
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:55,290
sexually tortured to death.

424
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,230
That genitals mutilated in the zone.

425
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,830
John Rob,

426
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:03,030
listen to these reports with a
mounting Hora again and again.

427
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:05,820
He petitioned the Japanese
offices who did nothing.

428
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,550
He Telegrams Gemini and demanded help,

429
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,630
but nothing came just before
Christmas of 1937 something,

430
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:16,740
and then it seems to have snapped cuffs
off from the rest of the wells in a city

431
00:18:16,741 --> 00:18:17,670
that had gone mad.

432
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,400
Rob came to an inescapable conclusion.

433
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:22,590
If he wanted these atrocities to stop,

434
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,830
he would have to do something
to stop them himself.

435
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,920
And this begins the inspiring
chapter of John Rob's life.

436
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:31,200
The moments when he did something so mad,

437
00:18:31,201 --> 00:18:32,250
so courageous,

438
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:36,570
he can only be called a hero
with nanking burning around him.

439
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,820
Rob Dressed in his Nazi regalia,

440
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:40,710
left the relative safety of the zone,

441
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,210
completely unarmed.

442
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,790
He set out to save the city's residence.

443
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,890
This was nothing short of insanity.

444
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Rob might have been protected
by the imperial armies offices,

445
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:52,950
but it was very loose
protection out on the streets.

446
00:18:52,951 --> 00:18:57,300
He was just a man and a man without a
gun who was staring down the bayonets of

447
00:18:57,301 --> 00:18:58,470
Japanese soldiers,

448
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,450
and yet that is walked.

449
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,000
He did day off today as the southern
crawled up into the winter sky,

450
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,770
rob would leave the zone
listening to cries of help.

451
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:12,480
The telltale screams he would follow these
streaks until he founds the marauding

452
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,250
soldiers storm right up to them,

453
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:18,540
shove his swastika armband in their faces
and give them a brutal dressing down.

454
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,673
Amazingly,

455
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,040
it worked terrified by this
German barking orders at them.

456
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,450
The soldiers they fled.

457
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,560
Rob would then take the girl that had
been abusing out to his car and instruct

458
00:19:28,561 --> 00:19:30,390
the driver to take her to the zone.

459
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,400
Then it's simply carry on walking,

460
00:19:32,401 --> 00:19:33,810
looking for the next woman in trouble,

461
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,210
and then the next and the next.

462
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,530
Now it's really impossible to
overstate just how crazy this was.

463
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,200
Rob could have been
killed hundreds of times.

464
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,480
Yeah.

465
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,180
There was something
that bounces authority,

466
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:49,590
something about the way he wielded as
Nazi policy membership that put the fear

467
00:19:49,591 --> 00:19:51,300
of God into the Imperial Army.

468
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:51,990
Elsewhere.

469
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,860
The Nazi swastika became a
symbol of hate and rob's hands.

470
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,230
It became a symbol of hope.

471
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,820
Yet rob was not just some silent angel
passing through the hell of Nanking.

472
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,930
He was a man capable of understanding
the need for warmth for humanity.

473
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:10,110
He endora organized a birthday
parties for children in the zone,

474
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,190
singing songs.

475
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:13,980
His death and demons clawed at the doors,

476
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,970
unsurprisingly,

477
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,190
most of the boys bone
in the zone that winter.

478
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,040
They were named John Roberts.

479
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,900
He managed to win over his fellow western.

480
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,220
Dr Wilson was a staunch Anti Nazi.

481
00:20:23,221 --> 00:20:25,560
You considered anyone who
joined the party evil.

482
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,920
Yet even he grew to respect this one Nazi.

483
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,790
Even if he could never understand how
rob could be so good while supporting

484
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,440
something that was so evil.

485
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,910
Six weeks off to the zones,

486
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:37,290
first refugees arrived,

487
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,160
the end,

488
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,090
it finally came in the dying.

489
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,790
It's not cold days of January.

490
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:42,780
The imperial armies.

491
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:43,570
Hi Andrea,

492
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,170
so had control over
their forces in Nan king.

493
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:49,150
They marched into the zone
and remove the refugees.

494
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,031
I collaborate to.

495
00:20:50,031 --> 00:20:53,170
Government was set up
as the rapes with stops.

496
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,640
In a cruel irony,

497
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:58,840
the imperial army triumphantly proclaims
that that restored order to the city

498
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,501
today.

499
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:03,880
It's estimated that a minimum of 20,000
women were raped during the full of

500
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:04,690
nanking.

501
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,310
The widely accepted death dull.

502
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,400
It ranges from 100,000 to
300,000 prisoners of war
were decapitated with swords.

503
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,350
They were blown up with land mines.

504
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:18,400
They were doused in petrol
and set on fire in Japan.

505
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,830
Many still deny that the rape of nanking,

506
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,590
if it happens less than
a month off to the zone,

507
00:21:23,591 --> 00:21:24,424
was dismantled.

508
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,870
Rob Got a call from Siemens ordering
him and him to Germany packing as many

509
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,270
films and photos of the
massacre as he could.

510
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,440
He promised Wilson it spread word of
the rape of Nanking back in Europe.

511
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,740
Then he boarded a plane
with Dora and he left.

512
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,190
Now is it for John?

513
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:46,680
Rob,

514
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,120
as soon as he touched down in Germany,

515
00:21:48,121 --> 00:21:50,550
he was arrested by the
Gestapo for annoying.

516
00:21:50,551 --> 00:21:51,600
They're Japanese allies.

517
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,890
It was in prison and it was only the
intervention of Siemens CEO that saved him

518
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,050
reassigned to a lonely character position.

519
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:01,290
Rob Spent the next few years
struggling just to make ends meet.

520
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,630
When World War Two ended in mid 1945,

521
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,460
his former standing within the Nazi party.

522
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:05,731
Sorry,

523
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:06,564
I'm arrested again.

524
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,030
This time by the allies put on trial.

525
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,500
Rob was only saved this time around by
testimony from Dr Wilson left to rot in

526
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:14,370
jail for a year.

527
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Rob was finally declared dean ossified
in 1946 and he was released with a stain

528
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,360
of Nazi membership clinging to his soul.

529
00:22:21,361 --> 00:22:25,530
The last years of John Rob's life saw
him become unemployable as the post war

530
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:29,250
German economic miracle or living
standards rise in the defeated nation,

531
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,550
John and slash or rob sank
into help this poverty.

532
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:36,000
The only thing that kept them going and
those harsh years were sent me regular

533
00:22:36,001 --> 00:22:39,630
food parcels covered in Chinese
writing that resound address.

534
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,190
It was always nagging.

535
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:42,091
Finally,

536
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,260
in January of Nineteen 50,

537
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:43,561
John,

538
00:22:43,561 --> 00:22:45,720
rob keeled over and died of a stroke.

539
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,330
It was 68 by the time he died.

540
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,811
Rob Was A.

541
00:22:48,811 --> 00:22:52,650
nobody a source of shame that came in
Germany had been written out of the

542
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,800
Chinese history of hanging by the
Julian stored communist party.

543
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,750
Those who'd been in Nanking,

544
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:58,643
they remembered him,

545
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,920
but the rest of the world they forgot

546
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,340
in the 19 nineties,

547
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:12,130
Iris Chang was researching
the Nanjing Massacre.

548
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:16,030
She uncovered rob's diaries alongside
stacks of documents relating to his

549
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:17,390
involvement in the safety side.

550
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:22,360
Piecing is incredible story together she
managed to return his name to the wells

551
00:23:22,361 --> 00:23:23,170
at large,

552
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,920
not long after the Chinese government
paid to have rob's gravestone taken from

553
00:23:26,921 --> 00:23:29,530
Berlin and reentered in Nanjing,

554
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,430
the modern city that John
and Dora had known as king.

555
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,930
It was placed at the site of a
gigantic memorial to the massacre.

556
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,250
After half a century,

557
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,510
rob had finally then returns to the
country which had fought for and Ted loved

558
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:44,344
so much.

559
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,891
Nowadays,

560
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:49,370
it is estimated that rob's actions in
nanking saved somewhere in the region of

561
00:23:49,371 --> 00:23:51,440
250,000 lives.

562
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,960
Nearly everyone who made it into the zone.

563
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:54,891
By contrast,

564
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:58,400
the far more famous Oscar
Schindler saved 1,200 people.

565
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,860
There is no doubt that
schindler was a hero,

566
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:01,933
but rob,

567
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,020
he was something more.

568
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:05,300
He was a savior as history is good.

569
00:24:05,301 --> 00:24:06,260
Nazi once wrote,

570
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,970
if you can do some good,

571
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,463
why hesitate.

572
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,480
