00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,980
You might never have heard of
German chemist Fritz harbor,

7
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:30,981
but there is a 50% chance that you
owe your very existence to this man's

8
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:32,820
invention.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,200
The process he designed to confess
atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia made it

10
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:40,020
possible to produce
fertilizers on a large scale,

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,110
ensuring much more plentiful harvests
than ever before in the history of mankind

12
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:48,180
and therefore saving billions
of people from starvation.

13
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,450
It is estimate is that the food base of
half the current world's population is

14
00:00:53,881 --> 00:00:58,170
based on his harbor Bosh process.
This achievement granted Dr Harbor,

15
00:00:58,171 --> 00:00:59,310
the highest of accolades,

16
00:00:59,311 --> 00:01:04,311
the Nobel prize for chemistry in 1918
and yet there is a dark side to this

17
00:01:05,461 --> 00:01:10,230
benefactor of humanity, a story of
family abuse, of suicide, of blinds,

18
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:14,730
loyalty taken to the extreme and it's
the first ever use of weapons of mass

19
00:01:14,731 --> 00:01:18,890
destruction on a battlefield.
This is the story of how Fritz Harbor,

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,100
the Jewish scientist,

21
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:25,050
unwittingly created the ultimate weapon
that brought about the Holocaust.

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,220
The story of Fritz Haber has been
described as worthy of a Greek tragic hero

23
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:39,180
free training from it's very first year
as all of the ingredients of a classic

24
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:39,960
tragedy,

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,580
father and son relationship conflicts
of the early shadow of death and Hubris.

26
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,890
And then of course there's the explosives.

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:51,510
Fritz Alba was born on December the
ninth 1868 in breast law pressure.

28
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,410
Now, Rod Slava in Poland, his
parents seek freedom. Paula,

29
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:59,160
we're both members of a wealthy Jewish
family established in the area since the

30
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:03,300
early 18 hundreds to be more precise.
They were members of the same family.

31
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:06,720
They were in fact first cousins who
would married against the will of their

32
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:11,430
relatives. His life had barely started
when it was already struck by tragedy.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,060
His mother died from complications.

34
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:16,260
They need three weeks off to trial
to bath his father. So he agreed.

35
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:19,740
He was devastated leaving Fritz in the
camera of relatives. As a consequence,

36
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:22,980
the two group cold and
distance and then relationship.

37
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:25,500
It never really recovered
when his son was six,

38
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,520
Siegfried remarried and
had three daughters, Elsie,
Helen and Frieda with him.

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:33,510
Fritz actually got along with well,
but the life of Fritz.

40
00:02:33,511 --> 00:02:38,511
It was to be shaped by his own ambitions
rather than the influence of his

41
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:39,300
family.

42
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:43,650
He had the ambition to Mazda Science from
an early age and the ambition to prove

43
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:48,651
that he was first a German and then a
Jew he was ready to serve is Kaiser and

44
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:50,790
his recently unified fatherland.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,420
After completing high school in 1886
fritz declines and offered to become an

46
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:56,880
apprentice at his father's dying company.
The two men,

47
00:02:56,881 --> 00:03:00,730
they frequently clashed and simply
could not work together. Instead,

48
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:02,770
Fritz applied to study
chemistry in Berlin.

49
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:07,360
I think his doctorate [inaudible] 1891
having achieved a doctorate in less than

50
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,270
five years was already impressive enough.
Moreover,

51
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:14,030
Fritz had to interrupt his studies for
one year of compulsory military service

52
00:03:14,031 --> 00:03:15,220
and an artillery regimens.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,260
This was to be his first experience with
the explosive power of modern warfare.

54
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,773
Hmm.

55
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,070
Siegfried Haba made another attempt to
to involve his son Fritz in the family

56
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:33,940
business, but their personalities, they
just weren't compatible. Fritz source.

57
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:34,391
Instead,

58
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,320
it's an outlet for his
ambition in academia starting
as an independent assistant

59
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:42,850
at the University of unit from 1892 to
[inaudible] 94 it was a unit that he

60
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,670
decided to convert from
Judaism to Lutheranism,

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,420
how belong to one of the first generations
of Jewish citizens to hit the labor

62
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,940
market after the unification of Germany.

63
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,450
He experienced a variety of options and
opportunities that were not available to

64
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,330
that predessessors and he had
young Jewish men like Fritz.

65
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:02,840
They still felt the need to convert in
order to progress in their careers and

66
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,420
prove that they were truly German Patriots
Arbors Korea. It indeed flourished.

67
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:11,230
In 1894 he moved to the University of
calls or up published two chemistry

68
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:15,880
treaties and escalated through the ranks
becoming professor at the age of just

69
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,714
38

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,330
it was at the University of calls row
between 1894 and 1911 that Fritz harbor

71
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,470
invented and developed what became
known as the Harbor Bosh process.

72
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,360
Let me explain this step by step.

73
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,080
They use of nitrogen based fertilizers
to increase production of agricultural

74
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:39,270
crops had already been in use for decades.

75
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,110
These fertilizers way expensive as they
relying on imports of sodium nitrate

76
00:04:43,111 --> 00:04:44,910
from South American countries,

77
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,420
mostly Chile and so where exactly
do you find sodium nitrates?

78
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:53,400
Well that would be in Guano or
in other words, bird crap. Yup,

79
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,000
that's right.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The economy of entire countries
depended on bird crap and yes,

81
00:04:59,011 --> 00:05:01,920
wars were fought over it and yet nitrogen,
well,

82
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,010
nitrogen is one of the most common
elements in the atmosphere. Indeed,

83
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:09,360
it makes up 80% of the air we breathe.
The genius of harbors invention,

84
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,980
Wistia fixate nitrogen to hydrogen
under extreme conditions of pressure.

85
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,080
This resulted in ammonia,

86
00:05:16,081 --> 00:05:19,680
which would then become the
main ingredients for cheap
and efficient fertilizers,

87
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:23,380
which we still use today.
The consequences of this invention,

88
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,910
they've changed the world as we know it.
Before the Harbor Bosch Process,

89
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,740
the world's population had plateaued,

90
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:32,520
is about a billion people and this was
due to the inability to produce enough

91
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:36,240
food for everybody, but
the new fertilizers they
were going to change that.

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,620
Fritz all of his process,

93
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:41,220
the growth and sustainability
of the world's population
is such that it has been

94
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:44,820
estimated that the food base of about
half the world's current population

95
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,510
derives from the Harbor Bosh process.
This invention,

96
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,530
it was hailed as a miracle and it was
described by his contemporaries as brought

97
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,590
or stir loft or bread from the APP.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,633
Okay.

99
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,950
Three years went by and harbors endeavors.

100
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:08,230
They were about to change as Germany and
the whole of Europe rush towards war in

101
00:06:08,231 --> 00:06:12,070
the autumn of 1914 harbor enthusiastically
volunteered to put his signs in the

102
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:16,360
service of the Ministry of war and he had
the right experience at the right time.

103
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:19,840
Often Germany had invaded Belgium in
August causing the British Empire to

104
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:20,674
declare war.

105
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,790
The Royal Navy had launched a blockade
on gem and Portstewart slowly choke the

106
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:28,110
Kaisers war industry explosives,
just like fertilizers.

107
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,150
They relied on heavy quantities
of nitrogen to be produced,

108
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:34,900
which of course at that time still
required massive amounts of bird crap from

109
00:06:34,901 --> 00:06:37,990
Chile, but with the British
blockade, the explosive factories,

110
00:06:37,991 --> 00:06:41,200
they soon ran out of supplies as
a result of the gem in itinerary.

111
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:45,260
Could have been left without ammunition
off to 86 months of war. This,

112
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,400
this is where Fritz Hover and
enters the picture during peacetime,

113
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,830
he said a scientist to
belongs to the world,

114
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:53,680
but during wartime he
belongs to his country.

115
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,910
His first achievement was to adapt to
the Hama Bosch process to the production

116
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:01,210
of explosives, many of which
and nitrogen based compounds.

117
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,860
It's fascinating how this elements can be
used to both raise crops and also cool.

118
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:09,190
It's such destruction,
but Fritz Saba now left tenant Taba.

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,660
He had higher ambitions.

120
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,780
He gets approved again that he was a
true gentleman and a tree patriots.

121
00:07:13,781 --> 00:07:16,240
He approached the high
commands with a new proposal.

122
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,960
This proposal was the weaponization
of chemicals to break the stalemate of

123
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:22,210
trench warfare on the western front.

124
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,300
Thursday the 22nd of April,

125
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:34,040
1915 British and Canadian troops
are entrenched in that position,

126
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:38,850
is facing the German lines on the heat
press salient in western Belgium all

127
00:07:38,851 --> 00:07:39,684
appears quiet.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,720
The allied observers for most of the day
until that is exactly 5:00 PM a gentle

129
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,580
Westwood breeze.
Dawn's blooming in that direction,

130
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,520
but today's wind is
carrying a strange missed,

131
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:54,180
which seems to build up and
thicken yod off the yard.

132
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,710
Some soldiers notice how birds caught
in the cloud and Midaz simply stop

133
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:02,640
flapping their wings and drop like
stones to the ground. The clouds.

134
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,670
Now a rolling toxic wall of intangible
death causes even the leaves and they ads

135
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:11,760
of grass to shrivel and die.
On This Day, the 22nd of April,

136
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:16,710
1915 at 5:00 PM the gentleman imperial
army launched a surprise attack against

137
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:17,670
the allied trenches,

138
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,880
the secret weapon 5,700 cylinders
containing 150 tons of chlorine gas.

139
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,540
The mastermind behind the
attack left tenant, Fritz Haba.

140
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,350
He had come to the front stoop personally
supervise the opening of the valves

141
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:34,740
that would unleash the first successful
use of a weapon of mass destruction on

142
00:08:34,741 --> 00:08:38,310
the battlefields and British soldier left
and accounts of what happens when the

143
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,610
cloud of Corrine reached the
allied positions. It reads,

144
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:44,640
the living wall of green fog
about four feet in height,

145
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:48,930
moved towards the French line and spread
out to a width of about 180 meters.

146
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,200
As the wall of smoke grew higher,
the whole area disappeared into it.

147
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,420
Suddenly the rifle far from the
French but gradually die down.

148
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,480
Soon. We have strange shouts
coming from the green fog.

149
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,450
The cries became weaker
as morning coherence.

150
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,010
Then masses of soldiers tumbled upon
us from out of the fog ans collapsed.

151
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:12,090
Most weren't wounded to. They had
expressions of terror on their faces.

152
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,300
The effects of chlorine gas on
the body that just plain nasty.

153
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,850
The gas cools is acute
inflammation of the eyes, nose,

154
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:21,600
throat and lungs to which
the body's immune system
reacts with an overproduction

155
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:26,040
of Mucus seemingly always cog off and
you don't have to gasping for breath.

156
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,180
That wouldn't have a com.

157
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:32,160
It's like drowning on dry lands was Fritz
Saba and any way concerned about the

158
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:35,730
ethics of chemical warfare, but
apparently not as he was quoted as saying,

159
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,120
death is death no matter
how it is inflicted.

160
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,720
Although the battle ended in a stalemate.

161
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,240
Typical of the Western Front
hobbits contribution ends,

162
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,600
initial gas attack was
considered a complete success
and he was rewarded with a

163
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:51,900
promotion to captain and some
days of leave away from the front,

164
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:56,190
but it was he away from the pain and the
misery and the death. We're not ready,

165
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,900
but before I get into hobbies life,

166
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:00,480

recommendation from me on that platform,

176
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,150
I would recommend the history of food,

177
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:33,960
which talks a lot about the revolution
of agriculture and some about what we

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,650
And let's get back to it

190
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,431
now.
This point,

191
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:25,020
we do need to stop for a moment and
rewinds and take a closer look at another

192
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:29,430
character in our story who
is often overlooked in life
and when almost forgotten

193
00:11:29,431 --> 00:11:32,340
in death.
She is Fritz's wife cholera.

194
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,240
Cholera is life mirrored in many ways.
The life of the husbands.

195
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,250
She too was born into a Jewish family
from breast law and 1870 from parents who

196
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,710
were first cousins and
it's just like Fred Street,

197
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:47,640
then converted to Christianity at
the age of 27 but most significantly.

198
00:11:47,641 --> 00:11:50,280
Clara was also a chemist
and a brilliant one at that.

199
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,730
Overcoming societal pressures and the
unfairness of a patriarchal society that

200
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,440
disapproved of women scientists,

201
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,160
Clara and enrolled in the breast law
university earning a doctorate Suma cum

202
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:05,080
laude in 1900 she became the first
German woman to be awarded a phd in

203
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:06,790
chemistry,
Flora and Fritz.

204
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:10,960
They met with the first time in 1898 it
dancing lesson and they fell in love and

205
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,090
then for proposed to
her shortly thereafter,

206
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,940
but unusually for that
time Clara had declines.

207
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,140
The offer is she first wanted to
establish her own financial and personal

208
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:23,950
independence. Fritz did not give
up and z continued as courtship,

209
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,710
which culminated in their marriage
in 1901 their only son, Herman.

210
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,150
He was born the following year according
to one of harbors, biographers,

211
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,750
Diedrich Stoltz and bag.
That union was a happy and successful one.

212
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,200
Fritz was deeply in love with Clarins.
Okay.

213
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,810
Every occasion to dote on her
as well as their child's not.

214
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:43,900
Everybody agreed with that.
Clara herself confided to her friends.

215
00:12:43,901 --> 00:12:47,800
This a life group more miserable.
There's time went on as she put it.

216
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,520
The main reason for that was Fritz is
oppressive way of putting himself first in

217
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:55,780
our home and marriage so that are less
ruthlessly self assertive personality was

218
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:59,260
simply destroyed their marriage.
It's soon was in crisis.

219
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,370
Pardo was seldom at home and made his
disdain for his scientific endeavors quite

220
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,060
clear.

221
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,300
He runs on frequent trips with colleagues
and even had affairs with other women

222
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,750
and a letter to her old
mensa professor abig.

223
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:15,340
Clara had even complains that Fritz is
games and scientific successes had been

224
00:13:15,341 --> 00:13:16,060
her loss.

225
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:20,230
The fact is that Clara Mfr was not suited
to the traditional subservient role

226
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:24,220
assigned to housewives. In the early
20th century. She was a feminist,

227
00:13:24,221 --> 00:13:28,120
firmly believing that a woman's intellect
was by no means in Feria to a man

228
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,900
sinned. Yet even though she actively
contributed to her husband's research on

229
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:35,500
fertilizers or work at when's uncredited.
In later years,

230
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:39,310
she was confined to translating into
English. Fritz is scientific papers.

231
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,720
Clara was also a staunch pacifist
and since denounced from the outset,

232
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:47,350
the madness of the Great Wall when Fritz
started contributing to the war effort

233
00:13:47,351 --> 00:13:50,530
by using his harbor Bosch
process to produce explosives,

234
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:52,360
she was appalled and open late.

235
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,370
The post is worked announcing it as a
perversion of the ideals of science and a

236
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,370
sign of barbarity corrupting
the very disciplined,

237
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,860
which ought to bring
new insights into life.

238
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,580
Then when our husband enthusiastically
dedicated himself to the application of

239
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:07,840
chemical warfare,
well,

240
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:13,060
this was the final straw to the fragile
balance of their marriage and do our own

241
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:16,850
psyche. According to Stolsenberg, she
had a family history of depression.

242
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,150
Kara herself may have
suffered from it too.

243
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,930
So she desperately pleaded with Fritz
to cease working with the military,

244
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,360
but instead of dealing
with our views and private,

245
00:14:25,361 --> 00:14:29,770
his angry reaction was to denounce her
in public of making statements that were

246
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,210
treasonists to the fatherland.

247
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,751
All right,

248
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:40,780
so now let's get back to those fateful
days after the battle of eep prep.

249
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,760
Captain Fritz Hall that
is being celebrated by the
German Imperial Army High

250
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:48,280
Commands for his success with chlorine
and he's now a bounce and leave for

251
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:50,500
another mission on the eastern front.
This mission,

252
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,070
well it was the Russians turn to drown
on try then maybe you can tell what

253
00:14:55,071 --> 00:14:59,900
happened exactly on May the second 1915
but we know at least some of the facts,

254
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,180
flora and Fritz have another argument
since they had been sparked by the role

255
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:06,740
that he played in eat Bruh or the news
that he was going to repeat his exploits

256
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,290
against the Russians.
That nice while he is sleeping,

257
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,140
Clara walks into their garden
carrying Fritz is service side.

258
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:13,970
Sidearm a Luger nine millimeter.

259
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,010
A single shot rings out Herman
Khara and Fritz is only child age.

260
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,720
Teen runs into the garden to find his
mother slowly dying from a self inflicted

261
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:27,680
pistol. Shot to the chest,
Clara dies and I'm in zombies.

262
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,550
And what did Captain Haba
do? Well, he just left.

263
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,820
He was due on the eastern front to
release more gas on Germany's enemies.

264
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:38,370
And so he left the very next morning
leaving common to grieve alone.

265
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,750
Clarissa named [inaudible]
in German means always true.

266
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,710
Perhaps it was her desire to stay always
true to how the leafs that led to her

267
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,410
taking in life as,
but Fritz,

268
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,350
why did he leave his son alone
in that terrible moments?

269
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,860
Was it his sense of extreme duty
and loyalty to the Fatherland?

270
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:59,150
Was it unwillingness to cope with the
responsibility of his wife suicide or

271
00:15:59,151 --> 00:16:01,130
we'll never really know
for the rest of his life.

272
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,530
Harbor never discussed any of the details
of car his death on May the eighth

273
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:07,220
alone arbitrary in a newspaper,

274
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,960
report it on the suicide of the wife
of Dr h if the secret service who is

275
00:16:11,961 --> 00:16:15,890
currently at the front adding that.
The reasons for the unhappy women's act.

276
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:20,330
I don't know how that remarried to as
data with Charlotte Nathan and had two

277
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:21,950
children.
Eva lutes,

278
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,940
Parlez first son never approved of
this union and the degree of feathering

279
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:29,210
feather apart from his father
and Disney family I'm in,

280
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,560
did not have a happy life.

281
00:16:30,561 --> 00:16:35,120
He moved to the USA shortly before the
Algebraic of World War Two and in 1946 he

282
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:36,410
too committed suicide.

283
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,980
Is that in daughter Claire was a
chemist employed by the u s government's

284
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:41,990
research and antidote for chlorine gas.

285
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:46,250
When our research project was shut down
in favor of work on the atomic bomb,

286
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:51,410
she too for a third time in three
consecutive generations committed suicide.

287
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:02,080
Germany's defeat in November of 1918 was
a devastating blow for Captain Harbor

288
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:04,180
who is now professor Haba once again,

289
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,630
that yet however brought him a
much needed piece of good news.

290
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:12,280
His invention of the hub of Bosch
process was selected by the Royal Swedish

291
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,950
Academy of Sciences is winner for that.
He has Nobel prize in Chemistry.

292
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,720
The official motivation being for the
synthesis of ammonia from its elements.

293
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,830
Now it had been common for scientists
have both sides during the war to serve

294
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:27,570
and their respective countries, chemical
warfare units, future Nobel laureates,

295
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,840
James Franco stuff hubs to auto hunt,
served as gas strips and hobbyists units,

296
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,830
but probably the winds from the great
war that was still too fresh and Harb.

297
00:17:35,831 --> 00:17:39,610
His prize was received as an
outrage by the scientific community,

298
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,700
especially in the u s and the UK
where he was considered a war.

299
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:44,370
Criminal Professor Ernst Rutherford,

300
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,900
father of nuclear physics
famously refused to shake.

301
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:51,510
Fritz Havas handed a conference in
Cambridge in 1919 despite international

302
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:54,720
isolation, Fritz Harbor, he
managed to keep himself busy first.

303
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:58,640
In 1919 he was appointed director of the
newly founded [inaudible] company and I

304
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,401
remember that name,

305
00:17:59,401 --> 00:18:03,480
that it's a chemical
manufacturer specializing in
fertilizers and pesticides and

306
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,130
then came his next big project.

307
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:09,630
The same way he had managed to make bread
from Haba now devoted himself to turn

308
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,390
water into gold or to be more correct.

309
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,400
Do you want to do extract
gold from sea water?

310
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,020
This was his attempt to do support.

311
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:20,130
The recently established Weimar
republic by paying back Germany's war

312
00:18:20,131 --> 00:18:22,860
reparations to the allied powers.
Unfortunately,

313
00:18:22,861 --> 00:18:27,030
the concentration of golden seawater
turned out to be two skus and the process

314
00:18:27,031 --> 00:18:29,130
to extract it was too costly.

315
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:34,643
Yeah.

316
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,350
Does life all his efforts to serve his
country as best he could to the German

317
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:41,020
people would soon prove
to be an ungrateful one.

318
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Let's not forget that dark
forces where it works.

319
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:48,520
During the 1920s and early 1930s as
soon as the Nazis were voted into power,

320
00:18:48,521 --> 00:18:50,950
a new law was ratified in April,

321
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,520
1933 which prevented Jews from holding
positions in the civil service.

322
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,810
For other than time,

323
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,770
he held the role of presidents of the
Kaysville Home Institute for physics and

324
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,040
Electric Chemistry. A smear
campaign was launched, you Al Stim,

325
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,410
although he is a convert
and to form a world war,

326
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:10,240
one decorated veteran was legally entitled
to keep us post. This did not apply.

327
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:13,660
However, to his collaborators, three
quarters of which we're still Jews,

328
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:16,730
and so he was simply audit to
fire them. In this case, hover,

329
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,350
applying a form of silent
resistance to Nazi prevarications,

330
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,710
delayed their dismissal until he could
find employment for each one of them,

331
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,900
but at Harvard had realized
that it was time to go.

332
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:29,980
Between the summer of 1933 and
30 1934 frets, his former wife,

333
00:19:29,981 --> 00:19:34,330
Charlotte and all of his children from
both marriages all fled abroad and

334
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:38,140
settled in the UK. Habo is now
suffering from cardiovascular disease,

335
00:19:38,141 --> 00:19:42,040
but when he was offered a directorship
at a research institute in British

336
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,040
Palestine, he eagerly accepted
halfway through his journey in Basel,

337
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:49,150
Switzerland for Tava succumb to a
fatal episode of acute heart failure.

338
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,740
It was the 29th of January,

339
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,730
1934 he was buried in the local cemetery
where his ashes were joined by as

340
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,160
remains three years later.

341
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,213
Yeah.

342
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,600
Now, it is uncommon for us to continue
our stories after the death of a main

343
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,171
character,

344
00:20:08,171 --> 00:20:12,370
but what happened some years after
Fritz harbors demise is suddenly worth

345
00:20:12,371 --> 00:20:16,490
telling. If you remember
back in 1919 Hubbard had been
one of the founders of the

346
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:20,110
[inaudible] Gash chemical company
dedicated to fertilizers and pesticides.

347
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,980
One of their top selling products to
which are the had personally contributed

348
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:29,010
was in fact a very powerful pesticide
for agricultural use and improvements on

349
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:32,590
the existing hydrogen
cyanide or prosec acid.

350
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:37,000
It was enriched with absorbance and an
Irish tends to act as a warning against

351
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:37,600
leaks.

352
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,600
It was used mainly for delousing purposes
until August of 1941 and ss cabs in

353
00:20:43,481 --> 00:20:47,930
call each used it as a gassing
agent to kill some Russian pdws.

354
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,060
This came to the attention of Rudolph
[inaudible] of a Nazi officials.

355
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,570
They were looking for a solution to
solve what they considered the ultimate

356
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:58,780
problem. You would say that they
were looking for a final solution,

357
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,350
a cheap and efficient way to
exterminate millions of Jews,

358
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,540
Roemer and other undesirables.

359
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,450
The pesticide was modified
to remove its warning odor,

360
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:11,230
and it's I irritants so as to take
the victim's completely by surprise.

361
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,400
The original name of the chemical, well,
that was Zyklon. It's modified version.

362
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,900
The infamous is like plan B,

363
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:20,200
the preferred killing tool
used by the Nazi delirium too,

364
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,730
and the lives of millions of innocent
Jews and other prisoners in the gas

365
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:26,110
chambers of Auschwitz.

366
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:30,370
Malveaux sin and to book involved among
the countless dad with some of Fritz

367
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:35,350
harvest relatives. This was
the last defining act of
the tragedy of Fritz Haber,

368
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,760
a Jew who renounced his faith to prove
he was a worthy German and demand torn

369
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:41,290
apart by his ambition,

370
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,030
his devotion to the fatherland and his
inability to love those who were closest

371
00:21:46,031 --> 00:21:46,864
to him.

372
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,900
Well, this is where we end.
Today's biographics. I hope
you enjoyed this episode.

373
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:57,610
Despite it's rather dark themes.

374

We love to hear about your
views on Fritz harbor,

375
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,210
should we remember him
as a genius scientist who
prevented countless famines and

376
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:09,280
truly deserving of a Nobel prize or as
a callus monster who contributed to the

377
00:22:09,281 --> 00:22:14,110
disintegration of a heroine and to
the horrors of modern warfare? Well,

and why not check it off
video about Timothy Mcveigh,

389

and then you can see the tenuous link
between that American terrorist and our

390
00:22:46,121 --> 00:22:47,620
protagonist of today.
