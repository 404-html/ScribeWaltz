1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,410
Been.

2
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,140
Hillary was the stereotypical country
bumpkin hailing from rural New Zealand.

3
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:04,591
The shy,

4
00:00:04,591 --> 00:00:08,370
gangly beekeeper steps out of the
shadows to take on one of the greatest

5
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:10,200
physical challenges of them all.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,990
Climbing the world's highest
mountain through guts,

7
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,380
script,

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,250
and determination.

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,113
He managed to,

10
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,320
as he famously says,

11
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,790
knock the bast it off.

12
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:18,420
From there,

13
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,810
he used his newfound fame as a platform
to improve the lives of the Nepalese

14
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:26,010
people who had developed an affinity for
leaving behind the legacy of it endures

15
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,270
beyond the record books.

16
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,410
In today's buying graphics,

17
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:31,070
we look at the life and the
accomplishments of the first demands.

18
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:32,400
Who ever climbed Mount Everest,

19
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,870
Sir Edmund Hillary.

20
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,861
It means first of all,

21
00:00:43,861 --> 00:00:47,710
we're going to read was born on July
the 20th 1919 in Aucklands and New

22
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,120
Zealand's shortly after
the birth of his father,

23
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:52,900
Percival or Augustus was allocated a
land grants in recognition of his service

24
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:54,700
during the first world war as a results,

25
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,121
the family,

26
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,590
which included three year olds in June,

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,890
moved itself to the finding
sediments of two cow or younger.

28
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:00,250
Brother.

29
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,720
Rex soon came along June.

30
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:03,550
Later described the three boys as follows,

31
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,840
as had the brains,

32
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,010
racks have the looks,

33
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,580
and I was the girl according
to ads own recollections.

34
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,770
It was his mother who
held the family together.

35
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:14,620
She managed the money that's made
sure that the kids were okay.

36
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,910
This was no easy task.

37
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,870
Hillary children has an adventurous
streak that saw them pushing everything to

38
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:20,470
the limits.

39
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,830
One seven racks swap to bicycles with
edge riding on the one that was too small

40
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:24,280
for him.

41
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,581
Rex,

42
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,030
however,

43
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,640
founded hard to control the
larger bike still living.

44
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:28,750
The tag would be chasing him.

45
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:31,240
He went as fast as he
could turning your corner.

46
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,050
He collided with a car bouncing off the
bonus and then bouncing off the road.

47
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,240
The driver was terrified
that he had killed racks,

48
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,810
but ed was merely terrified of the
beating he knew his father would give him

49
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,460
when he saw the state of the bike.

50
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,470
Although Percy was a pacifist,

51
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,660
he was prone to fits of rage.

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,010
These bursts of rage.

53
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,200
Think we usually directed
at his oldest son,

54
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,970
even though he feared the beatings,

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,810
the southern edge was determined to
never give his father the satisfaction of

56
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:59,650
admitting that he had done anything wrong
despite the competitive bond with his

57
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:00,120
brother.

58
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,521
Ed's other,

59
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,060
yes,

60
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,460
they were filled with loneliness
throughout this primary years.

61
00:02:03,461 --> 00:02:05,980
He didn't make any friends while
other kids were out playing.

62
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,930
He fills his time with extra tuition,

63
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,110
which allows him to enter high
school two years ahead of his peers.

64
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,680
This only made his social situation worst,

65
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:17,350
though he was now shorter and the younger
than all the other kids high school

66
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:17,600
men's,

67
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,190
that he had to take the train
to the prestigious Auckland
Grammar school and rub

68
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:22,780
shoulders with the
children of the wealthy.

69
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,040
This intensified his lack of self
confidence and social awkwardness.

70
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:31,420
Even further in his later years often
recounts an incidents that occurred during

71
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:32,101
his first week.

72
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:34,930
You could Auckland's grammar
that had a deep impact on him.

73
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,050
He turns up for his first gym
class along with his classmates.

74
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,130
The teacher surveyed his new students
and then fixing his gaze on Ed said,

75
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,630
what have they sent me?

76
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:44,350
He then went zones,

77
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,881
the catalog,

78
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:47,170
a long list of what he
saw was wrong with that.

79
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:47,980
Finally,

80
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,610
he told the humiliated boy to go
against the wall with the other misfits.

81
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,000
Ed Recalls that this incident is marked
the beginning of a sense of inferiority

82
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,834
about his looks,

83
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,300
which would remain with him
for the rest of his life.

84
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,440
Ed founds the companionship that he
lacks with other humans in books.

85
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,880
After waiting through the typical teenage
and literary attractions of the days

86
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:08,620
such as Edgar Rice
Burroughs and h a Haggis,

87
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,810
he discovered books on
mounds and narrowing.

88
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,710
They fascinated him and he
devoured everything on the
subject that he could get

89
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:18,490
his hands on personally around the
local newspaper in the town and had a

90
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:22,550
sideline business as a beekeeper in 1935
and in last year at Oakland Grammar,

91
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:25,600
the family moved to the inner
Oakland suburb of rem or era.

92
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,240
Beekeeping now became the
family's main source of income.

93
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,990
The changements that adds no longer had
to spend hours on the train every single

94
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:32,824
day

95
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,210
from college,

96
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:40,180
Edwin's homes of the University of
Auckland where he studied mathematics and

97
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,014
science.

98
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,150
He also joins the university tramping
club with his long stride and is abundance

99
00:03:45,151 --> 00:03:45,551
stamina.

100
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:47,410
He seemed became a star Bush Walker.

101
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,370
He also took lessons in boxing and
Jujitsu that head to head combat.

102
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,880
It wasn't his style in 1938 as who had
been struggling academically drops out of

103
00:03:55,881 --> 00:03:58,570
the university and joined his
father in the beekeeping business.

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,380
His Stamina,

105
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,951
endurance,

106
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:02,170
and physical strength were
ideally suited for the job.

107
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,980
It was hot,

108
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,120
physically demanding work,

109
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:08,080
and in the summer he would carry out his
duties wearing only shorts or a hat and

110
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:12,550
a veil every day it would have
to India up to 300 bee stings.

111
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,710
Not long after ed began
working on the beef farm,

112
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,720
his parents converted to a new age,

113
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,940
religious movements called radiant living.

114
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,760
The group had beliefs that we're not
far removed from those of Christian

115
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,470
scientists at and his brother,

116
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:23,891
rex,

117
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:28,410
they soon became converts to when war
broke out in 1939 it appears inevitable

118
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,110
that both Hillary boys would be drafted
into the New Zealand armed services,

119
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:32,970
but proceed.

120
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,620
The pacifist was determined to
prevent this from happening.

121
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,280
He managed to get himself off the hook
by relying on a provision that allowed

122
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:42,670
exemptions for reserved
occupations including beekeeping.

123
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,191
However,

124
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:43,581
that person,

125
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,840
he did all of this without telling Ed
who was not happy to hear about his

126
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:49,840
father's meddling personally soon
discovered there's only one exemption per

127
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:51,900
family was allowed as exemption men,

128
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,530
so the corrects would have to go to war.

129
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,060
It just so happens though that racks,

130
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,880
unlike Ed,

131
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,150
was a conscientious objector ad would
have been happy to sign up or there's

132
00:04:59,151 --> 00:04:59,984
wrecks wasn't.

133
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,150
He followed his conscious and spent the
next four years in a detention camp for

134
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:07,570
three years and fumes silently that his
father had prevented him from fulfilling

135
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,730
what he saw as his patriotic duty.

136
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,241
Finally,

137
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:13,090
in 1944 he joins the Royal
New Zealand Air Force.

138
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,790
It was during his training as a
flight navigator in New Zealand,

139
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,640
South Islands that had
encountered towering mountains.

140
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,470
He managed to get in a few solo climbs.

141
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,580
Then he came across the 2,884 meters,

142
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,580
snu camps and mounts,

143
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,423
Tapper Werner crew.

144
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,380
He became determined to make an a sense
and arranged for a three day leave.

145
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,630
He arranged do plan the
mountain with a partner,

146
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,750
but the man pulled out at the last
minute and decided to go at alone with a

147
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,880
friend taking him part of
the way on his motorbike.

148
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:40,210
He then walked eight kilometers to
a farm where he stayed overnight.

149
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,370
The next day he walked
another 24 kilometers.

150
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,520
Overnight it there's another farm
and then set off the mountain.

151
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,400
He reached the top without any
trouble anti returned safely.

152
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,870
The next day he walked
another 32 kilometers before
receiving a left and it was

153
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,610
delighted with this first experience.

154
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,070
He had knocked off his
first mountain and it felt

155
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,100
returning to his war service had found
himself a stations to the Pacific

156
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:05,670
islands.

157
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,181
Years later,

158
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:09,810
he would recall coming across this small
Fijian boy who came up and begged for a

159
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:13,560
piece of bread experiences like
this form the catalyst for his great

160
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:16,980
humanitarian work that he
would pursue later in life ads.

161
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,800
He never came there combat
though he did contract malaria.

162
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,940
His war also nearly ended in disaster
when a full petrol tank in his plane fell

163
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:25,140
and burst into flames.

164
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,860
The plane came down into the ocean before
ads who was not wearing a shirt could

165
00:06:28,861 --> 00:06:30,960
jump Claire of the
Blazer and craft a wave,

166
00:06:30,961 --> 00:06:33,180
knocked him off his feet
and he fell into the flames.

167
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,640
He then managed to roll off
the plane and into the sea.

168
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:39,090
Ed suffered secondary bands and the pain
was made worse by going having to swim

169
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:43,770
450 meters and then walk 800 meters
under the blazing sun before he reached

170
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,250
help,

171
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,970
he was taken to a hospital in Guadalcanal
where he was shot full of morphine and

172
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:48,810
antibiotics.

173
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,230
He was told that he would be in bed for
months before he could achieve a full

174
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,064
recovery.

175
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,550
However,

176
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:56,190
within two weeks he was
up and walking about.

177
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:00,030
He became so restless and so board that
he begged his doctors to allow him to

178
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:01,380
recover at home in Oakland.

179
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,250
They finally relented and
he was discharged from the
air force and sent home.

180
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:06,270
When I got home.

181
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,090
He didn't intend to buy
rounds but rather gets work,

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,090
but when he discovered that his father
had taken on other workers and to no

183
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:13,380
opening for him on the beef farm,

184
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,560
he moved to the South Islands
in search of new opportunities.

185
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,520
He joins the New Zealand Alpine club and
over the next couple of years he learns

186
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,980
their climate is craft as he took
on many of the mountain there,

187
00:07:22,981 --> 00:07:27,210
speaks of the South Island and its claims
with others but always wanted to be

188
00:07:27,211 --> 00:07:28,410
the first to the top.

189
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:32,670
In 1949 oldest sister June got married
personally had enjoyed and especially

190
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:36,710
good honey season and he paid for ed to
travel with his parents to Europe edge.

191
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,720
Took every opportunity to take on
European peaks including the Aiga Molly

192
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,920
was in Europe.

193
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,610
I had received a letter from a former
climbing partner by the name of George

194
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,620
Lowe informing him that
plans were underway.

195
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,120
Of a New Zealand party.

196
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,310
If you undertake a track of the Himalayas,

197
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,570
they intended to explore the possibility
of tackling the world's highest peak

198
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,503
Mount Everest,

199
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,740
something that had never been
done successfully before low.

200
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,690
He wants you to know whether
Hillary was interested.

201
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,100
The answer as well as you might imagine,

202
00:08:08,101 --> 00:08:10,890
it was an unequivocal yes
and mountaineering terms.

203
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:13,290
There was no greater
challenge than a successful,

204
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,610
a sense of Mount Everest,

205
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:18,360
which Tau is 8,848 meters from the ground.

206
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:21,480
Many climbers had died trying to get
their most famous famously the British

207
00:08:21,481 --> 00:08:21,850
climber,

208
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:26,190
George Mallory and 1924 but turning point
in the history of attempts on Everest

209
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:30,320
occurred in 1950 when the
Nepalese government agreed
to allow parties to attempt

210
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,790
the mountain from Nepal
on the southern side.

211
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,270
Previous expeditions at attacks from Tibet
on the northern side of the mountain,

212
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,530
the Nepalese government decided to let
a different country every year half ago.

213
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,260
It just so happens that in
addition to the New Zealand group,

214
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:44,550
a party of British climbers,

215
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,710
we're also planning
and assault on Everest.

216
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:48,910
The British group sent a
letter to the New Zealand,

217
00:08:48,911 --> 00:08:51,030
does suggesting that they
join up the invitation.

218
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,510
However,

219
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,680
it was only for two clients.

220
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,300
The question was now,

221
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,090
well you go after some heated discussion.

222
00:08:57,091 --> 00:08:58,290
It was decided that edge,

223
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,880
the acknowledged superior Kleiner and
I'll read a third would be the token New

224
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,390
Zealanders on the British
expedition rather than a
concerted effort to reach the

225
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:06,840
summit.

226
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,250
This expedition was more of an exploratory
probe while climbing with shifts in

227
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:15,090
the expedition leader and every came
across a vast hidden valley that appeared

228
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:17,700
to provide a previously
unknown route to the top.

229
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,400
The group split up and agreed
to return the next year.

230
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,440
The following year in 1952 however,

231
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,300
was assigned to a Swiss expedition.

232
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,680
Attempts to climb Everest,

233
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,300
the British within New Zealand
contingents that have to wait until 1953

234
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:34,771
burning.

235
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:37,500
The 1953 assaults began in
a small office in London.

236
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,370
It was led by Eric Shipton who believed
that the journey should be made by a

237
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:45,720
small team with basic supplies but shipped
and has only just begun choosing his

238
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:48,240
team when there was a
sudden change of plan.

239
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:51,900
Previous attempts to climb Everest by
small teams had failed and it was decided

240
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:56,040
that this time they would use a big team
with the latest equipment and plenty of

241
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,450
suppliers and new leader.

242
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:02,510
John Harms was appointed in March of 1953
the expedition team began to arrive in

243
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,354
Katmandu.

244
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:07,080
The team got ready to make their way
east to the Himalayas and Mount Everest.

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,460
Hillary was one of 14 climbers and more
than 30 Nepalese shoppers who made up

246
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:12,240
the team.

247
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Nearly 400 people set off from Katmandu
on March the 10th more than 350 of them

248
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:21,450
were locals who are hired
to carry supplies to the
site for the first camp for

249
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:22,284
17 days.

250
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,500
They walked through the Nepalese
countryside until they arrived base camp.

251
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,440
Then they stayed for three weeks
planning for clients to come.

252
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,800
They practiced with their climbing gear
on local cliffs and tried to get used to

253
00:10:31,801 --> 00:10:35,490
the thin air if the high mountains in
early April base camp was moved from near

254
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,860
Tengboche monastery to a second main base.

255
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:40,470
The lake camp hire up
by a lake on a glacier.

256
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,160
The first big challenge for the
leaders came on April the 13th for men,

257
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:44,991
including Hillary,

258
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:48,450
were selected by Hans to explore a
region known as the Khumbu icefall.

259
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,950
This was an area of how sized blocks
of ice that cracked and creaked.

260
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,980
The claim has had to find a safe route
for the Nepalese Sherpas who were to

261
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:59,910
follow bringing suppliers a number of
camps that were set up through the icefall

262
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,570
that leads climbers press through the
Khumbu icefall and set up advanced base

263
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,404
camp above it.

264
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,160
But I now Hillary had impressed all with
his boundless energy and exceptional

265
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:08,790
strength.

266
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,110
Early on in the morning of April,

267
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:13,980
the 26 ads have teamed up with Sherpa
Tenzing Norgay for the first time.

268
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,020
That task was to reach an advanced camp.

269
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:19,080
It was set up during the previous
year's Swiss expedition ropes.

270
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,470
Together.

271
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,730
The two men waded through deep,

272
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:24,630
slushy snow that had a shortened with
the sun's rays despite being hot and

273
00:11:24,631 --> 00:11:25,230
thirsty.

274
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,520
The Path worked well together.

275
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,491
Arriving at the camp,

276
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:29,190
they founds an unexpected treat.

277
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,170
The Swiss had left behind some supplies,

278
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,020
which included delicious gs
all the way back to base camp.

279
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,770
Hilary boasted to Norgay that he could
make it back within an hour all when's

280
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:40,380
well until he decided to
leap across a crevasse.

281
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,580
He reached the other side,

282
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,200
but the edge of the crevasse broke off.

283
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:47,340
Suddenly he was slipping downwards and
his fate was in the hands of his partner.

284
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:48,091
Fortunately,

285
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:49,440
Norgay was a brilliant climber.

286
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,410
He quickly grabbed a hold of the
pole and he used all of his skill,

287
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,530
strength and experience to help Hillary
climb up to the side of the crevasse

288
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,670
resenting to base camp.

289
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,390
The bonds between the two men had been
strengthened by Hilary's narrow escape

290
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:05,260
and then reread to his parents that he
had Norgay had become the Tigers of the

291
00:12:05,261 --> 00:12:05,801
campaign.

292
00:12:05,801 --> 00:12:06,634
On that day.

293
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,690
They had shown strength,

294
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,171
courage,

295
00:12:08,171 --> 00:12:09,004
and fearlessness,

296
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,460
and they hoped that that would
take them to the top of Everest.

297
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,171
By late May,

298
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:16,690
delete climbers had scaled the lots they
face to the south called the flat area.

299
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,760
That is one of the
nastiest places on Everest.

300
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,830
Yet they start out with the seventh camp.

301
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,640
This was where they would make their
final push to the summit to other climbers

302
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:26,080
were selected to make first push,

303
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,960
but they only made it to
the lower south summit

304
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:33,911
on the morning of May,

305
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:36,850
the 28th five more climbers
set off from the south Cole,

306
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,360
three lead climbers without a steps for
the two men who had been picked to go

307
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,290
all the way to the top.

308
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,420
Hillary and Tenzing by nightfall.

309
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,900
They help us a turns back and
now it was up to the two of them.

310
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,050
Hillary and Tenzing pitched their tents
below Everest south summit on an Aleve

311
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:55,420
and Ice Ledge at 6:30 AM on May the 29th
they began their final journey to the

312
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,190
summit while climbing a steep slope.

313
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,770
The surface no shifted
carrying Hillary with us.

314
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,570
Then with their oxygen running low,

315
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,130
the two men came to a rock face.

316
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:06,190
It was too slippery to try and climb
hard rock in the crampons fitted to their

317
00:13:06,191 --> 00:13:06,790
boots.

318
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,590
They had to find another way.

319
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,920
Hilary sorta corners attached to a rock
and it started to come away leaving your

320
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:12,291
crack,

321
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,260
stretching upwards between
the rock and the ice.

322
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,020
He crawled into the crack and
grasping the rock in front of him.

323
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,640
He pulled himself further in.

324
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,560
Drowning is crampons into the ice.

325
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,950
He pulled himself through the crack at
the top of the cornice and signaled to

326
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:24,880
Norgay to follow.

327
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:28,300
They now continued along the Ridge hoping
the summit would come into view just

328
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:29,950
as Hillary doubt as if they could go on.

329
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,000
He looked up and sort of sneaky
peek that dropped away on all sides.

330
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:37,420
Hillary himself later recalled
a few more whacks of the ice ax,

331
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:40,750
a few more weary steps
and we were on the summit.

332
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,130
It was now time to celebrate,

333
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:45,280
to take photographs and appreciates
and the best view in the wells.

334
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,350
Then use the terrorist did
finally been conquered.

335
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,780
Reach the outside world on June.

336
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,930
The second Ed was lionized
as the beekeeper from rural
New Zealand who had done

337
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,370
the impossible from Nepal.

338
00:13:54,371 --> 00:13:57,460
He flew to London where he was appointed
a nice commander of the British Empire

339
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:01,420
by the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth the
second he resides in New Zealand as a

340
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:04,900
conquering hero with thousands flooding
the streets to get a glimpse of him for

341
00:14:04,901 --> 00:14:08,590
the awkward and shy young man that
he was this unexpected adulation.

342
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,760
It was hard to get used to a few
months after conquering Everest,

343
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:15,010
Hillary made under the conquest
he won over and married Louise,

344
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:15,850
Mary Rose.

345
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,271
This time,

346
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,530
however he needed help,

347
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,040
he was so shy that he had to rely on his
mother in law to propose on his behalf.

348
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,810
This union later produce three children,

349
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,290
Peter,

350
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:23,800
Sarah,

351
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,550
and Belinda.

352
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:27,490
Peter would become a client and just
like his father reaching the summit of

353
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:31,930
Everest himself in 1990 both Hillary
and Tenzing continued climbing with

354
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:32,300
Hillary,

355
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,840
tackling 10 more Himalayan
peaks over the next decade.

356
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:39,160
On January the fourth 1958 he led an
expedition to Antarctica following the

357
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:40,660
route of Robert Falcon Scott.

358
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:44,740
In 1912 the New Zealanders became the
first to make the track in motorized

359
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:46,860
vehicles with ad writing attractor.

360
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,110
Henrie later became an
unofficial ambassador for
New Zealand's in the 1970s he

361
00:14:51,111 --> 00:14:54,200
commentated on the several and you
went talk ticks sightseeing flights.

362
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,910
On November the 28th 1979 he was booked
to work on flight nine oh one but had to

363
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,680
renege due to other work commitments.

364
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:04,640
That flight crashed into a mountain in
Antarctica with everyone on board being

365
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:05,474
killed.

366
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,240
As the years went by,

367
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:12,130
Hillary returned increasingly to Nepal.

368
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,630
Then he became absorbed in programs of
fundraising and building work for shatter

369
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,270
communities.

370
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,820
In 1960 he established
the Himalayan trust,

371
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:22,120
which was responsible for the building
of many schools and hospitals throughout

372
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:23,650
a remote Himalayan areas.

373
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,210
Hillary received terrible news though.

374
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:29,530
In 1975 tragedy struck with his wife
and daughter Belinda being killed in a

375
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:33,110
plane crash while flying to join him
in the Pool Devastated Hillary and must

376
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:34,330
himself and his building work.

377
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:34,780
However,

378
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,720
this was becoming increasingly difficult
as he was getting more and more

379
00:15:37,721 --> 00:15:38,554
altitude sick.

380
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:43,540
Henry's health deteriorated in the late
1990s on January the 11th 2008 his heart

381
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,710
finally gave out.

382
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,710
He died at the Auckland City
hospital from cardiac arrest.

383
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:48,550
His country,

384
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:50,230
they went into mourning
at a state funeral,

385
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:51,940
was held on January the 20 seconds,

386
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,833
two months later,

387
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,370
a Thanksgiving service was held in his
honor at some George's chapel in Windsor

388
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,760
Castle standing guard outside the chapel
with Gurkha soldiers from Nepal showing

389
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:05,530
that respect for a man who had given so
much to improve the lot of that people.
