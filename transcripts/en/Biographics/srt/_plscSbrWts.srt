1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,160
Maximilian Robespierre promised you Asha,

2
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:02,940
a fairer,

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,240
more representative form of
government to the French people.

4
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:11,190
What they got instead was
a reign of terror that saw
thousands facing the horror

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,323
of the guillotine.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,060
Among his victims were the
king and Queen of France.

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,920
When justice finally came,

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,780
it was a swift as the slice
of a blade in this week,

9
00:00:20,781 --> 00:00:21,601
spire graphics.

10
00:00:21,601 --> 00:00:26,601
We Wade into the terror with a biography
of Maximilian Robespierre Maximilian

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:43,930
Robespierre

12
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:48,640
ends of the world on May the sixth
1758 he was born and harass froms.

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,260
Historians have suspected for centuries
that is family originated from Ireland.

14
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:54,700
By the time the Max was born,

15
00:00:54,701 --> 00:00:58,060
though they had been at French
citizens for many generations.

16
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:00,130
The child was conceived out of wedlock,

17
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,360
but by the time he was born,

18
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,240
his parents had gotten married
like his own father before him.

19
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:04,451
Max.

20
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:05,980
His father was a lawyer,

21
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:08,380
but not for a very successful one.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,370
This left the family with a constant
desks hanging over their heads.

23
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,550
Things didn't get any easier
for the rubber SBE as when Max,

24
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:16,361
his mother died,

25
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:19,300
giving birth to a sibling when
he was only six years old.

26
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:23,140
Looking after four children was
too much for Robert sps seniors,

27
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,140
so his offspring were
divided among his relatives.

28
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:30,910
His mother's death had a profound
impact upon the young Max.

29
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,910
No longer was he the
carefree child of old.

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:34,600
Now.

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,670
He was Sullen and he was serious.

32
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,570
He also applied himself diligently to
his schooling as if he was drowning his

33
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:42,130
grief with his studies.

34
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,660
When he was 11 years of age,

35
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:48,280
young Robespierre was awarded
a scholarship to the least
see Louie la grounds in

36
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:48,940
Paris.

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:53,890
He would continue studying there for the
next 12 years emerging at age 23 with a

38
00:01:53,891 --> 00:01:55,360
law degree as well as law.

39
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:59,950
He also studied literature or rhetoric
and the classics life at the prestigious

40
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:00,430
school.

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,600
It was very structured,

42
00:02:01,601 --> 00:02:03,370
formerly a Jesuit institution.

43
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:06,220
There was now under the control
of the University of Paris.

44
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:09,940
The day began and ended with
formal prayers and Bible study.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,950
The school also has an excellent library,

46
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,590
which Robespierre made liberal use of the
most well known incidents arising from

47
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,230
Robespierre is time at the school of cards
when he was 17 his excellence oratory

48
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:25,540
skills led them to being selected to
give a speech before King Louis the 16th

49
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,550
and Queen Marie Antoinette.

50
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,590
He perfected his wording and practices
delivery only to be snubbed by the role

51
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,800
couple who never even bothered
to get out of the carriage.

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,920
It was a personal violation and one that
he would never forget during his time

53
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:41,671
of the light.

54
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:45,460
Sear Robespierre was also exposed
to enlightenment philosophy,

55
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:48,130
especially the works of Jacques Rousseau.

56
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,750
Rousseau was powerful advocates for a
more democratic form of government coupled

57
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,390
with social empowerment's.

58
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,030
However,

59
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:59,110
Maximilian was not able to read
Rousseau in the library of the school.

60
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,550
His works were considered to be dangerous
and so copies of his famous discourse

61
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,170
published 20 years earlier had to
be smuggled in in his later life.

62
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:13,060
Robespierre would label his later
years of the lacy as a nursery for

63
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,960
republicanism.

64
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,040
By the time he had reached his early
twenties Robespierre was a vocal advocate

65
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,530
for natural rights.

66
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:24,460
He champions the rights of
the underprivileged speaking
as every opportunity.

67
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,091
In fact,

68
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:28,660
he was such an enthusiastic champion
of basic human rights that he became

69
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,900
physically exhausted to
the point of collapse.

70
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,170
Robespierre proved to be an
unstoppable force of nature.

71
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,490
This led to him becoming a familiar
as well known figure in and around his

72
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:40,324
hometown.

73
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:43,660
In the mid seventies and eighties
he joined the academy a verace.

74
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,980
His first speech before the academy
was part of a competition and Sean a

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,280
spotlight upon the lack
of morality and politics.

76
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,870
It didn't win first prize,

77
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,930
but he was rewarded
with a large cash prize.

78
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,650
This wet his appetites and over the next
few years he ended a number of essay

79
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:01,000
and poetry competitions.

80
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,710
He also joins and elites literary
society known as the Receiver Year Club.

81
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,870
Since his graduation with a degree in law,

82
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,470
Robespierre had established a
moderate practice from the very start.

83
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:16,450
He began taking on cases
that were controversial in
1789 he took on the state in

84
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:21,451
a case that directly challenged the notion
of lead tray to cache or imprisonment

85
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,500
without trial.

86
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,371
During the trial.

87
00:04:24,371 --> 00:04:29,371
He actually wrote to the
king and personally requested
his assistance in getting

88
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,450
rid of this abuse.

89
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,980
By the seventies and eighties France
was desperately running out of money.

90
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:48,880
They had spent a lot of money and
assisting the Americans in the previous

91
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,030
decade.

92
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,260
This was compounded by a lavish amount
of spending on the part of the monarchy,

93
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,140
VA appointments of a
succession of finance.

94
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:58,200
Ministers do try and turn arounds.

95
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,640
The country's economy has little effects.

96
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,690
By the end of the decade,

97
00:05:01,691 --> 00:05:05,620
there was a growing call for a meeting
of the estates general representing the

98
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:06,340
clergy,

99
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,050
the inability and the people.

100
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,651
Meanwhile,

101
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:13,420
the king unilaterally enacted a series
of laws to fill the royal coffers.

102
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,410
This included the raising of taxes and
the cutting of spending on essential

103
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,244
services.

104
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:18,941
The following day,

105
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:23,560
the French parliament condemns the king's
actions labeling the raising of taxes

106
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,490
as illegal.

107
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,640
The king's response where stu
simply exile the parliaments.

108
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,300
This,

109
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,320
as you might expect to lead,

110
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:31,690
do growing protests in Paris.

111
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,850
In response to this desperate situation,

112
00:05:33,851 --> 00:05:36,010
a new finance minister was put in place.

113
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,821
This minister,

114
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:39,420
it was [inaudible].

115
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,500
He proposed a new five year plan,

116
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:46,210
which was designed to restore French
credit as well as presenting a full

117
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,140
accounting of the French government's
finances to whoever wanted to see it.

118
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,910
He called for the return of the Parisians
parliaments after their normal autumn

119
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:55,630
break.

120
00:05:55,630 --> 00:06:00,630
The parliaments reconvenes November the
17th 1787 in the rare presence of the

121
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,280
king.

122
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,390
After an eight hour debates,

123
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,570
the parliament failed to
authorize brands five year plan.

124
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,500
However it King Louis the 16th went
ahead and authorize the loans that were

125
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:11,120
needed to restore credit.

126
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:11,840
Anyway,

127
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,070
the king left the chamber,

128
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,390
but the debate continued.

129
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,770
It was resolved that the parliament would
officially condemn the king's actions.

130
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,581
The following day.

131
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:23,600
The leading members of parliaments were
exiled by the king and response to this

132
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:28,010
provincial parliaments across the country
began to refuse to register laws as a

133
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:32,390
protest to the apparently does spotting
actions if the king on May the third

134
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,420
1788 the parliaments of Paris issued a
declaration on the fundamental laws of

135
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,560
the realm is included.

136
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,080
The rise of parliaments
who registered new laws,

137
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,300
the role of the estates General Lens,

138
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:47,450
the freedom of all subjects
from arbitrary arrest.

139
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,410
Despite this,

140
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,700
the leaders of the parliaments,

141
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,430
they were taken into custody
and lead the following day.

142
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,720
A few days later,

143
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,860
the king issued a series of judicial
reforms which were designed to to cement

144
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:58,820
his absolute power.

145
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,530
The reforms effectively neutralized the
parliaments of Paris in response to this

146
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:07,850
outrage prevents your parliaments around
the country refuse to uphold any of the

147
00:07:07,851 --> 00:07:08,750
government's laws.

148
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,830
France was now operating without
any formal justice system.

149
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,990
The country was approaching widespread
public revolts and then attempts to

150
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:27,980
control the damage.

151
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:32,630
Finance Minister Brianne calls for a
sitting of the estates general on May the

152
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:35,540
first 1789 meanwhile,

153
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:39,800
the French government was complete the
bankrupt with no ideas to get the country

154
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:40,550
out of the red.

155
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,550
Brianne was forced to resign and former
finance minister Jack Neck was put back

156
00:07:45,771 --> 00:07:50,420
in office and the general confidence
of the people and managed to recall the

157
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:51,740
parliaments around the country.

158
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,090
The Paris parliaments announced that the
estates general would meet according to

159
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:59,210
the historic precedent where the
representation of the people,

160
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,830
the third estate would be numerically
less than that of the clergy and the

161
00:08:03,831 --> 00:08:04,664
nobility.

162
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,210
This was something that was met
with widespread public disapproval,

163
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,430
three long negotiations with the king.

164
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:10,700
Okay.

165
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,140
I was able to announce in December of
1788 that the representation of the third

166
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:17,750
estate would be doubled
and the estates general.

167
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,380
Meanwhile,

168
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,970
hundreds of pamphlets had been appearing
around Paris with titles such as what

169
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:26,300
is the third estate rather than
being comprised of peasants,

170
00:08:26,301 --> 00:08:27,830
workers or artisans.

171
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:31,130
The third estate was made up
of lawyers and office holders,

172
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,450
the well to do who had enough time to
engage in the Slo process involved.

173
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,890
The pamphlet is strongly criticized the
power of the clergy and the nobility and

174
00:08:39,891 --> 00:08:42,410
the lack of representation of the masses.

175
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:47,470
Several leaders arose among the third
estate and that included Maximilian

176
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,110
Robespierre.

177
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:53,110
By 1788 Robespierre was positioning
himself to play a key role in the coming

178
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,140
revolution.

179
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,650
He participated a series of
debates regarding the makeup
of the third estate and

180
00:08:58,651 --> 00:09:01,920
the ratio of the three components
of the estates general.

181
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,420
He published a pamphlet which address
local issues and arrest with the view of

182
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:10,080
getting himself elected onto the
third estate and the pamphlets.

183
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,310
He strongly stressed.

184
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,750
Two key ideas,

185
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,520
the importance of elected representation
and they concern for the poor.

186
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,091
By now,

187
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:22,860
Robert [inaudible] has a clearly defined
notion of who the enemy was and that

188
00:09:22,861 --> 00:09:24,930
was the clergy and the nobility.

189
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,910
In March of 1789 he was elected as a
representative from our ass to the third

190
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,450
estate.

191
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,080
He was chosen to participate in the
drafting of a list of grievances.

192
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,980
At the same time,

193
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:39,000
he pushed for new incentives that would
give the lower classes access to the

194
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:39,870
political system.

195
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,980
Robespierre is seconds.

196
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,740
Pamphlet was a foretaste
of things to come.

197
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,810
It was called the enemies
of the country on masked

198
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,581
the estates.

199
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,440
General mats on the 5th of May,

200
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,360
[inaudible] 1789 at first sight,

201
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:07,010
30 year old robbers spear was one of
eight representatives from a wraps and the

202
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:08,690
formal opening of proceedings.

203
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,770
He and his fellow third estate members
refused to now before the king.

204
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,780
That first day Robespierre,

205
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:15,890
he began to stand out.

206
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,990
He was not an imposing physical figure
and his voice was less than inspiring,

207
00:10:20,991 --> 00:10:25,991
but he dressed impeccably and had an
amazing ability to recall details.

208
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:29,700
He customarily wore a powdered
wig and they formal waistcoat.

209
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:31,370
In the first week of the assembly,

210
00:10:31,371 --> 00:10:34,640
he forms a breakaway group
known as the Breton Club,

211
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:39,020
which held their own meetings to discuss
the abolition of the privileges of the

212
00:10:39,021 --> 00:10:40,760
clergy and the nobility.

213
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,020
On June the seventh Robespierre gave
a passionate speech criticizing the

214
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,400
excesses of the clergy.

215
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,460
It was one of the major motivators
for the establishment of the National

216
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:51,680
Assembly.

217
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,660
Three days later on [inaudible],

218
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,710
the third estate sent messages to the
clergy and nobility requesting that they

219
00:10:57,711 --> 00:11:02,360
agree to common verification by
headcounts are receiving no response.

220
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,560
They declared themselves the only
legitimate representative body renaming

221
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:08,030
themselves the comments.

222
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,150
The public received this
news with great enthusiasm.

223
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,950
Eventually the clergy under much public
pressure joins the National Assembly on

224
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:19,490
the morning of June the 20th
at the National Assembly
turns up to their meeting

225
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:19,761
place.

226
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,610
Of a sign to find the gate's locked sins.

227
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,360
The entrance man's by guards.

228
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,320
They quickly retreated to a nearby
tennis courts on the grounds of a side.

229
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,330
The members were enraged at the desk.

230
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:32,600
Pot isn't of the king and shutting
out the National Assembly.

231
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:36,980
They unanimously asserted what has
become known as the tennis court oath.

232
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,480
They vowed to remain in session until
the constitution of the realm and public

233
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,630
regeneration are established and assured.

234
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,570
On June the 17th the king
opens the role session.

235
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,930
His first move was to declare
the National Assembly and valid.

236
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,910
He then put forward a 35
point plan for reform.

237
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,590
His final move was to announce this.

238
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,480
Nothing that the estates general did
was valid without his personal consent.

239
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,263
Yeah.

240
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,410
Once the king had dismissed the assembly,

241
00:12:13,411 --> 00:12:15,360
the nobility and clerics filed out,

242
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,780
but the members of the National Assembly
comprising the third estate and the

243
00:12:18,781 --> 00:12:20,580
clergy remained where they were.

244
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,320
It was declared that they would only
leave at the end of bear nets with the

245
00:12:25,321 --> 00:12:27,750
entire country in support
of the National Assembly.

246
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,470
The king,

247
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,303
he backed down.

248
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,570
He owns it the first and second to
states to join the National Assembly.

249
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,950
Still the riots.

250
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:38,850
They did not end Louis send troops
to surrounds the city of Paris,

251
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,870
the National Assembly,

252
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:43,290
and now I've got to work and hammered
out a list of demands to be the king.

253
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:47,520
Robespierre was one of those who presented
them with the first one being that he

254
00:12:47,521 --> 00:12:48,570
removed the trips,

255
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,230
the king.

256
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,460
He ignored the demands.

257
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,990
By the beginning of July,

258
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:54,960
there were 20,000
soldiers around the city.

259
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,660
Robespierre responded by
making a public statement.

260
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,490
No one loves the arms missionaries.

261
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,800
The first lesson of
nature and it's prudence,

262
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:03,900
is to repulse them as necessary.

263
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,960
And so it proved to be on July the 11th
the king dismissed finance minister neck

264
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:11,010
out who was still publicly popular.

265
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,470
This led to rage among the people.

266
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,430
A few days later,

267
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:18,290
rumors spread like wildfire that the
French army was a bouncer launch from

268
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,380
attack on the people and mobs of
citizens reacted to the impending days by

269
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:26,060
seizing at 28,000 rifles
from a veteran's hospital.

270
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,990
They now needed gunpowder to use them,

271
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:28,890
and as they found it,

272
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,680
it's an unused prison in the
city called the bass steel.

273
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,720
The guards tried to hold off the crowds,

274
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:38,721
but then fired into the hundreds of people
fell down debt the now out of control

275
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:42,380
and mob overpowered and killed the
guards and then gained access to the gun

276
00:13:42,381 --> 00:13:43,050
powder.

277
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,940
When the king sent
soldiers to bring order,

278
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,550
they switched loyalties and
they've joined the people.

279
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,860
Louie now new particular trust.

280
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,550
No one,

281
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,230
not even it's protective army.

282
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:52,921
Meanwhile,

283
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:53,970
the National Assembly,

284
00:13:53,971 --> 00:13:57,750
they remained in session in a desperate
attempt to restore order the king

285
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,950
reappointed neck out,

286
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,030
but the finance minister refuse to
work with the National Assembly and was

287
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:05,340
unable to stem the flow of rebellion.

288
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,270
I'm July the 19th he king road through
Paris and a carriage along with key

289
00:14:09,271 --> 00:14:12,270
members of the national assembly
including Robert Spi APP.

290
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:14,490
Rather than crying hours
long live the king,

291
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,540
the people called out long live
liberty long live the nation.

292
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,520
Let me try to play,

293
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:23,700
keep the crowns by telling them that he
had ordered the troops to withdraw the

294
00:14:23,701 --> 00:14:27,270
$150,000 citizens who flooded the streets,

295
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,580
took it as too little too late.

296
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:30,960
Though across the country,

297
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,620
armed mobs were taking to the streets
with many of them seizing control of their

298
00:14:34,621 --> 00:14:35,520
city governments.

299
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:39,150
Starving people broke into grand juries
and the estates of their landlords

300
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,490
helping themselves to food and provisions
while other members of the National

301
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:47,580
Assembly express concern that the growing
chaos Robespierre saw insurrection as

302
00:14:47,581 --> 00:14:49,820
the national expression of the People's.

303
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:50,400
Well,

304
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,650
it was those who opposed revolution
who are actually the real threat.

305
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,800
He became fanatical in his results.

306
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:57,080
He,

307
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,820
we doubt any and all who shaped dissent
to the apparent well of the people.

308
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,481
Meanwhile,

309
00:15:12,481 --> 00:15:15,960
the National Assembly began
working on a new constitution,

310
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:20,130
the declaration of the rights of man
and the citizen was voted on August the

311
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:24,090
26th the king didn't respond to
the declaration in till October,

312
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:27,390
by which time the riots in the
streets were still ongoing.

313
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,140
He expressed concerns at a number
of the articles in the declaration.

314
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,123
At the same time,

315
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:34,860
he called the Alif Flanders
Regimen to society,

316
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:36,540
provide extra protection.

317
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,200
On the morning of October the fifth a
large group of market women marched on

318
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:40,801
velocity,

319
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:42,120
demand flour and grain.

320
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,140
They were met at the gates by Robert's
pm who while showing empathy for their

321
00:15:46,141 --> 00:15:46,974
situation,

322
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:48,270
advised caution.

323
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,910
He managed to negotiate for a
single woman to meet the king lear.

324
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,140
We agreed to allow the release
of two stores of grain,

325
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,310
but again,

326
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:58,860
for Louis it was too little too late.

327
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,820
By evening,

328
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,100
a massive crowd had
gathered at Versailles.

329
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,090
Many of the moms,

330
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,560
they lingered throughout the night.

331
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,371
Then early on,

332
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:08,850
the morning of October the sixth a
group of them managed to break in to the

333
00:16:08,851 --> 00:16:09,720
queen's bedroom.

334
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,070
Meridian managed to escape,

335
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,810
but to have her gods were killed,

336
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,560
but there were a couple were forced to
leave the palace and seek refuge in an

337
00:16:16,561 --> 00:16:17,880
unused palace in Paris,

338
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,870
the Erie,

339
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:22,170
they will follow that by
a crowd of 60,000 people.

340
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,310
The king and queen spend the next few
months as virtual prisoners in the palace

341
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,210
power rested with the National
Assembly among Ridge Rubbers.

342
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:32,550
P has influence with having more
prominence over the next year.

343
00:16:32,551 --> 00:16:35,730
The assembly works towards
a constitutional monarchy.

344
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,870
In June of 1791 the king had
had enough along with his wife.

345
00:16:39,871 --> 00:16:42,930
He disguised himself as a servant
and fledge in the carriage.

346
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:46,890
He left behind the documents which
clearly denounced the national assembly.

347
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:51,000
The carriage journey got 160 miles
outside of Paris and then they were taken

348
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:52,200
back to the palace.

349
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:00,583
Yeah.

350
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,750
The night after the king's
attempts to flee the country,

351
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,010
Robespierre gave an impassioned speech
in which he stated that the deadliest

352
00:17:09,011 --> 00:17:11,560
enemies of the French when the Austrians,

353
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:16,590
he threatened war but counter
revolutionary forces within France itself.

354
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:21,010
He also said that the king should be
counted as one of those enemies of the

355
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:21,730
nation.

356
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:22,563
This speech,

357
00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:25,270
it broke the assembly
into on the one side,

358
00:17:25,271 --> 00:17:29,080
there were those who clung to the
idea of a constitutional monarchy.

359
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:29,530
Well,

360
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,420
those who sided with Robespierre,

361
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,370
we're in favor of republicanism.

362
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,180
Robespierre.

363
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,420
He began to call for the public
trial of the king on July.

364
00:17:37,421 --> 00:17:41,620
The 17th or group of petitioners who
supported the call were confronted by the

365
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:45,190
national guardsmen and the melee
that followed 50 of them were killed.

366
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,220
The French constitution was completed
in September of 1791 effectively putting

367
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:52,530
an end to the work of the assembly.

368
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:57,180
Robespierre resent to harass where he
was welcomed as a hero of the people.

369
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:57,691
Meanwhile,

370
00:17:57,691 --> 00:17:59,730
the king had declared war on Austria.

371
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,630
Robespierre spoke out against the war
stating that it was not in the interests

372
00:18:03,631 --> 00:18:07,860
of the people and he feared that it
would galvanize them around the king and

373
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,570
thus destroy the revolution.

374
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,780
During the spring of 1792 there were
vocal calls for the creation of a French

375
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:15,630
republic.

376
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,290
Robespierre,

377
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:16,920
however,

378
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,580
had changed his tune and was now in
favor of a constitutional monarchy.

379
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,031
However,

380
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,460
when a large protest
outside between early on,

381
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,200
the third anniversary of the tennis court,

382
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,490
oath turns nasty.

383
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,360
He found himself in a standoff
with the kings key enforcer,

384
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,890
General Lafayette,

385
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:36,190
who stood ready to put down the marches
with force protests at the tweeter.

386
00:18:36,191 --> 00:18:39,690
He continued culminating in the king
and queen being forced to flee and seek

387
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:41,370
protection from the National Assembly.

388
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,960
More than a thousand people were killed
that night and it's way the monarchy was

389
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:50,550
officially dissolved in the royal family
were taken into custody as prisoners of

390
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,384
the state.

391
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,610
Following these events,

392
00:19:02,611 --> 00:19:06,060
Robert's be app was elected
to the insurrection commune,

393
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,240
which was the governing body
which now kept order in Paris.

394
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:14,070
He oversaw a period of interrogation of
royalists for a raft of suspected crimes

395
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:14,904
against the state.

396
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:18,690
Many of these royalists prisoners were
pulled from their prison cells by mobs

397
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:20,070
and simply massacred.

398
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:24,330
This is where I'm simply handed to
eventual mob is after mock trials in the

399
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:26,040
first week of September,

400
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:30,450
1970 to around 1,400 people
were killed by these mobs.

401
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,080
Robespierre insisted the commune also
investigate counter revolutionary

402
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:38,670
activities so it would condemned
28 people to death by the heading.

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,470
In the midst of this carnage,

404
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,740
elections were held for a
new constitutional assembly.

405
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:46,260
Rubber spear was elected
as a first deputy.

406
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:50,340
Still there where those within the
assemblies that's rejected to his violent

407
00:19:50,341 --> 00:19:54,720
methods of enforcements through force
or arguments here sidelines than winning

408
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,560
the day with his conviction that
the ends justified the means,

409
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,520
no matter how violent the means
may be the trial of the king.

410
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,290
I'll have again on December the
26th 1792 three weeks later,

411
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,540
he was found unanimously guilty.

412
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,450
Robespierre himself sums
up the will of the Times.

413
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,490
It is where the regrets that
I must pronounce the fatal
truth that King must die

414
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:19,590
so that the country may live.

415
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,420
France executed it's king.

416
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,450
On January the 21st 1793 Robespierre
he did not attend to the occasion.

417
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,780
On July the 20th 1793 Robespierre was
elected to the committee of public safety,

418
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,150
which had been established
just a few months earlier.

419
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,970
The committee began to take action
against federalist revolutionists.

420
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,160
Mass executions were ordered in Leo,

421
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,770
which was a hotbed of royalists sympathy.

422
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,030
Revolts were breaking out all over
leading the convention to declare terror.

423
00:20:58,031 --> 00:21:01,420
The order of the day on September
the 17th they pass laws,

424
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:02,500
allowing them to put to death.

425
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,450
Anyone who was implicated as a supporter
of tyranny caught up in the net of the

426
00:21:07,451 --> 00:21:09,610
reign of terror was Marie Antoinette's.

427
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,780
After a sham trial,

428
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:15,570
she was sent to the guillotine on
October the 16th 1793 Robespierre.

429
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,730
He now set his sights on his
former National Assembly,

430
00:21:18,731 --> 00:21:20,740
opposes the girder nests.

431
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,490
They were do you need tried and found
guilty and sent to the Guillotine?

432
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,820
Controlling all of these
executions was rubbers Pierre,

433
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:32,590
who famously declared to punish the
oppressors of humanity is clemency to

434
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,750
forgive them is barbarity.

435
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,310
Those who were opposed Robespierre in
the assembly found themselves facing the

436
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:40,090
guillotine.

437
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,790
Before long he had absolute
power within the committee.

438
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,880
He had become a virtual dictator literally
with the power of life and death in

439
00:21:48,551 --> 00:21:50,970
his hands along with his immense power.

440
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,350
Robespierre grew increasingly paranoid.

441
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,940
Then there was an attempt on his life in
May of 1793 the following month he was

442
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,710
elected president of the convention.

443
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:03,520
He immediately enacted changes to allow
him to condemn even more people to

444
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:04,110
death.

445
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:08,920
[inaudible] were reduced to
mere condemnations and all
accused were denied legal

446
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:09,880
representation.

447
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:14,380
He even created a new category of
criminal gold enemy of the people.

448
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,970
This blanket term could cover
anything from serving sour wine.

449
00:22:17,971 --> 00:22:19,630
Do sending a letter to England.

450
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:19,811
Yeah,

451
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:20,680
it's the punishments.

452
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:23,920
It was always the same
death by guillotine.

453
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,070
By this time,

454
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,960
Robespierre had gone too far.

455
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,290
The people were beginning to
reject his despotic rule of terror.

456
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,060
His political enemies orchestrator,

457
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,230
they falsified lesser,

458
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:46,350
which appeared to implicate Robespierre
and an attempted coup to Tom.

459
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,520
He defended himself against charges
of dictatorship in a two hour speech.

460
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,181
In this speech,

461
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:54,510
she warned of a conspiracy that was
being hatched against the republic,

462
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,340
but it was all to no avail.

463
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,320
The next day he was arrested
or needs to be freed.

464
00:22:58,321 --> 00:22:59,270
Shortly thereafter,

465
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,900
like trips from the Paris commune,

466
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,220
Robert's Vn and his defenders found
themselves hold up at the Hotel de Ville.

467
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,410
They were declared
outlaws by the convention,

468
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,980
which means that when course they could
be put to death immediately when the

469
00:23:10,981 --> 00:23:14,180
convention forces closed
in on the hotel rather SBM,

470
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,920
and as those who were with him
all tried to commit suicide,

471
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,210
some of them succeeded,

472
00:23:18,211 --> 00:23:19,980
but Robespierre has attempts to blow out.

473
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:24,630
His brain's only managed to shatter his
lower jaw with blondes pouring from his

474
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:25,110
face.

475
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:28,980
Robespierre was laid on the table in the
room of the committee for public safety

476
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:31,950
before being transferred to
the cell that is housed Maria,

477
00:23:31,951 --> 00:23:34,740
and it's going to ask prior
to her date with a guillotine,

478
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,480
the end game for Robespierre on July
the 28th 1794 when he became the final

479
00:23:39,481 --> 00:23:41,190
victim of his reign of terror,

480
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:42,750
seconds before the blade fell,

481
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,280
the executioner ripped off the
bandage that keeping his jaw together,

482
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,250
causing him to let out
an all mighty scream.

483
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,920
It was soon silenced by the deadly blade.

484
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:56,600
Finally ending the carnage that
Robespierre has warped view of justice had

485
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:57,350
wrought.

486
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,870
