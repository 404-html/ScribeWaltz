1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
Fred rogers was a legitimate American
national treasure over 31 seasons.

2
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:10,350
He proved to be the reliable compassion
and always friendly neighbor who guided

3
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:12,510
millions of youngsters
through that childhood.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,980
Fred single handedly introduced
children's educational television in the

5
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:17,670
process,

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,340
elevating a medium that
was heading downhill.

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,900
Fost is radical.

8
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:26,580
Kindness typified by a gentle and personal
manner helps bring sanity to a world

9
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:31,581
beset by problems having Mr Rogers as our
neighbor made the world a safer place.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,800
Frederick mcfeely Rogers entered
the welds on March the 28th,

11
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,251
19,

12
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:46,710
28 at his grandparent's house in Latrobe,

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,580
Pennsylvania.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,391
His parents,

15
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:50,880
James and Nancy were
extremely pious people.

16
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:51,331
So young.

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,520
Fred grew up in a very
religious household.

18
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,010
James Works at the mcfeely brick company,

19
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,390
which was owned by his father.

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,650
He was a hard working industrious men
who taught these traits to his son.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,560
Nancy volunteered at the local
hospital as a nurse's aide.

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,750
She had a deep love for helping others,

23
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,450
which also was a huge influence on fret.

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:10,590
In later years,

25
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,070
Fred would fondly remember how his
mother required everyone in the family to

26
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,790
hand knit sweaters every Christmas
for the troops during the war years.

27
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,150
This family ritual instilled
in fresh I love for sweaters,

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,890
and they became his trademark during his
TV show Mr Rogers neighborhood in years

29
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:26,724
to come.

30
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:31,050
Every one of the hundreds of sweaters
he wore on the show was [inaudible] by

31
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,710
Nancy.

32
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,090
The extended Roger's family was very
close with fred developing a special bond

33
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:37,020
with his grandfather.

34
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,680
The two spent many hours together where
the old man would encourage friends to

35
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:44,190
be himself expressing all of his
feelings and emotions freely.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,030
This had a great impacts on Fred who
fondly recalled how his grandpa had told

37
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:51,750
him that he made his day
special by simply being himself.

38
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,580
Those words made fred feel special and
he made it his mission in life to how

39
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:57,330
other people feel the same way.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,100
When he was

41
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,490
11,

42
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,010
Fred's parents adopted a
baby girl named Elaine.

43
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,340
Fred loved being an older brother even
though elaine proved to be quite a

44
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:11,490
handful away from the love and
the security of his family.

45
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:12,000
However,

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,833
Fred struggles,

47
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,610
he found it difficult to make friends,

48
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:19,110
often finding himself isolated and alone
the other children made fun of the fact

49
00:02:19,111 --> 00:02:22,320
that he was overweight and that he
doesn't join in with that rough and tumble

50
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,100
play.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,880
As a result,

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,680
he became rather quiet and shy.

53
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,490
His parents told him to
ignore the negative feelings
that were welling up inside

54
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:31,590
of him and focus on positive things.

55
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,670
This only made fred felt more heart
and more confused in later years.

56
00:02:35,671 --> 00:02:39,150
One of his key messages to parents was
that children's feelings need to be

57
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:41,580
acknowledged rather than ignored.

58
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,000
The outlet that Fred
stumbled upon two releases,

59
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,190
pent up emotions was the piano
when he was just a few years old,

60
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:47,410
dense.

61
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,190
He would play the piano in
order to sooth fret by five.

62
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,390
He was playing it himself.

63
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,250
He was a natural lands within a few years.

64
00:02:53,251 --> 00:02:56,520
He was so proficient that he would
play for guests and family members.

65
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,470
His acts would also include a puppet show.

66
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:02,260
Fred founds these outlets allowed him
to express his feelings in a way that

67
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:03,790
wouldn't upset other people.

68
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,750
When he was 10,

69
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,970
Fred's grandmother bought
in a piano of his own,

70
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,500
a $25 pump organ.

71
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,730
He spends hours each day practicing with
his time and the keys being the only

72
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:17,080
periods that he felt like he was being
his true self and his early teens.

73
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,910
Fred also became obsessed
with photography,

74
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,370
developing his own brands
in a basement darkroom.

75
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,540
His favorite thing to capture on film
with the expressions on other people's

76
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,290
faces,

77
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:26,981
the Rogers family,

78
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:29,370
they attended the Presbyterian
Church in Detroit.

79
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,640
From the very start,

80
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:32,290
Fred was eager and engaged.

81
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,550
He was entranced by every seven finding
a personal connection to the message of

82
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:39,430
Christianity and the
personality of Jesus Christ.

83
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,260
It inspired in him the deep felt
desire to serve and help other people.

84
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
One Fred entered high school.

85
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,940
He was just a shy and
unsessioned around his peers.

86
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,900
Whenever he did,

87
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,370
however,

88
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,480
develop a very unlikely friendship.

89
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,141
Friends,

90
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:59,440
it could never have imagined that he
would become close friends with someone

91
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:00,050
like Jim.

92
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,883
Standout.

93
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,750
Standout was the popular and talented
athletes and a football player when Jim

94
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,070
suffered a football injury.

95
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:06,461
However,

96
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:09,160
he was confined to a hospital
bed for a period of weeks.

97
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,460
The school assigned Fred to deliver
Jim's homework to him in hospital,

98
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,620
as well as making notes for him in class,

99
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,380
gym and Fred spent time together.

100
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,980
Friends came to appreciate each other.

101
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,290
Fred could see through
Jim's exterior images,

102
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:23,200
the sports hank and Jim could
appreciate Fred's quiet,

103
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,250
thoughtful nature.

104
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,200
When Jim was released from the hospital,

105
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,550
the friendship continued
through Jim's influence.

106
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:31,600
The other students came to realize
that Fred wasn't so bad after all,

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,100
Fred's hadn't changed,

108
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:37,090
but now the other students that's Mba
himself without harassing him from this,

109
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,810
he learns a powerful lesson that he
strived to impart to millions of children

110
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,730
through his TV show decades later.

111
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,800
The yourself without shame.

112
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,800
As a result of his new found
acceptance by his peers,

113
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:50,170
Fred's confidence grew
in leaps and bounds.

114
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,000
He became involved in school activities,

115
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:54,760
becoming editor of the school
yearbook and the newspaper.

116
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,140
By the end of his senior year,

117
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,000
he was president of the student council.

118
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,480
He came to the respected rather
than marks for his quiet,

119
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,500
thoughtful nature.

120
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,640
During his high school years.

121
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:06,550
Fred develops another relationship
that was pivotal in his life.

122
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,280
George Allen was an African
American friend of the family,

123
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:11,320
as well as sharing
Fred's passion for music.

124
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:13,240
Georgia was also a passionate pilots.

125
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,490
He shares his enthusiasm with threads,

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,450
teaching him to fly.

127
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:19,420
While Fred never developed
George's passion for flying,

128
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,410
he was in tranced by Fred's love of
imparting his aeronautical knowledge.

129
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,310
It was then that he learns what
it was to be a true teacher.

130
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:33,360
Upon graduating from high school,

131
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,330
it was Fred's intention to go to
seminary and become a minister.

132
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,340
This seems to be his natural calling,

133
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:41,390
allowing him to serve others just
as his parents had grieved him.

134
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,060
Still,

135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,440
he felt a need to achieve a college degree
and his love of learning inspired him

136
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:49,080
to enroll at Dartmouth
College for his freshman year.

137
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,570
He decided to study the romance languages.

138
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,380
After a year,

139
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:52,860
however,

140
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,650
he decided that what he really
wanted to study with music,

141
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,150
Dartmouth had no program,

142
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,640
was worthy of Fred's talents.

143
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,100
So he transferred to rollins college.

144
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,820
It was during an initial
tour of the college that Fred
ran into his future wife,

145
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,470
Sandra,

146
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,000
Joanne,

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,250
but Sarah became hugely impressed with
Fred's piano playing ability and he

148
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,470
quickly became a part of
his circle of friends.

149
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,710
Fred majored in music composition
and minored in French language.

150
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,200
Prior to graduation in the summer of 1951,

151
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,030
Fred returned home on vacation.

152
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:24,380
He's still fully intended to attend a
theological seminary after graduation,

153
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,390
but everything changed when Fred saw
his first television show on the small

154
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:29,720
screen,

155
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,950
Fred watched is two men,

156
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,990
three pies into each other's faces.

157
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,130
In an instance,

158
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,630
he saw the potential in this new medium
to educate millions of people once at

159
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:39,201
the same time.

160
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:42,440
He was appalled at the low brow way that
television was currently being used.

161
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,160
Fred was so passionate about his desire
to change the way that television was

162
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:46,970
being used,

163
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,180
that he decided on the spot
to give up on his ideas,

164
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:53,520
to join the seminary and
pursue a career in television.

165
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,690
Upon graduating from rollins
with this music degree in hands,

166
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:05,190
Fred applied to NBC television in New
York and asked if they had any positions

167
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:05,790
available.

168
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:08,300
He was hot by a producer
named Charles Polo.

169
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:08,820
Check.

170
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,480
Fred moved to New York full of enthusiasm
only to find that his days were spent

171
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:13,770
running errands.

172
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,050
He experienced the west
and his colleagues,

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,120
especially those in positions of power.

174
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:18,901
In later years.

175
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:23,250
Fred remembered how one boss severely
chastised him in public for forgetting to

176
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,600
put sweetener and his coffee.

177
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,530
He tried mostly in vain to bring
a positive vibe to the office.

178
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,110
Fred's favorite NBC
show was opera theater.

179
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,710
The show collaborated with famous
composers to put on operas that were shown

180
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:36,450
across the nation via the tube.

181
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,910
Fred worked his way up to becoming
a floor manager on the show.

182
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,250
He was in charge of timing the programs,

183
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,240
making sure the cameras are ready and
letting the actors and know when to stop

184
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,260
and went to start.

185
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,430
His attentive personality allows
them to shine in this role for it.

186
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,740
Also became floor manager
on a handful of other shows.

187
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,370
He came to appreciate the wide variety
of uses that television could be put to.

188
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,640
One of the shows he worked
on was the Gabby Hayes show.

189
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:03,630
He watched and absorbed the lesson is
hae spoken to the camera as if there was

190
00:08:03,631 --> 00:08:06,330
only one person on the
other side of the screen.

191
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,730
Ultimately though Fred became frustrated,

192
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:13,080
NBC wasn't showing any interest in moving
into the use of television as a medium

193
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,943
of education,

194
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:18,120
he decided to leave and pursue his passion
to bring music and education to the

195
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:18,870
masses,

196
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,860
especially children.

197
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,090
In 1953,

198
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:21,871
Fred and Sarah,

199
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,250
who had married the previous June,

200
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,910
heard of a new television station
that was opening in Pennsylvania.

201
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,370
It was to be called Wq ed.

202
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,820
They decided that French should apply
and he was offered a job as a program

203
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:33,450
manager.

204
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,530
Wq Ed was the first community
television station in the United States.

205
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,030
Fred saw it as the ideal opportunity
to shape educational content.

206
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,820
A month before w qbd was
scheduled to go live,

207
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,840
the owners decided that a
children's program would be
a valuable addition to the

208
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:49,470
lineup.

209
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,180
Fred's and the young woman
named Tracy carry the stations.

210
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,510
Secretary were tasked with
coming up with something.

211
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,440
The they came up with was
called the children's corner.

212
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,170
The children's corner started out very
simply while Fred worked behind the

213
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:01,680
scenes,

214
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,470
JC introduced free
children's educational films.

215
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,700
On the night before the show,

216
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:06,990
ad station director,

217
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:09,790
Dorothy Daniel gave fred
a small tiger purpose.

218
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,890
As a good luck charm,

219
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,160
fred quickly dubbed this puppet
is Daniel without telling anybody,

220
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,380
Fred positioned himself
behind the backdrop,

221
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,210
which was simply a painted sheet.

222
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,060
As JC began introducing the
first episode live on the air,

223
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,870
he cut a slit in the sheets and Danielle
appeared on screen and it's began

224
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:26,120
conversing with JC.

225
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,270
The bobbitt proved to be a hit with
audiences and puppets became a regular

226
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:32,190
feature of the show on this shape.

227
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:32,491
Fred's.

228
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:36,510
He was obviously the puppeteer as well
as the organ player in order to rush

229
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:40,230
between the cells and the organ he took
to wearing his trademark white tennis

230
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:40,770
shoes.

231
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:41,450
The children's going.

232
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,600
It became so successful,

233
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:44,820
but fred and JC became
local personalities.

234
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,320
The show even came to the attention of
NBC Fred's former employer when they're

235
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,460
head of religious programming.

236
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:54,900
When's on a four week vacation and BBC
invited Fred and JC to fly to New York to

237
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,710
appear live.

238
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,820
Every Saturday morning.

239
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,190
They returned to Pittsburgh
for the Monday morning show,

240
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,820
the NDC Saturday show now exposed
fred to a national audience.

241
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,700
He began receiving hundreds
of thousands of fan letters.

242
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,540
The NBC executives quickly secured
Fred and Josee as regulars.

243
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,800
They also had larger,

244
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:15,801
more professional puppets made NBC put
pressure on Fred and JC to quit w qed and

245
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,670
go daily on that channel,

246
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,450
but the power would not relinquish their
loyalty to the original channel and

247
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,280
they continue to travel back and forth.

248
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,200
Despite his grueling TV schedule,

249
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,890
Fred continued to pursue his dream
of achieving a theological degree.

250
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,460
He attended the Pittsburgh theological
seminary and studied in the late hours

251
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,980
finally achieving his masters in divinity.

252
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,030
The most influential course he took was
a masters counseling course during when

253
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:43,020
she worked with children to see how
they reacted to puppet interactions.

254
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,380
He found that children reacted very
differently with puppets than they would

255
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,580
with real people and would more easily
open up and communicate with a puppet.

256
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,680
Fred was ordained in 1962.

257
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,550
His vocation was to work with children
and families through the mass media.

258
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,271
Specifically,

259
00:10:57,271 --> 00:11:00,600
television plans were put in action
for a Fred's hosted show for the

260
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:01,920
Presbyterian church,

261
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,180
but before he got off the grounds,

262
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:06,030
Fred received the call
that would change his life.

263
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,570
The cool came from Fred Rainsboro,

264
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,950
who was in charge of children's
programming in Canada.

265
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:16,840
He wanted Fred to come to Canada,

266
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:17,201
earns,

267
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,210
puts on a 15 minute daily show,

268
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,710
specifically aimed at children and using
puppets as well as his musical talents.

269
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,420
It was a huge risk,

270
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:26,260
Fred and Sarah,

271
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:27,790
who now had two young children,

272
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,840
but it was everything that Fred had
been working towards and so they bit the

273
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,520
bullet and moved to Toronto,

274
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,540
but when he arrived,

275
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,840
Fred was shocked to realize that Rainsboro
wants them to appear in front of the

276
00:11:37,841 --> 00:11:39,730
camera rather than behind the scenes.

277
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:43,450
Rainsboro had seen Fred work one on one
with children and knew that he had a

278
00:11:43,451 --> 00:11:45,220
special gift to connect with them.

279
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,660
Over the next 12 months.

280
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,350
The two Fred's develops the programs
concept with Rogers finally agreeing to

281
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:51,280
appear on screen.

282
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,130
The show was to be called
Mr Rogers is one word.

283
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,860
Rainsboro felt that this would
make it less formal to children.

284
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:00,550
The show was set up in a neighborhood
with whimsical sets and puppets for Fred

285
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,140
to interact with and then named.

286
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,880
Ernie was brought in as the Babbitt here.

287
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,580
The show was a huge success in Canada.

288
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,031
However,

289
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:09,330
after the initial 12 month
contract was up for Ed,

290
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:13,240
decided to move his family back to the
United States to be closer to family,

291
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:21,560
but even that Pittsburgh Frederick
waited patiently until Wq ed had room in

292
00:12:21,561 --> 00:12:24,290
their schedule for another
children's educational program.

293
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,680
After two years during which he held
an education job with the church,

294
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,730
the funding came through for Fred
to host his own show on w qed,

295
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,440
Mister Rogers' neighborhood.

296
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,710
The show premieres in October
of 1966 for the first year.

297
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,910
It was essentially a rehashing of the
Canadian version of Mr Rogers within 12

298
00:12:40,911 --> 00:12:41,151
months.

299
00:12:41,151 --> 00:12:41,451
However,

300
00:12:41,451 --> 00:12:45,320
the format had expanded and the show had
been picked up by the sears company as

301
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:46,154
a major sponsor,

302
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,440
enabling it to go to a national audience.

303
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,700
Frederick wrote the theme song,

304
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,020
which was to become famous.

305
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,370
Won't you be my neighbor?

306
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,530
The revamped show added more characters,

307
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,011
puppets,

308
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:56,660
and places to visit each episode.

309
00:12:56,661 --> 00:12:59,210
Fred would go out of the
studio and visit a new place.

310
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:04,420
The second national series in 1969 rolled
out in full color in the third season.

311
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,890
The show which had become hugely popular,

312
00:13:06,891 --> 00:13:10,550
was taken over by the Public
Broadcasting Service or PDS.

313
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,570
The first round of Mr Rogers neighborhood
continue to production for a total of

314
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,720
eight seasons and 455 episodes.

315
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:18,920
By then Fred's.

316
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:22,190
He was ready to take a break and
so the show transitioned to reruns,

317
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,940
but Fred's.

318
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,080
We're still busy ever.

319
00:13:24,081 --> 00:13:24,801
The perfectionist,

320
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:28,520
he took the opportunity to fix things
that he didn't like from older episodes.

321
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,870
New original seasons of Mr Rogers
neighborhood began filming in 1979.

322
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:37,990
Between then and 1990 3:15 new episodes
were produced per season which shows

323
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:42,320
linking together and carrying through
one overall theme for the entire season.

324
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,710
The huge popularity over the
show was due to Fred's casual,

325
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,690
inviting and empathetic nature.

326
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:48,703
He never acted,

327
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,900
always striving to be genuine and honest.

328
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,540
His main method of teaching
was through his own example.

329
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,670
As many of as audience
members grew up with him,

330
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,820
the show would starts with Fred's talking
directly to his child audience about

331
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:00,560
the subjects.

332
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,010
Then it would transition to a field
trip which had been filmed earlier.

333
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,460
Then it would be back live where Fred
would move into the neighborhood of make

334
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:10,670
believe this was a whimsical place
where the characters could learn,

335
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,480
explore them,

336
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,370
and to act out specific scenarios.

337
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:17,300
Then Fred would move out
of the neighborhood of make
believe and discuss what

338
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:20,540
had happened in the neighborhood
that day from start to finish.

339
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,000
The emphasis of the show
was on communication,

340
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,700
opening up to others
and exploring feelings.

341
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,060
Fred was not afraid to discuss any
topic that was relevant to children,

342
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,950
including divorce and death.

343
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,020
In addition to these heavy topics,

344
00:14:33,021 --> 00:14:36,700
Fred also encouraged children to have
fun exploring the world around them and

345
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,980
keeping that curiosity alive in 2001.

346
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:45,010
Fred retired at the age of 71
after 31 seasons and 865 episodes.

347
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:46,970
If Mr Rogers neighborhood,

348
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,680
the show was officially over,

349
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,340
but Mr Rogers was still a
familiar tv because of reruns.

350
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,700
Yes.

351
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,940
Who was best known for
his landmark TV show,

352
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,940
Fred Rogers invested his time and
energy into other work as well.

353
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,980
He was involved in the
Children's book business,

354
00:15:03,981 --> 00:15:07,880
held seminars for parents and produced
many documentary style features.

355
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,520
The most well known of these
was a series called Mr Rogers,

356
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,840
heroes and old friends,

357
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,130
new friends for the show.

358
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:16,700
Fred's traveled all over the United
States talking to admirable people.

359
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,200
Fred authored a total of 36 children's
books dealing with issues ranging from

360
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,660
fear of going to the
hospital to potty training.

361
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,740
Fred's passion for children's education
led to his involvement in advocacy work

362
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:28,940
in 1979.

363
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:32,350
He founded a nonprofit organization
called Family Communications,

364
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:32,750
Inc.

365
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,260
He also made his voice heard on the
national level when he became involved in

366
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:37,094
government issues.

367
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:38,390
In 1969,

368
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,690
He appealed to a group of senators in an
effort to stop the federal government's

369
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,340
cutting funding to pbs.

370
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,050
Largely as a result of his efforts,

371
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:49,400
the funding was actually
increased by $10,000,000 in 1984.

372
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:52,940
He was called as an expert witness in a
case between sony and the universal city

373
00:15:52,941 --> 00:15:53,774
studio.

374
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:56,780
The case was about the new sony
technology called beta max,

375
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:58,790
which was the forerunner
of the video recorder.

376
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,750
This new technology threatens hollywood's
and universal brought the case to stop

377
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,490
sony on the grounds of copyrights.

378
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:08,480
Fred testified on behalf of sony stating
the importance of parents and children

379
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,850
being able to tape his
show for viewing later.

380
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,890
Sony ultimately won the case

381
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,110
a year after his
retirement from television.

382
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,940
Fred was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

383
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:25,110
His last public appearance was when he
tossed the coin at the 2003 rose bowl.

384
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,011
A few weeks later,

385
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:27,870
he underwent surgery to
get rid of the cancer.

386
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,650
It was unsuccessful and fred when time
to spend his last weeks with his family,

387
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,660
he died on february the 27th,

388
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:37,230
2003 surrounded by his
family and his devoted wife,

389
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,050
sarah fred's passing was
warned around the world,

390
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,330
but it was felt the hardest
and his native pittsburgh,

391
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,193
Pennsylvania.

392
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,290
His memorial was held there and it
was attended by thousands of people,

393
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,820
including many celebrities.

394
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:51,600
Pbs took steps to help children to come
to terms with the loss of Mr. Rogers.

395
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:54,160
They continue to our reruns
and a special insight,

396
00:16:54,161 --> 00:16:55,320
or fred rogers,

america's favorite neighbor,

398
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,520
was hosted by michael
keaton during his lifetime.

399
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,410
Fred receIved many awards including the
presidential medal of freedom in 1999.

400
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:08,370
He was inaugurated into the television
hall of fame and one of his sweaters was

401
00:17:08,371 --> 00:17:12,450
featured in the smithsonian institute
as a treasure of american history.

402
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,380
The greatest legacy of fred rogers
is the show that made him a national

403
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:16,980
treasure.

404
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,960
The lessons he imparted of tolerance,

405
00:17:18,961 --> 00:17:19,680
compassion,

406
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,100
love,

407
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,580
and empathy are just as relevant today
as they were when Mr. Rogersrogers'

408
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,910
