1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,740
He was the quiet efficience and Osu
ruthless architects of the Holocaust,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,960
Hitler's most loyal sycophants.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,220
He ruthlessly dispatch those seem stood
in his way as he rose to eight position

4
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:14,110
of power that was second
only to that of the fear.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,861
At the end,

6
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:19,530
he spectacularly betrayed his master
Oh need to be felt by his own hands.

7
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,010
In this episode of biographics,

8
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:25,920
we reveal the cold calculating life
and the death of Heinrich Himmler.

9
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,500
Heinrich Luitpold Himmler was born on
October the seventh 1900 after whistled

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,110
Barker Strauss to in Munich.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,130
He was the second of three sons
to Gab Hoss and Anna Marie.

12
00:00:52,131 --> 00:00:56,450
Hemlock Gephardt's was the deputy
headmaster of land should high school

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,430
bandwidths a pious and pedantic man.

14
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,600
The family were well off,

15
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:03,230
but they weren't rich and they held
a measure of prestige in the local

16
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,050
community.

17
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,740
Downhearted previously been the
tutors and the royal of whistles,

18
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:07,820
Bach princes.

19
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,230
It was this connection that led to the
great honor of having Prince Heinrich of

20
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,480
Bavaria as Heinrich's Godfather.

21
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,790
Heinrich was not a well child.

22
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,240
He was often absent from school
with one illness or another.

23
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,750
Still he made up for the absences
by simply working harder.

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,590
By doing so,

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:26,960
he proved himself to be
an excellent students.

26
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,680
A middle school teacher remembered him
as a very keen people whose tireless

27
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:31,371
application,

28
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:32,300
burning ambition,

29
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:36,500
and active participation in class
have achieved excellent results.

30
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:40,220
The man who would go on to persecute the
Catholic clergy without mercy grew up

31
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,830
as part of a devout family of believers.

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,641
As a youth,

33
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,780
he wrote in his diary,

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,780
I would always love God and
remain true to the church.

35
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,651
As a teenager,

36
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,360
Heinrich served as an altar boy,

37
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,320
but when war broke out,

38
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:51,831
he developed,

39
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:55,590
he desire to serve his country in a
military capacity gap party forever

40
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,750
nationalist approved and tried to use
his royal contacts to smooth his son's

41
00:01:59,751 --> 00:02:01,160
path to becoming an officer.

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,760
However,

43
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,470
the 17 year olds was turned down by
the imperial navy due to his short

44
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,340
sightedness.

45
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,001
He therefore,

46
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:12,260
it turns into the army gaining entry and
being sent to officer training school.

47
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,540
But before he had
completed his cadet ship,

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,421
the board,

49
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,040
it was over.

50
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,040
Unlike the Fiera who he
would come to greatly admire.

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,010
Hemlock saw none of the
carnage of the Great War.

52
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:22,850
Fast hands.

53
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:33,291
Hey,

54
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:34,600
April,

55
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,230
1919 Himmler joins one of the many free
corpse army units that winter time ends

56
00:02:38,231 --> 00:02:40,270
to crush the communist movements.

57
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,470
During the next two years,

58
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:45,790
he served in various
paramilitary organizations
that were on the march against

59
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:46,570
democracy,

60
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:50,320
the shame old treaty of Versailles
and Marxists dictatorship.

61
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,470
Young Himmler had been frustrated that
he didn't get to [inaudible] on the front

62
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:54,550
lines during the war,

63
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:56,550
ins lacking any direction he sought,

64
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:01,120
a cause that he could embrace and a
leader that he could respect him and his

65
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:05,680
family had not been inherently anti
Semetic and is that a 27 but he began

66
00:03:05,681 --> 00:03:09,400
reading the Jew bashing pamphlets
that were circulating around Munich.

67
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,180
He also got a hold of the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

68
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:14,140
They faked the documents,

69
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:14,860
the purported,

70
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,860
you contain details of a
Jewish wells conspiracy.

71
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,310
Hemlock came of age in a time when the
old order of things was in a state of

72
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,910
chaos.

73
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,743
The German people,

74
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,583
they were defeated.

75
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,010
Their economy decimated
and their psyche damaged.

76
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,873
Irreparably.

77
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,350
This school was a lot of fear.

78
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,540
There's a lot of depression
in the old order.

79
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,280
Hemler beat,

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,980
son of a royal tutor would have
found a secure place in society,

81
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,870
but now all bets were off.

82
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:40,450
He would have to forge his own path.

83
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:45,550
Gerhard Himmler heard instills in his
sons the two tonic ideal that the German

84
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,320
Aryan was the master human being.

85
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,890
What Heinrich store on the streets of
Munich and the early twenties was the

86
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,990
opposite of Arion and supremacy.

87
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:56,710
The people were fast sliding
into decadence and in morality,

88
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,100
but this was no fault
of the German people.

89
00:03:59,101 --> 00:04:03,970
His readings convinced him
that the countries' ills
could be laid at the feet of

90
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:04,804
one group,

91
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,610
and that was of course the Jews.

92
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,620
Him Low would spend the rest of his life.

93
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:13,650
Championing the two tonic
ideal is constant refrain
when faced with a situation

94
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:17,380
was what would our forefathers
have done in this situation?

95
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,500
Disgusted at what had happened
to his beloved German nation.

96
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:25,120
The young Himmler began making a plan
to emigrate on November the 23rd 1921 he

97
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,100
wrote the following in his diary.

98
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:27,821
Today.

99
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,110
I caught an article from the newspaper
about immigration to Peru where I will

100
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:33,010
end up Spain,

101
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,461
Turkey,

102
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,420
the Baltic countries,

103
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:34,930
Russia,

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,650
Peru.

105
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,960
I often think about it in 10 years time,

106
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,760
I will no longer be in Germany.

107
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,181
Now,

108
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:40,820
a year later,

109
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,100
he was still in Germany,

110
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:43,480
but the dream of living abroad,

111
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,500
it was still with him.

112
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,360
In 1922 he inquired at the Soviet
embassy about moving to the Ukraine as an

113
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:50,200
estate manager.

114
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,921
Interestingly,

115
00:04:50,921 --> 00:04:51,820
two decades later,

116
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:55,840
he would send his death squads into
Ukraine to decimate the lands and to wipe

117
00:04:55,841 --> 00:04:57,370
out it's Jewish inhabitants.

118
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,091
For now,

119
00:04:58,091 --> 00:05:02,350
his greatest ambition was to be
a peaceful agricultural manager.

120
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:02,771
Well,

121
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,130
by the ends of 1922 him,

122
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:07,720
La had completed a degree in
agriculture and settled into a job as an

123
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,210
agricultural assistant
in a fertilizer factory.

124
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,310
Then in 1923 he joins the
Nationalist Socialist Workers Party,

125
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,230
also known as the Nazi party.

126
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,130
He started off as a member of the
paramilitary units under [inaudible],

127
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,630
played a part in the unsuccessful beer
haul putsch in an attempt to seize power.

128
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:27,340
The police through several people,

129
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:29,020
including Hitler himself in prison,

130
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,950
and he was questioned that he was
released because of lack of evidence,

131
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:37,360
but his involvement in the attempted
revolts let him to losing his job as an

132
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:40,300
agricultural analyst
with no money coming in.

133
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,440
We had to move back in with his parents
around this time and the appears to have

134
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:46,450
fallen into a depressive state.

135
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,050
He had a few friends and portrayed
and aggressive volcanic personality.

136
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,370
The Catholic religion,

137
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,930
which had been so dear to him,

138
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,100
was abandoned,

139
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:58,190
and the fascination with the occult
began to take shape unlike a lot of other

140
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,900
new recruits to the Nazi party,

141
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,950
and that was an off immediately overawed
by the presence of Adolf Hitler.

142
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,550
This adoration that he had for the
fear of it develops over a long time.

143
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,350
As soon as his nature him let read
everything he could about by Hitler,

144
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:15,320
he came to appreciate him
first on an intellectual level,

145
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,630
the worship that would come soon enough.

146
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,800
Z now unemployed to 25 year olds,

147
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:30,160
but again,

148
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,880
putting all of his energies into
the cause of a national socialism.

149
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,920
He's are calling the position
of secretary for Greg.

150
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:40,270
All Strasser right pharmacist from land
short who was standing as a candidate

151
00:06:40,271 --> 00:06:43,960
for the Reichstag in return for
a salary of 120 Reichsmarks.

152
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:48,000
He traveled around the Lower Bavaria
on his motorcycle and gave inflammatory

153
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,140
speeches against Jews and communists.

154
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,650
Strasser was a Nazi party member who
was attempting to wrest control of the

155
00:06:53,651 --> 00:06:57,970
organization from the imprisoned Hitler
believing that he would succeed him let

156
00:06:57,971 --> 00:07:02,260
supported Strasser in this internal
power struggle and the other 1920s the

157
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,320
notoriously shy Heinrich found frau line
and us from Bromberg named Margo Tall,

158
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,800
blonde and blue eyed.

159
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,970
She fits the Teutonic ideal and
matched him Liz ideal image of Germanic

160
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:13,600
womanhood.

161
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,210
The couple were married on July 3rd,

162
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:19,150
1928 with Margo bringing a
sizeable dowry to the Union.

163
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:23,110
The financial windfall enabled Heinrich
to realize his dream of owning his own

164
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:28,060
piece of land and they purchased a chicken
farm not far from Munich during this

165
00:07:28,061 --> 00:07:28,520
time,

166
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,630
heavily managed to rise rapidly
in standing within the party.

167
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,490
By 1926 he was deputy had a variety of
propaganda and then deputy Reichsfuhrer

168
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:39,490
ss I then Hitler had been
released from prison,

169
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:44,491
brushed aside the internal threat from
Strasser and published his tone mine camp

170
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,160
Himmler effortlessly switched
his allegiance back to Hitler.

171
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:52,330
He devoured mine camp commenting that
it contained an extraordinary number of

172
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:55,060
truths very quickly
Himmler's loyalty to Hitler.

173
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:57,010
It became absolute.

174
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,600
By the mid 1920 set,

175
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,820
Lou came to the realization that he was
in need of special protection force.

176
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,750
He needed a squad of men who gave him
unquestioned loyalty and we're even

177
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:19,660
prepared to march against
their brothers if need be.

178
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,920
So it had such a force.

179
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,270
No one was as fervently devoted in.

180
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:23,591
Therefore,

181
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:28,330
so eminently suitors has Heinrich
Himmler on January the second 1929 hit or

182
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:31,930
appointed him low to the
position of Reichsfuhrer ss.

183
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,710
But that time,

184
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,330
the SS was a small division of the larger
essay which was under the headship of

185
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,223
Armstrong.

186
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,860
VSA was hitless private taught me
the fighting quality of its men was

187
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:42,640
questionable,

188
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,820
but Ron saw its strength
coming from force of numbers.

189
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,631
In contrast,

190
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:49,000
the SS was a far more elite force.

191
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:53,370
It's members wore black peaked cabs
emblazoned with a skull along with black

192
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:55,150
bordered swastika arm bands.

193
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,070
This new position,

194
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,450
it was ideal for him.

195
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,441
Since his youth,

196
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,190
he had been fascinated by the elites,

197
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,140
praetorian guards that were the elites
protection force of Rem and embarrass.

198
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:08,640
Now we have the opportunity to craft
his own modern day Praetorian guard.

199
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,840
He immediately began putting his own
stamp on the ss he had to bell's buckles,

200
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:15,870
made that were scripted
with the words ss man.

201
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,560
Loyalty is Dayana.

202
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,790
He also came up with a
succinct motto for his men.

203
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,120
Be More than you seem when him assumed
leadership VSS number around 200 men.

204
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:27,871
A year later,

205
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:29,790
it had grown to just over a thousand.

206
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,880
By June of 1934 it had swollen to 50,000
men in 1931 him that created a unit

207
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,220
within that unit and it was called one
C and it was put under the leadership of

208
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:46,140
a rising star called Reinhardt Heidrick
later to become the secret service.

209
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:50,250
This was the organ by which Hitler could
have undercover surveillance undertaken

210
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,420
within the party.

211
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,613
Okay.

212
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,560
By 1934 the essay on the Strom had become
redundant now that he was chancellor,

213
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:09,210
he had no need for a
bunch of street thugs.

214
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,721
In fact,

215
00:10:09,721 --> 00:10:10,980
his association with them,

216
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,110
it was bound to be damaging to his career.

217
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,540
It was time to break this private army up.

218
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:19,290
Him was delighted with the news that
the essay along with its commander and

219
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:19,700
strong,

220
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,660
we're about to be dealt
with for five years.

221
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:25,830
He had been a subordinates to the
uncouth and disorganized rom whom he

222
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:27,750
considered his social inferior.

223
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:30,390
The threw himself into planning
the overthrow of the essay.

224
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:34,680
That history would recall as the night
of the long knives documents before just

225
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:38,520
to show that the essay was planning a
coup and him look personally took these

226
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,290
documents to hit not immediately.

227
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:44,130
Death lists were drawn up containing the
names of essay leaders as well as any

228
00:10:44,131 --> 00:10:45,510
others who were seen by him.

229
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:45,871
Low rent,

230
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:48,090
Heidrick has threats to
their growing palate.

231
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,080
At the top of that list was Ernst
wrong when Rome was taken into custody,

232
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:55,770
Hillary was actually in favor of
commuting the death sentence as long term

233
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,320
colleague,

234
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,090
but he was browbeaten by Himmler
and Heidrick into eliminating him.

235
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,120
This was in calling with
hemlock underlying nature.

236
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,120
He was a man who was
completely devoid of scruples,

237
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:10,560
lacking any of the normal inhibitions
or pangs of conscious that would cause

238
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,990
others to pause in such actions.

239
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,700
Theorists torments and murders if the
night of the long knives were carried out

240
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:18,120
by him,

241
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,590
those assess their leader.

242
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,070
Well,

243
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,850
he was a major beneficiary
off this operation in the
wake of the purging of the

244
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,910
essay him that took over
headship of the Gestapo from um,

245
00:11:26,911 --> 00:11:28,980
and Garing around that same time him,

246
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:29,381
the order,

247
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:30,900
the death of Gerhard Strasser,

248
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:35,130
the man he had earlier supported his
Nazi party leader and it had been his

249
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:35,964
employer.

250
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,163
Yeah.

251
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:50,360
By 1935 hemlock was in a position of
great power within the Nazi state as well

252
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,040
as heading the SS and the Gestapo.

253
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,360
He was also in of the
entire German police force.

254
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,570
This allows him to participate in
cabinet meetings with all the rights and

255
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,180
privileges afforded a
minister of the Reich.

256
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,260
On October the 11th,

257
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:06,880
1936 similar gave a speech in front
of the Academy of German law in it,

258
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,490
he made it clear how he was
going to run the countries,

259
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:11,320
police and defense forces,

260
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:15,340
whether on us our actions conflict with
a particular article or subsection is a

261
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:18,760
matter of complete indifference to
me and the fulfillments of my duty.

262
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,410
I do precisely what I can answer for
them in my work for Fiora and nation and

263
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:25,750
what equates with healthy common sense,

264
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,580
whether or not others whined about a
breach of the law is no concern to me.

265
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,100
Hello was only accepted the very best.

266
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:37,600
Did you tell nick men into the ss the
organization was to be a racial elite

267
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:38,230
class?

268
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,010
Hemlock made sure that he saw
a photo of every applicants.

269
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:45,280
The meticulously scans them in search
of anything that might give evidence of

270
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,114
impurity.

271
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:48,070
Once he found his perfect specimens,

272
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:51,340
he intended to do what he could to
ensure that there were more of them.

273
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:56,430
And so on October the 28th 1939 he
issued his procreation audit to the SS.

274
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,230
It was the highest duty
of women and girls.

275
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,580
Do you conceive children by soldiers
of the SS before they went into battle?

276
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,241
In other words,

277
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:07,480
if a female did not submit to
the sexual demands of an ss man,

278
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,250
she was guilty of treason
to the state and look,

279
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,820
became obsessed with
the idea of procreating.

280
00:13:12,821 --> 00:13:16,900
The worlds with pure Ariens and order
went out so that every ss man was the

281
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:17,470
father.

282
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,910
At least one child,

283
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,160
he considered monogamy to be a sin.

284
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:24,940
His men were allowed to have several wives
in order to be able to father as many

285
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:26,740
future heroes as possible.

286
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,520
Under him,

287
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:41,020
the SS became much more than a
personal body guard for the fear,

288
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,480
and La had been charged with
restoring the nation to health.

289
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,840
This task required reading the
country of racial impurity.

290
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,471
To do this,

291
00:13:48,471 --> 00:13:52,160
the assets would go through community
after community and cleanse it of Jews,

292
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,750
free masons and Jesuits,

293
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:58,010
but Himmler how soon extended the
list of undesirables to include Slavs,

294
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,730
Gypsies,

295
00:13:58,730 --> 00:13:59,600
homosexuals,

296
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:00,800
Jehovah's Witnesses,

297
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:01,760
and communists.

298
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,550
When Hitler invaded Russia in 1941
hymnal or provided actions squad.

299
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:08,660
So you would follow up the regular
army as it conquered the lambs.

300
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,830
Their job was to say gold.

301
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:10,401
All Jews,

302
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,530
communists and Gypsies Himmler insured,

303
00:14:12,531 --> 00:14:15,380
that is men kept meticulous
records of their activities.

304
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,300
One of the squad commanders had recorded
90,000 killings and just the last few

305
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,600
months of 1941 these Moscow murders,

306
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,020
however,

307
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,220
presented a problem that Himmler pat to
provide a solution for having to kill so

308
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:32,020
many people each day was
proving challenging for
the psyches of the soldiers

309
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:32,810
doing the work.

310
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,610
The question that entered his mind was,

311
00:14:34,611 --> 00:14:39,110
was there a more efficient way to kill
that did not lead to such demoralization?

312
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:39,351
Now,

313
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:39,711
of course,

314
00:14:39,711 --> 00:14:43,430
there was no question in his mind that
the course of mass murder was morally,

315
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:45,230
socially and politically correct.

316
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,070
For years,

317
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,400
he had drilled two simple rules
into the minds of his assess.

318
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,240
Firstly,

319
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,850
the Futura was always right and secondly,

320
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,070
the end justifies the means.

321
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,020
He presented the mass extermination as
a monumental secular mission that is men

322
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:04,550
were privileged to be fulfilling after
personally watching the execution of 200

323
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,570
Jews near Minsk.

324
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,290
He said,

325
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:09,620
it is the cause of the great
man to step over corpses.

326
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,610
In the summer of 1941 homeless summons
the common dawns of the Auschwitz

327
00:15:13,611 --> 00:15:16,340
concentration camp Rudolph
halls to a meeting in Berlin.

328
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,550
He informs him that the fear had
ordered the final solution of the Jewish

329
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:20,870
question BSS.

330
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:25,310
He told Hos or to carry out that order
and he had selected outfits as the prime

331
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:26,300
location to do it.

332
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:29,150
Austin out of Eichmann where
to organize the genocide,

333
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,720
but Himmler was the man in charge
under him and watchful gaze.

334
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:37,721
The concentration camps with outfits
as the shining model became incredibly

335
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,470
efficient death factories.

336
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,160
Those passing through the gates of the
camp where we did with those selected

337
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:47,000
going directly to the gas
chambers in less than 15 minutes,

338
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,700
they were dead victims of
the highly poisonous gas,

339
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:52,490
a Cyclin B for those who
are considered fit for work,

340
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,460
that death would come from
exhaustion or starvation.

341
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,110
Himmler paid a personal visit to Auschwitz
in 1942 he watched as victims were

342
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:03,530
selected and to watch through a
spy hole in the gas chamber door.

343
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,450
As the executions were carried out.

344
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:07,160
He did not comment on what he saw,

345
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:11,240
which was assigned to commandant Hos
that he was happy with what he witnessed.

346
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,750
He wins on to inspect the rest of the
camp during which time Hoss campaigns

347
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:18,960
about the squalid conditions and the
dangers of disease to as men and let's

348
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,990
stopped him in mid sentence and declared.

349
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,590
I don't want to hear any more about your
difficulties for an ss officer that are

350
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:25,460
no difficulties,

351
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,110
his duty is always to remove difficulties
himself as soon as they arise.

352
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,200
How you do it is for you
to figure out not me.

353
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,420
By mid 1944 the tide
of war per turn downs,

354
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:48,670
the writing was on the
walls for the Nazi regime.

355
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:49,180
Yes,

356
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,820
him and his unwavering loyalty to add,

357
00:16:50,821 --> 00:16:52,210
I've hit load were still intact.

358
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:53,410
This being the case,

359
00:16:53,411 --> 00:16:57,120
historians have noted that it does seem
odd that with his massive spine that

360
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:57,341
work,

361
00:16:57,341 --> 00:17:00,970
he did not have advanced
warnings of the July 20th,

362
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,930
1944 plot to kill Hitler.

363
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,410
Some of you even speculated that
he was involved in some way.

364
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:05,651
Now.

365
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:09,130
It is true that three days before the
attack he turned down a written Gestapo

366
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:10,870
request for permission to arrest.

367
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:14,710
Two of the main plot is it's also clear
that the ruthlessness with which the SS

368
00:17:14,711 --> 00:17:18,490
persecution machine went into action
after the attack was not matched with.

369
00:17:18,491 --> 00:17:21,520
It's usually impeccable standard
of surveillance before it.

370
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,390
It is probable that him that did not
intend to portray Hitler on July the 20th

371
00:17:25,391 --> 00:17:29,440
of 1944 but that betrayal it was to
come and it would manifest itself on the

372
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:33,460
fear as birthday April
the 20th 1945 on that day,

373
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:37,150
Himmler was a guest along with other
high ranking Nazi is it what must surely

374
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,880
have been one of the most macabre
birthday parties in history?

375
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,830
It was held in the underground bunker
that was there's final hideout situated in

376
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:46,320
the heart of ravaged Berlin.

377
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,360
Hitler was unaware that him and I had a
second later that day with an emissary

378
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,950
from the world congress of Jewry.

379
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:57,330
He proposed that the Jews and the national
socialists bury the hatchet and the

380
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:01,230
concentration camp inmates would be handed
over to the Red Cross just a few days

381
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:01,350
earlier.

382
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:05,660
He had given orders that no camp survivors
were to fall into enemy hands and no

383
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,170
camps were to be surrendered.

384
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,370
His about face was clearly a matter of
expediency in and attempts to minimize

385
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,610
the ire of the allies when they discovered
the horrors that have been taking

386
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:15,870
place under his watch.

387
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:16,763
Three days later,

388
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,520
him the held talks with the Swedish
diplomat counter full could burn a dotake.

389
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,090
Yeah.

390
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,870
He presented a surprising office saying
that's in order to save Germans from the

391
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,460
full force of a Russian invasion.

392
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,070
He was prepared to
surrender the western front,

393
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,920
but not the eastern front handle.

394
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:34,860
The believed that he could negotiate
directly with President Eisenhower and

395
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,850
wondered out loud whether he should
shake the president's hand or offer him a

396
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:39,840
Nazi salute.

397
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,860
Of course,

398
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,130
Himmler's clandestine visits
were meant to be top secret.

399
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:44,491
However,

400
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:48,270
somehow they got leaked to the media
runs on April the 28th for London's BBC

401
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:52,440
broadcasts that Himmler was claiming
that Hitler was dead and that he was his

402
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,080
successor in the Berlin bunk.

403
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:56,610
There was monitoring the
airwaves and this news,

404
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:56,821
well,

405
00:18:56,821 --> 00:18:57,111
it seemed,

406
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,430
found its way to the fear up.

407
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,210
Hitler was dumbstruck.

408
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:04,680
He could accept betrayal from anyone
else but never from his loyal him that he

409
00:19:04,681 --> 00:19:08,880
called it the most monstrous betrayal
in world history and he immediately

410
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,050
ordered him less arrest,

411
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,150
but within days Hitler,

412
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,043
he was dead.

413
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,790
The victim of his own hands

414
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:25,421
on May,

415
00:19:25,421 --> 00:19:29,800
the first Hemena mass with
headless admiraal called
donuts at the naval barracks

416
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:31,720
at [inaudible] donuts was wary.

417
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:33,430
Even though Himmler had been deposed,

418
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,880
there was no telling how much allegiance
the men of the SS would still give to

419
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:37,180
him.

420
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,220
Him Lo was shown his letter of dismissal,

421
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:39,911
ignoring it,

422
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:43,510
so you congratulated on it's on his
appointments and offered to work with them

423
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,740
as his second in commands.

424
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,071
Don,

425
00:19:45,071 --> 00:19:45,904
it's declined.

426
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,700
The using was over and Daimler
it was allowed to walk away.

427
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:52,940
He now resolves to Kevin's a hiding and
bide his time before coming back to lead

428
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,690
as all powerful assets
on a search to up on May.

429
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:57,880
The 20 seconds with the
war over in Germany.

430
00:19:57,881 --> 00:20:01,780
Under allied occupation of British patrols
spotted a group of ragged looking man

431
00:20:01,781 --> 00:20:02,890
outside of Hamburg.

432
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,030
One of them were short,

433
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:05,530
thin man with a black eye patch,

434
00:20:05,531 --> 00:20:09,610
told them his name was Heinrich Pittson
gun and then produced forged identity

435
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:10,150
papers.

436
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,310
He was dressed as an
ordinary German soldier.

437
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,800
The seven men were in fact
Himmler and his body guards.

438
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,010
The British guards took the group into
custody and placed them in a prisoner of

439
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:19,450
war camp just outside of Bremen.

440
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,810
It didn't take long for the proud Himmler
to chief under the common treatments

441
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,600
that he was receiving as
merely a captured soldier.

442
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:26,471
After a few days,

443
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:30,010
he requested in an audience with the camp
commander expecting to be treated with

444
00:20:30,011 --> 00:20:30,940
newfound dignity.

445
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,980
Hemler announced his true identity,

446
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,760
but rather than being respected for his
position as the Nazi number two man,

447
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,740
his captors treated him with contempt.

448
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:42,580
He was forced to stripped completely and
as captains of 24 hour watch to prevent

449
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:45,600
a suicide the following day him lo
was brought before the camp commander

450
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,350
differentt derogation in mouth.

451
00:20:47,351 --> 00:20:50,920
He had secrets it as an MP with poison
which had been issued tool top Nazis and

452
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:52,090
which they always carried with them.

453
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:55,900
A body search was ordered and when the
doctor tried to examine him in his mouth,

454
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,220
he bit down on the ampule.

455
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,490
The enraged British tried desperately
to clear the poison from his system,

456
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,680
but it was no good within 12 minutes,

457
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,240
Himmler was dead.

458
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,180
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

459
