1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,840
Pablo escobar was the world's
most successful drug trafficker.

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:04,983
He was also,

3
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,970
it's nice deadly.

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,500
During his 17 year reign at the top
of the Colombian cocaine and bar,

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,410
he ordered the killings
of thousands of people,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,640
including judges,

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,900
ministers of parliaments,

8
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:17,880
and even presidential candidates.

9
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,960
At the height of his power,

10
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,740
he was raking in over a
million dollars a day.

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,060
Yes,

12
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,551
in the end,

13
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,270
he was forced to live as a
fugitive in the Colombian jungle.

14
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,480
Shut down on a rooftop in
the city that he ruled over.

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,600
His was an epic fall from grace and this
episode of biographics we go deep into

16
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:36,241
the south.

17
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:40,890
American drug dwells to reveal
the true life of Don Pablo

18
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,180
Pablo Emilio Escobar.

19
00:00:58,181 --> 00:01:01,810
Gaviria was born on December the
first 1949 in the small town.

20
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,080
Every now grow 45 minutes from Midian.

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:04,900
Colombia,

22
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,650
his father able was a hardworking,

23
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,870
humble cattle farmer.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,711
One his mother,

25
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:10,890
her Milda was a school teacher public.

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,480
The seconds of seven children was raised
in a middle class environment and a

27
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:18,460
community that was fueled by
the cocaine and marijuana trade.

28
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,970
Although not everyone's directly
participated in the drug business.

29
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:27,100
They all had a powerful incentive in
the protection of those that did the

30
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:27,551
violence.

31
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:31,900
That was part and parcel of enforcing
the narcotic straight with all around

32
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:32,200
them.

33
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,160
Before starting school,

34
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,410
the family moved to end avocado,

35
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,660
a small village just outside
of [inaudible] so that her
Milda could establish an

36
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:41,470
elementary school that Abel sold the farm
and took up a job as a neighborhood to

37
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,840
watch man through hard work at the school.

38
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:44,200
Her milled,

39
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:48,460
it soon became a popular
and well respected member
of the community at school.

40
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,130
Pablo proved himself to be
enabled and quick witted students,

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,230
although tending toward the Chubby side,

42
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:54,760
thanks to his love of fast food,

43
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,440
he was talented in all ball sports
with a special love for soccer.

44
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,200
Many of us teachers were
involved in social causes,

45
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:06,610
especially the struggle for classic
quality and they became very powerful

46
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,710
influences on the young Pablo.

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:12,180
By the time he was in his early teens
public was attending street rallies and

48
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:16,370
participating in such activities like
throwing rocks at the police probably

49
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,710
became part of a youth culture
movement known as an a day Smoot,

50
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,700
which encouraged young people to thumb
their noses at the established order they

51
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:28,360
were to do things like disobey their
parents and write their own rules.

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,770
Part of this counter cultural movements
involved experimentation with drugs

53
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:37,360
leading the 13 year old future drug
kingpin to develop an addiction to

54
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:38,140
marijuana,

55
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,250
which would never leave him.

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,673
Okay.

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,310
By the age of 16 Pablo had developed into
a plumper shorter youth standing just

58
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:55,840
over five foot six inches.

59
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,600
He had a round face and
what a slight mustache.

60
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,330
A couple of before
reaching his 17th birthday,

61
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,860
he dropped out of school board with the
straight laced routine and keen to make

62
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,270
his own way in the wells.

63
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,500
After quitting school,

64
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,500
the enterprising pab lobe
started up a bicycle repair shop.

65
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,040
He would prowl the streets,

66
00:03:13,041 --> 00:03:17,380
sends the local dump in
search of discarded bicycle
parts and then use them to

67
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:21,070
fix bikes are cheap with the money
that he made from this enterprise.

68
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,100
He purchased himself a
Lambretta motorcycle.

69
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,020
Now with a means of foster escape,

70
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:29,890
he began planning how to make more
money more easily than the by repairing

71
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,450
bicycles for a pittance.

72
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,500
According to legends,

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,670
Pablo Foray into crime began with him
stealing headstones from the local

74
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:37,750
cemetery sounds,

75
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:40,390
blasting the names from them
and then reselling them.

76
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,250
Pablo then decided though that the root
to quick cash lay in commercial business

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,820
rubbery.

78
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,340
He started by scoping
out potential targets.

79
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,040
He would then ride to the target
business on his motorbike,

80
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,360
set Abella cover over his head and rush
to the business with a knife or a gun in

81
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:55,750
hand,

82
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,680
demanding money,

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,180
and then be got out of that.

84
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,150
All of this would happen
in about 30 seconds.

85
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:01,320
Well,

86
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,120
after a few successful robberies populate,

87
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,540
recruited his cousin to join him.

88
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,870
One would ride the bike and act as the
getaway writer while the other stormed

89
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:08,800
into the business.

90
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,270
But within a few months,

91
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:10,471
patty,

92
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:14,740
they became bored of this and moved
onto bigger and it's easier things.

93
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,780
He established a contact with a rent,

94
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,920
a car dealership.

95
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:22,180
He would provide him with copies of the
keys to cars that he had just sold along

96
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:23,650
with the addresses of the buyers.

97
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,970
All the Pablo had to do was turn up at
the address and drive the cars away.

98
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:28,960
In his late teens,

99
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:32,480
they public got caught in the act
of stealing one of these cars.

100
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,410
He ended up spending several
months in Lala Dara jail,

101
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:38,170
which was to him a very
positive life experience.

102
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,220
It was in this jail cause he learns how
to move into bigger criminal activity,

103
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,510
including kidnapping,

104
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,673
drug trafficking.

105
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:56,030
One SPEC on the street,

106
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,080
Pablo and his cousin,

107
00:04:57,081 --> 00:04:57,621
Gustavo,

108
00:04:57,621 --> 00:04:59,540
went right back to stealing costs.

109
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,960
They built up a collection
of stolen engine parts,

110
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,530
which they would sell off bit by bit.

111
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,670
The bear then took to building race cars
with Pablo competing in local events.

112
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,810
Pablo Ans Garcia weren't the only
ones stealing cars in metagene though,

113
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,540
which led to an extension
of his operation.

114
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:19,630
He decided to also sell protection so
the people would pay him to ensure that

115
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,590
their car did not get taken.

116
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,250
Ballet was able to provide such a service
because he had developed a reputation

117
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,220
as an unpredictable
and violence young man.

118
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,920
If anyone who didn't money
probably would hire a local thug,

119
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,300
do you kidnap that person?

120
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:35,960
He would then ransom him for whatever
was owed to him from time to time.

121
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:40,100
He would even have that person kills when
the ransom was paid simply to engender

122
00:05:40,101 --> 00:05:44,150
fear in those he dealt with before
long paddlow decided to specialize in

123
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:45,770
kidnappings for their own sake,

124
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,110
along with his cousin and
future brother in law.

125
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,650
He nabbed a rich businessman by
the name of Diego Acca Varia.

126
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,610
This man was intensely disliked by
many of the poor workers in Midian.

127
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:00,290
He were being laid off
droves by industrialists
like him despite the family.

128
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:00,661
Okay.

129
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:02,630
In the $50,000 ransom demands.

130
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,310
Echo varia was beaten,

131
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,060
strangles and then dumped in a ditch
even though he had just committed a

132
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,841
terrible crime.

133
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:12,140
His choice of victim made
Pablo hugely popular.

134
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:15,080
Among the common folk have
met a yin in a strange way.

135
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,580
They saw the killings as public
striking a blow for social equality.

136
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:29,990
Sorry.

137
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,990
In 1971 the 22 year old Pavlo began
working for [inaudible] based Contraband

138
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,170
Dealer Alvara Prieto underappreciated.

139
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,580
Pablo was doing a modest amount
of drug trafficking before long.

140
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,270
However,

141
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,990
he decided that he wanted more of
a slice of the pie for himself.

142
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,770
He drove his stolen running four to
Ecuador and bought five kilograms of

143
00:06:48,771 --> 00:06:52,970
Peruvian cocaine paste successfully
passing through a number of police and

144
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,020
military checkpoints.

145
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,260
He returned to Midian where
he processed the cocaine.

146
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,090
He next contacted fellow criminals.

147
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,500
The Ochoa brothers just set up a sale
to a local cocaine chief called fattier

148
00:07:03,501 --> 00:07:04,334
Restrepo.

149
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,410
The sale netted Pavlo close to
$100,000 far surpassing anything he had

150
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:14,180
previously done and setting himself up
firmly on the path to becoming a high end

151
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:16,010
drug dealer within two months.

152
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,930
February Restrepo had been murdered.

153
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,110
Suddenly there was a new man of the head
of the [inaudible] cocaine operation,

154
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,760
and that was Pablo Escobar.

155
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,840
Now importantly,

156
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,640
it has never been conclusively proven.

157
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,290
The Pablo murdered Restrepo,

158
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,140
but that was what everyone
involved believed.

159
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,860
The majority of people working for
Restrepo were upper class dandies.

160
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,760
They were pretty frightened by Pablo
and the ruthless hoodlums that he

161
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:38,900
surrounded himself with.

162
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:41,560
Shortly after muscling his
way to the top of the median,

163
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,500
cocaine's indicas.

164
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,870
Pablo married 15 year old Maria,

165
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:45,561
Victoria,

166
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:46,670
Helena Vallejo,

167
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,593
so now Pablo,

168
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,980
he was 26 years old.

169
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,903
He had a wife,

170
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,590
he had wealth and he had power.

171
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,680
It really seems like the sky
was going to be the limit.

172
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,980
The cocaine trade from Panama through
Columbia and into the United States boomed

173
00:08:00,351 --> 00:08:04,190
in the late 1970s with most of it
being trafficked through Escobar's

174
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:08,300
organization under pablet with the
cocaine industry became streamlined.

175
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,040
He purchased a fleet of
airplanes including a Leer
jet transport the drugs into

176
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,480
the United States where there was an
inexhaustible supply of willing buyers.

177
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,750
Two months after his wedding though
Pablo and four others were arrested,

178
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,850
resounding from a drug run to Ecuador,

179
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:27,440
drug enforcement agents founds 39 kilos
of cocaine isn't in the spare tire of

180
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:28,160
their truck.

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,640
Vast amounts of coke would
see Pablo put away for a long,

182
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,660
long time.

183
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:36,320
His first tactic and getting out of
the mess was to bribe the trial judge.

184
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,950
The offer,

185
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,371
however,

186
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:38,750
was flatly rejected.

187
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,450
How beloved then had his team recently,

188
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,510
the judges backgrounds,

189
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:45,290
they discovered that he had a brother
who was a lawyer and that the two men did

190
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,100
not get on.

191
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,090
The lawyer was contacted and offered a
huge amounts to represent Pablo in the

192
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:50,750
case.

193
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,531
As suspected,

194
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:55,420
the judge was forced to recuse himself
due to the conflict of interest and the

195
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:55,891
new judge.

196
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:56,220
Well,

197
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,130
he had less scruples
about taking the payments.

198
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:02,490
He accepted the bribe and Pablo
and his cohorts walked free.

199
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,050
Exorbitant amounts of money.

200
00:09:04,051 --> 00:09:07,350
We're now pouring into Colombia
with deposits in the countries.

201
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:12,351
Four major banks doubling between 1976
and 1980 [inaudible] was then able to use

202
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:16,170
his millions to take possession
of every step of his operation.

203
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,370
Traveling to Peru,

204
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,000
Bolivia,

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,810
and it's Panama,

206
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,260
and buying up all the cultivation
farms and processing plants.

207
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,670
He was also able to buy off enforcement
agencies in every country developing a

208
00:09:26,671 --> 00:09:30,750
ruthless policy which came
to be known as silver or led.

209
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,850
If officials didn't accept his bribe,

210
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,980
they could expect to end up debt.

211
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,200
By 1980 Pablo was at the absolute height
of his power with every law enforcement

212
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,400
agency on his payroll.

213
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,040
He was the unofficial king of Midian.

214
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,270
He wasn't the only cocaine,

215
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:46,770
Impresario and Columbia,

216
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,560
but he certainly was the most successful.

217
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,000
He owns multiple mansions.

218
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:51,930
He had racing cars,

219
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,550
helicopters and planes,

220
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,330
and was constantly surrounded by
bodyguards and hangers on cocaine.

221
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,560
Money absolutely transformed many in
with discos and high and restaurants

222
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,090
opening up all over the city.

223
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,110
One of paddleloons passions was soccer
and now he was able to indulge it.

224
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,130
He paid to have fields levels and sorted
and lights installed so that he and his

225
00:10:11,131 --> 00:10:12,960
crew could play at nighttime.

226
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,770
He also employed professional game
callers to announce the matches as if they

227
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,890
were an FAA Cup final in
1979 papillary wheels,

228
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,420
a lavish country estate.

229
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,430
On a 7,400 acre ranch,

230
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,160
80 miles outside of Midean and dws,

231
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,990
Hacienda Las and Apollos.

232
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,010
He brought exotic animals from all
over the worlds to populate the farm,

233
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:36,870
built six swimming pools and a huge
mansion that could sleep 100 guests at the

234
00:10:36,871 --> 00:10:41,360
same time that he was indulging his
every materialistic women private Pablo

235
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,470
began tending to his public image.

236
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,610
He constantly denied that he was
involved in any illicit activity,

237
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,080
portraying a formal,

238
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,900
likable persona and
appearing humble and polite.

239
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,470
He consciously cultivated the image
that he was a freedom fighter for the

240
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:56,304
underprivileged,

241
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,310
setting himself up as an
alternative to the establishment.

242
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,090
He also poured millions of dollars
into social construction programs.

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,120
Between 1980 and 1982 Pablo did more
to help the poor and meti in than the

244
00:11:08,131 --> 00:11:09,930
Colombian government had ever done.

245
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,750
One of his most popular
initiatives was a housing projects.

246
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,210
There was called Barrio Pablo Escobar,

247
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,410
where houses were bills,

248
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:19,680
and it's given us a families who had
previously been sheltering in shacks.

249
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,690
The city dump this and a host of other
projects easily made him the most popular

250
00:11:24,691 --> 00:11:27,090
citizen in [inaudible] in private.

251
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:29,880
Pablo conducted himself
in an understated manner.

252
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,140
He spoke softly and was generally relaxed
and casual with the people around him.

253
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,260
He was also hugely
self-indulgence with food,

254
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:38,580
with drink and with women,

255
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,550
and he considered himself
a law unto himself.

256
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,630
As an example of this,

257
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:45,540
on one occasion when an employee
was found to have stolen from him,

258
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,770
Pablo had him brought before him bound
hand and first and then kicked it into

259
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:50,570
the swimming pool.

260
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,320
They can everyone watch as the man drowns

261
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,870
with his popularity among the masses
firmly established and his dominance over

262
00:12:07,871 --> 00:12:09,070
his empire assured.

263
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,010
The next logical step
for Pablo was politics.

264
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,720
His path to and legitimate office
began in 1978 when he was elected as a

265
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:21,010
substitute city counselor in met a
year in 1980 he gave his personal and

266
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,640
financial support to the formation of
a new national political movements,

267
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,990
the new Liberal Party.

268
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:31,110
Then in 1982 he ran for and was elected
to Congress all the as a substitute who

269
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,080
attended when the primary delegate
from that a yin was unavailable,

270
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,820
a major perk of being elected to
Congress was that now Pablo had judicial

271
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:40,683
immunity,

272
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,710
meaning that he could not be convicted
for any crime under Colombian law.

273
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,530
The position also afforded
him a diplomatic visa,

274
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,520
which he made you solve to regularly
take his family on trips to the United

275
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:51,670
States.

276
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,570
On one of these trips,

277
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:55,720
he purchased an $8 million
mansion in Miami Beach,

278
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:56,350
Florida.

279
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,100
So public now had political legitimacy
to go with his massive wealth.

280
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,100
And the next acquisition you
made was a personal army,

281
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,310
one of friends of the family.

282
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:06,220
He was kidnapped by m 19 gorillas.

283
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:09,310
He created a private militia
to hunt down these rebels.

284
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:12,190
Pablo Blues Army was known
as death to kidnappers.

285
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,540
So Pablo is wider exposure as a
result of his political office.

286
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,930
When it was the beginning
of his downfall in Midian,

287
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,480
Pablo,

288
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,880
he was viewed as this Robin Hood figure,

289
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,660
but when he'd tried to gain the
favor of polite Colombian society,

290
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,010
he was not welcomed.

291
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:32,070
They viewed him as what he really was a
ruthless cocaine king with absolutely no

292
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:35,530
scruples when he turns up to take a
seat in Congress as an alternate for the

293
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:39,850
first time on August the 16th 1983
with a bevy of bodyguards in tow,

294
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,640
he was first denied entry
for not wearing a tie.

295
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,700
He quickly got hold of one and
swept since the Pax Chamber.

296
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,600
He slumps down in his allocated
seats and began nervously to bite his

297
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,434
fingernails.

298
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,280
Immediately the chamber president stood
up and demanded that all body guards be

299
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,480
removed from the chamber.

300
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,990
Pablo nodded and just thugs
left the room within minutes.

301
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:03,520
Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara was on
his feet defending a claim of corruption

302
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,840
that had been brought against him.

303
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,550
Laura pointed his finger at Pablo and
stated we have a congressman who was born

304
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,290
in a very poor area himself,

305
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:11,711
very,

306
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,350
very poor and afterwards
through a stage of business,

307
00:14:14,351 --> 00:14:16,660
deals in bicycles and other things.

308
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:20,890
Appears with a gigantic fortune with
nine Blaine's three hangers at the media

309
00:14:20,891 --> 00:14:25,150
unit airport and creates the movement
death to kidnappers while on the other

310
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:25,510
hands,

311
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:29,710
mountains charitable organizations with
which she tries to bribe a needy and

312
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,910
unprotected people.

313
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,810
Now there are investigations going in the
United States of which I cannot inform

314
00:14:34,811 --> 00:14:39,190
you here tonight in the House on the
criminal conduct of Pablo Escobar.

315
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:39,581
Now,

316
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,740
Pablo said nothing in the house,

317
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:45,460
but when he left he was besieged
by reporters breaking free.

318
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,200
He stormed off through his lawyer.

319
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,200
He informs Laura that if he did not
present evidence of his claims within 24

320
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:51,770
hours,

321
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,270
he would face legal action.

322
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,610
Laura willingly obliged
and then the coming days,

323
00:14:55,611 --> 00:14:59,870
the newspapers were filled with all sorts
of revelations about Pablos criminal

324
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,733
activity.

325
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,250
Pablo was now persona non
grata in political circles.

326
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:18,540
He was kicked out of the new Liberal
Party and theU s embassy revoked has

327
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:19,560
diplomatic visa.

328
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,340
The Catholic church also renounced their
supportive and the governments even

329
00:15:23,341 --> 00:15:26,520
seized 85 of the exotic
animals on Pabla his ranch,

330
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,830
claiming that they had
entered the country illegally.

331
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,430
Pablo,

332
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,740
his political career is now in ruins.

333
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,790
Even worse for Pablo be Colombian
governments at Laura's urgings was fast

334
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:39,390
tracking an extradition treaty with the
u s that would see him trying in America

335
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,100
for selling cocaine in that country.

336
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,160
In May of 1984 justice minister Lara
was shot seven times while riding in his

337
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,490
chauffer driven limousine,

338
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,830
but Pablo had powerful enemies.

339
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,970
US President Ronald Reagan had announced
a major crackdown on the cocaine trade

340
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,170
with the death of Laura.

341
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,010
The Colombian government were willing to
cooperate with American authorities to

342
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:01,530
go after narco kingpins and Pablo.

343
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,120
He was the biggest of them all.

344
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,710
The killing of Lara also turns much of
the Colombian population against Pavlay

345
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:08,640
by this act.

346
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,650
He had declared war on
the state for Pablo.

347
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,060
The heat was too much to bear and he
skip the country taking a helicopter to

348
00:16:15,061 --> 00:16:15,960
Panama City.

349
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,290
Yet,

350
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,150
despite being offered asylum in Panama,

351
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,140
just the year before,

352
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,260
Pablo and his cronies were
not welcomed by the authority.

353
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,300
After just a few weeks in exile Pablo,

354
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,040
he was desperate to get back home.

355
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,030
He made overtures to the
Colombian government's
drafting a proposal whereby he

356
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,810
would go straight and he uses massive
influence to read Columbia of drug

357
00:16:33,811 --> 00:16:34,470
trafficking,

358
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,040
provided that he could retain his
possessions in Midian and that he would be

359
00:16:38,041 --> 00:16:41,760
exempt from arrest or
extradition to the United States.

360
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,080
There's other though it was
roundly rejected when the
Panamanian army rated one

361
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:48,480
of the labs that he had situated
on the Colombian border.

362
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,610
He fled Panama for Nicaragua.

363
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:51,271
Meanwhile,

364
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:55,050
he was hearing that his
absence from Columbia was
undermining his control of the

365
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:55,980
median cartel,

366
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,930
the kidnapping of a 73 year old father.

367
00:16:58,410 --> 00:16:58,531
Well,

368
00:16:58,531 --> 00:16:59,580
that was a step too far.

369
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:00,480
Pablo audit,

370
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,260
a killing frenzy throughout in
dozens of suspected kidnappers.

371
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,460
They would just gunned down.

372
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:05,971
Finally,

373
00:17:05,971 --> 00:17:07,290
they gave in and Pablo,

374
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,710
his old man was released with
no ransom ever being paid.

375
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,863
Okay.

376
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,650
In the midst of the carnage
over his father's kidnapping,

377
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,060
Pablo returned to Columbia.

378
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,170
He was now determined to take on the
state with everything that he had around

379
00:17:29,171 --> 00:17:29,680
Medina.

380
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,560
He was untouchable having
bought off every official.

381
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,460
This allows him,

382
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:36,700
although being the most wanted man in
the country to move around the town

383
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:37,330
freely.

384
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,260
Public vengeful focus during the mid
eighties was squarely centered on the

385
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:41,950
judiciary,

386
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:45,640
especially judges who supported the
extradition treaty with the U s.

387
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,870
During this time,

388
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,060
more than 30 judges were shot dead.

389
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,780
Then in November of 1985 the gorilla grip,

390
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:54,570
I'm 19 having been paid
$1 million by Pavlo,

391
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:59,460
stormed the palace of justice and
how's the entire supreme court hostage.

392
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,360
They demanded that the government
renounced the extradition treaty in the

393
00:18:03,361 --> 00:18:04,230
resulting siege.

394
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,520
11 of the 24 justices along with
40 of the rebels were killed.

395
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,500
By the beginning of 1988 killings were
being reported on an almost daily basis.

396
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,530
Martial law was declared to
around the state from toppling.

397
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:21,840
On August the 18th 1989 pueblos kill
squads gun down both the front running

398
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:22,980
presidential candidates,

399
00:18:22,981 --> 00:18:23,814
Luis Galen,

400
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,560
and say state police chief.

401
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,090
In the following four months,

402
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,780
the Colombian government apprehended
and sent more than 20 suspected drug

403
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:34,940
traffickers to the United States to stand
trial and national police units with

404
00:18:34,941 --> 00:18:38,340
stations to Metta Une
specifically to hunt down Pablo.

405
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,290
Within the first month,

406
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:43,980
30 of the 200 men station
there had been killed.

407
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,150
Pablo was evading as governments
and inflicting enormous casualties,

408
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,490
but he was a man constantly on the run.

409
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,500
He always stayed a step
ahead of his pursuers,

410
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,920
but he was growing tired of the
constant relocations that were needed.

411
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,560
Eventually he was driven to negotiate.

412
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,110
Pablo agreed to put an end to all the
violence to stop all criminal activity and

413
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,020
hand himself in.

414
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,003
In exchange,

415
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,910
he demands it preferential treatments in
a prison of his choosing and a reduced

416
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:09,773
settlement.

417
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,560
The government had already revoked the
extradition treaty to the U s with its

418
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:15,120
1991 constitution,

419
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,170
so he didn't have to worry about being
sent to America and it's with all of

420
00:19:19,171 --> 00:19:19,590
that.

421
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:22,410
Pablo was duly arrested and duty tried.

422
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:26,940
He began his sentence as low catty
drought prison in June of 1991 but this,

423
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,371
well,

424
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:29,010
it was like no other prison on earth.

425
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,680
If featured a football
pitch to QC and a bar,

426
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:34,410
all of the prison guards
were pub Lowe's employees.

427
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,680
The prison cells were more like hotel
suites and the food that Pablo and his

428
00:19:37,681 --> 00:19:38,420
fellow inmates.

429
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:42,510
It was prepared by chefs who were
brought in from the finest restaurants.

430
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:43,500
But after a few months,

431
00:19:43,501 --> 00:19:46,950
accounts began to reach official channels
that Pablo was continuing to pursue

432
00:19:46,951 --> 00:19:48,690
his criminal activities from the prison.

433
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,410
This was a violation of the surrender
agreements and to move as were put in

434
00:19:52,411 --> 00:19:55,590
place to sees him and move
him to a regular prison.

435
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,700
Pablos connections enabled him to get a
wind of the plan and he escaped before

436
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:00,534
authorities.

437
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,453
It get to him,

438
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,343
okay,

439
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,660
Pablo is back on,

440
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,650
but now the u s and Colombian authorities
were joins buying a vigilante group

441
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,240
known as the Los Padres,

442
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,510
which stood for people
persecuted by Pablo Escobar.

443
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,600
Last pap has carried
out a ruthless campaign,

444
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:28,420
killing as many as 300 people who were
connected to Pablo and disorganization.

445
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,430
Following his escape.

446
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,200
Public was constantly on the run.

447
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,430
Most of his closest associates were dad
and his organization was totally falling

448
00:20:35,431 --> 00:20:36,030
apart.

449
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,070
He was spending nights
sleeping in the jungle,

450
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,980
afraid to speak on the radio
or even to answer the phone.

451
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:41,431
Finally,

452
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,320
they fake caught up with Pablo Escobar.

453
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,020
On December the second 1993 members of
a Colombian search bloc team attracted

454
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,330
down to her house in Los Olivos
in marine via radio intercepts.

455
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,540
The search bloc team smashed through the
heavy steel door with a sledgehammer,

456
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:57,970
whereupon six of them
rushed into the house.

457
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,660
It was then the shooting started with
Pablo in the house was his most loyal

458
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,130
bodyguard known as Lehman.

459
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,010
They both bolted from the front room
and made their way up into the roof.

460
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,280
The six search bloc members
along with others outside port,

461
00:21:09,281 --> 00:21:11,650
a massive barrage of
gunfire at their targets.

462
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,800
Lemon was hit several times in the
back and tumbled to the ground below.

463
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,630
Then Pablo went down.

464
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,700
He was struck several
times in the leg and torso,

465
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,570
but the fatal shot penetrated his
skull on confirming his targets.

466
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,980
The leader of the operation
spoke excitedly into his
radio viva like Columbia.

467
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,900
We have just killed Pablo Escobar,

468
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,580
but had they,

469
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:33,760
Pablo had always told his
family that if cornered,

470
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,940
he would commit suicide by
placing a bullet in his skull.

471
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,140
Many people believe that he did so one
smaller escaping the clutches of the

472
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,820
Colombian authorities.
