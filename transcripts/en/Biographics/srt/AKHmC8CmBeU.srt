1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,290
Known as the father of modern fantasy
is epic tales of legends and Law.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,640
I've been enjoyed by millions of people
all over the worlds devoured and popular

3
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:11,370
books and adapted for
Hollywood blockbuster films.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,900
Unbelievably Bright.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,000
He was a distinguished
university professor,

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,630
poet,

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,291
historian,

8
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:17,071
and experts,

9
00:00:17,071 --> 00:00:18,510
linguist as a trials.

10
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,720
He even made up his own
languages for pure fun.

11
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,270
He gave us a complex
and fence for creatures,

12
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:25,320
including hobbits,

13
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,770
orcs and elves sat in a
prehistoric middle laugh.

14
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,390
Some theorize that is made up.

15
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:34,800
Worlds are symbolic of his country's
past power struggles influenced by his

16
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:39,801
devout Roman Catholic faith or simply
the genesis of his personal experiences.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,711
In any case,

18
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:45,240
there is no denying his
glorious imagination and his
rightful place amongst the

19
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:47,220
greatest writers of all time,

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:50,280
but who was the creator of the
hobbies and the Lord of the Rings?

21
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:50,641
Well,

22
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:51,930
today on biographics,

23
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:55,080
we explore the life of Jane are talking.

24
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,503
Yeah.

25
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:04,860
Before

26
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,300
bank clerk after talking and Mabel
Suffield welcomes their son into the world

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,910
via English couple moved to South Africa.

28
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,440
Here,

29
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,770
Alpha had high hopes of advancing his
career and providing a comfortable life

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,880
for their budding family.

31
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,050
John Ronald rule known as Ronald to most
was born in Bloemfontein South Africa

32
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:25,610
on January the third 1892 not
long after another son Hillary.

33
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:26,850
He was born competing,

34
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,760
the talking family,

35
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:29,370
talking his childhood in Africa.

36
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:33,270
It was cut short when his mother decided
the boys would be better educators and

37
00:01:33,271 --> 00:01:36,690
then native England's at the age of
three Talkin and his mother and younger

38
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:38,130
brother left for their homelands.

39
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,760
Well,

40
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,980
Arthur stayed behind
to settle the business.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,100
He was planning to join them but never
meters falling ill and dying of these

42
00:01:45,101 --> 00:01:46,350
severe brain hemorrhage,

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,450
a complication of rheumatic fever on
February the 15th 1896 at the time the

44
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:55,290
spread of disease and contagions were
fears and to travel took many weeks if not

45
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:56,160
months off.

46
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,280
His body was laid to rest
without his family by his side.

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,310
Having spent just a small fraction
of his early years in Africa,

48
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,710
talking had very few
memories from that time.

49
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
However one tail persists,

50
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,870
but the facts remain uncertain
according to this story.

51
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:14,871
The then toddler talking stumbles upon
and was bit by a baboon spider type of

52
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:16,440
tarantula in the garden.

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,160
Talking,

54
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,491
ran,

55
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,031
screaming,

56
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:21,600
and it isn't as immediately snatched him
up and just suck the venom out from the

57
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,170
wound.

58
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,610
Talking later said he could remember a
hot day and running and fair through long

59
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,301
dead grass,

60
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,340
but the memory of the tarantula itself,

61
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:33,780
faders and he sad that the incidents
left him with no special dislike of

62
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,590
spiders.

63
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,970
Still fans and armchair psychologists
to like speculate whether the tarantula

64
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:43,971
influenced the presence of man eating
spiders talkings later fictional works

65
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:47,280
well back in England's Mabel in the
boys settled with family in the West

66
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:49,080
Midlands first and King Seeth Ethan.

67
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,910
Then in cell hole on one hands,

68
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,650
and especially in the city of Birmingham,

69
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,180
the West Midlands was urban,

70
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,530
dark and industrial.

71
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,110
On the other hand,

72
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,110
it was the idyllic English countryside
with lush green trees and a corn mill in

73
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:05,710
the rural hamlet of [inaudible] between
the ages of four and eight talking lived

74
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:07,840
across the street and within 300 yards.

75
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:10,420
If the sat whole mill and Mosley bog,

76
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:13,870
he spends many hours that playing with
his younger brother and being chased by

77
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,704
the Miller's son,

78
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,640
whom the boy is nicknamed the white.

79
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,320
Oh,

80
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,930
the Shi'a Tompkins imaginary land
of hobbits was inspired myself.

81
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,060
A hole in the hobbit.

82
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,870
He writes of Bilbo Baggins running as
fast as his fairy feet could carry him

83
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:30,550
down the lane past the great mill across
the water and then on for a mile or

84
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,570
more tokens.

85
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,890
Mother homeschooled the boys at first
to teaching the young Tolkien botany ans

86
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,070
the basics of Latin talking could read
fluently by the age of four and to write

87
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:42,100
soon after he loved drawing
landscapes and trees,

88
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,250
but his favorite studies where
those involving languages.

89
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,980
Later he would attend King
Edward's school in Birmingham,

90
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,480
which proved to be the perfect breeding
ground for the boys is natural curiosity

91
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,220
and developments of linguistics.

92
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
Talking was an exceptional student.

93
00:03:55,841 --> 00:04:00,250
He was capable of easily mastering ancient
and modern languages including Greek,

94
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:00,701
Latin,

95
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:01,210
Spanish,

96
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,810
old English,

97
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,890
old Norse,

98
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:02,891
Gothic,

99
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,940
and finish the boy.

100
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,060
He made up his own languages
including early variations of elvish.

101
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,580
Once featured in his
writings asking Edwards,

102
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,910
he made a number of close friends
and formed a semi secret society.

103
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,990
Let's enjoyed drinking tea and
critiquing each other's literary works.

104
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,540
They called themselves TC bs,

105
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:23,200
which stood for the tea
club Barrovian society.

106
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,690
Despite the earlier loss of his father.

107
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:29,530
Life of the [inaudible] was generally
happy until two events altered the course

108
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,364
of his life.

109
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,940
In 1900 his mother decided to
convert to the Catholic faith,

110
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,050
this ball to move left and Mabel and her
son's estranged from both sides of the

111
00:04:38,051 --> 00:04:39,410
family and in the fall.

112
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:41,650
Laos talking experienced isolation,

113
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,580
loneliness,

114
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,413
and poverty.

115
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,350
Following his acceptance and some Catholic
church talking remained devout in his

116
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,880
faith for the rest of his life.

117
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,300
He has also been credited with being
partly responsible for bringing another

118
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,740
famous writer and friends.

119
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,930
Cs Lewis spect,

120
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,773
Christianity.

121
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,350
Tragedy.

122
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:00,880
Then struck talking again in 1984 when
his mother was diagnosed with diabetes.

123
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,010
A sure death sentence in that time,

124
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,671
sadly,

125
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,050
Mable died in the same year on November
the 14th talking was 12 at the time.

126
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,810
Fortunately for Tolkien
and his brother Hillary,

127
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,010
that Catholic priest,

128
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:16,180
Father Francis Morgan stepped in and it
became their guardian and made sure the

129
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:19,840
boys received everything they needed
both materially and spiritually.

130
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:24,761
Talking mess.

131
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:29,200
His eventual bright brass when he was
16 and she was 19 they were both orphans

132
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,800
and lodges at a boarding house run
by a woman named Mrs. Faulkner,

133
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,880
the two group funds of each other and
a friendship developed and then as it

134
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:37,870
happens with teenagers,

135
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,880
the patter came too
close for Father Francis.

136
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,540
His liking.

137
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:44,350
He was horrified as ward was courting
a Protestant women and to believe the

138
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:48,960
relationship was a distraction from
talking school work for other Francis for

139
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:49,030
Bates,

140
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,080
talking to see your corresponded
with Edith until he was 21 this was a

141
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:54,580
devastating blow to talking,

142
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,200
but he obeyed the order.

143
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,530
When his birthday approached,

144
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,600
he wrote to his love and
his proposed marriage.

145
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,370
Her reply was heartbreaking,

146
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,110
but offered a glimmer of hope.

147
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,760
She was engaged to another man,

148
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,653
but his latter,

149
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,800
NATO reconsider.

150
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,540
Edith agreed to meet talking on January
the eighth 1913 at the train station in

151
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,140
Shelton.

152
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,960
They walked and talked for
hours and Edith accepted tokens,

153
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,860
marriage proposal,

154
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,720
breaking off her prior engagements.

155
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,840
You just converted to Catholicism and
the couple married on March the 22nd 1916

156
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,780
[inaudible] was 24 years olds and a few
months shy of deploying to the western

157
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:27,540
front in all.

158
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,310
That's it to his son,

159
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:28,671
Michael.

160
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,870
Years later talking expressed admiration
for his wife's willingness to marry a

161
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,010
man with new job.

162
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,820
There's more money and to know prospects
except the likelihood of being killed

163
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,840
in the great war.

164
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,350
Talking was a true romantic
and Edith was his muse.

165
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,333
He wrote to her,

166
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:43,491
oh,

167
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:47,900
how was raven a skin clear her eyes
brighter than you have seen them and she

168
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:50,420
could sing and dance talking.

169
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:54,470
We're so mad for if he
created the fictional power
of star crossed lovers based

170
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,180
on their romance Lithion daughter.

171
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:59,480
If the Alvin King of Dory
F and Barron a mortal man,

172
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,740
they fall for each other.

173
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:04,040
When baron discovers Lithion
singing and dancing and a glade.

174
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,490
Yet that love can never be
since baron is destined to die.

175
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,330
Alas,

176
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,230
disapproving father,

177
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,850
the King Sends Darren on the task.

178
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:13,530
He knows the mat and cannot
complete the full story of Leith.

179
00:07:13,531 --> 00:07:16,490
Ian and baron was left unfinished
during [inaudible] lifetime,

180
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,030
but it served an important backstory
and the hobbit talking son Christopher

181
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,030
later published Lithion and
baron is a chapter in the saga,

182
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,840
the Silmarillion Edith and Toki and
enjoyed a long and happy marriage to each

183
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,280
other and they had four children,

184
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,060
John Francis,

185
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:29,391
Micheal,

186
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:29,900
Hillary,

187
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,351
Christopher,

188
00:07:30,351 --> 00:07:30,830
John,

189
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,610
and Priscilla.

190
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,030
Marianne [inaudible] was a devoted
father and his loved his children,

191
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:39,860
often making up funds for stories for
them from 1920 to 1942 at Christmas time,

192
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,170
talking illustrated
letters to his children,

193
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,430
introducing new characters
such as the north polar bear,

194
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,910
snow man and others.

195
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,410
Three years after his death,

196
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,010
these intimate stories were published
as letters from Father Christmas by the

197
00:07:52,011 --> 00:07:52,880
Tolkien estate

198
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,930
believing he was in his own words,

199
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,710
a young man with too much imagination
and little physical courage.

200
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:06,460
Talking did not rush to join the
British military when war broke out.

201
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,030
Instead,

202
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,440
he returned to Oxford where
he had achieved a first
class degree in June of 1915

203
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,490
Tolkien was busy working on poems and
his invented languages at this time.

204
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,271
Eventually though,

205
00:08:16,271 --> 00:08:20,720
talking enlisted as a second leftenant
in the Lancashire Fusiliers and was sent

206
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,250
to active duty on the western front just
in time for the battle of the Somme,

207
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,230
also known as the Somme offensive.

208
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,490
The Battle of the Somme remains one
of the bloodiest military battles in

209
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,120
history.

210
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,510
It lasted for long months
and on the first day alone,

211
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:39,010
British troops suffered over
57,000 casualties in total.

212
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,600
Over a million men lost their lives,

213
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:45,220
including 420,000 British soldiers
fighting in the great war,

214
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:49,100
talking witness the horrors of trench
fighting and lived in deplorable and

215
00:08:49,101 --> 00:08:50,260
sanitary conditions.

216
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,280
It was hell on earth for Tolkien and his
comrades who stood by as their friends

217
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,860
suffered and died them.

218
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,330
They spend their days and nights with
little relief and endured infestations of

219
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,220
lice that feasted on their flash.

220
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,030
As a result,

221
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,130
talking came down with trench fever,

222
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,880
a major medical problem of world war
one so severe with a licensed captain

223
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,050
staying with talking's units.

224
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,620
Later recalls we dos down for the night
in the hopes of getting some sleep,

225
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,550
but it was not to be,

226
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,490
we no sooner lay down than
hordes of lice got up,

227
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,210
so we went round in the medical officer
who was also in the dog house with this

228
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:25,140
equipment and t gave us some ointments
which he assured us would keep the little

229
00:09:25,141 --> 00:09:25,974
bricks away.

230
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,270
We anointed it ourselves all over with
the stuff and to gain lay down in great

231
00:09:30,271 --> 00:09:30,780
hope,

232
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,480
but it was not to be because
instead of discouraging them,

233
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:38,540
it seems to act like a kind of hoarder
of the little beggars went at their feast

234
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,780
with renewed vigor,

235
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,100
sick and is unable to fight.

236
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,130
He's talking left the battle front to
recover in a Birmingham Hospital in

237
00:09:44,131 --> 00:09:49,131
November of 1916 through 1917 and 1918
talking had bouts of the illness and he

238
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:54,330
spent time in remission doing service at
home and at various camps talking most

239
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:57,900
likely escaped death on the battlefronts
precisely because he became ill,

240
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,360
sadly all but one of his close friends,

241
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:04,200
including those from the tcbs
perished in the war as a writer.

242
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,100
This tragedy of loss and firsthand
experience in battle provided.

243
00:10:08,101 --> 00:10:11,430
Talking with a keen sense of
awareness from the unpublished,

244
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:12,960
the book of loss tails talking,

245
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:17,280
writes in huts full of blasphemy and
smart or by candle light and bell tense,

246
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,030
even some down in dug outs
on the shelf in the hobbits,

247
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,350
the battle of the five armies.

248
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:26,640
It's thought to draw upon talkings
wartime experiences as well as the dead

249
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:29,700
marshes and black gauge of
mortar in the Lord of the rings.

250
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,760
On November the 11th 1918
the armistice was signed,

251
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,970
which marks the end of World War One.

252
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,940
Duncan was appointed
assistant lexicographer Ron,

253
00:10:41,941 --> 00:10:42,960
the new English dictionary,

254
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:46,920
also known as the Oxford
English dictionary in 1918
but stayed on the job for

255
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:47,790
only a short while.

256
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,820
In the summer of 1920 he accepted a
post as a reader with the University of

257
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,070
Leeds Leeds.

258
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,230
He taught and collaborated
with other authors,

259
00:10:55,231 --> 00:10:57,150
continued writing the book of loss tails,

260
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,500
constructed languages,

261
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,770
and founded reading and social
clubs like the Viking club.

262
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,700
This was an undergraduate club for
Stevens who had an affinity for old Norse

263
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,310
Sagas and drinking.

264
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:06,810
Yeah.

265
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,320
In 1925 talking that finally
received his professorship at Oxford.

266
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,600
The Rawlinson man's
Bosworth professorship,

267
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,610
Anglo Saxon talking,

268
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:18,750
was right at home in academia and fit in
remarkably well with the predominantly

269
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:19,590
male culture.

270
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,880
He reveled in the lectures,

271
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:24,630
research and exchange of ideas with
students and fellow professors.

272
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,590
Talking did not publish many scholarly
articles yet he was extremely

273
00:11:28,591 --> 00:11:29,424
influential.

274
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,090
One lecture worth mentioning altered
the modern study of the old English epic

275
00:11:33,091 --> 00:11:33,421
tale,

276
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:37,380
Baerwolf and twist first
delivered in 1936 in Baerwolf,

277
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:40,410
the monsters and the critics
talking argued the monsters,

278
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:40,861
Grendel,

279
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:42,210
Grendel's mother and the Dragon,

280
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,730
or not merely extraneous to the narrative,

281
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,470
but should be a focus of study.

282
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,580
Talking believed critics,

283
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,970
but too much emphasis on the
historical elements of the tail.

284
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,280
Instead of looking at it
as a work of art as Oxford,

285
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,600
talking to friends and colleagues,

286
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,231
cs Lewis,

287
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:58,060
best known for his fantasy series,

288
00:11:58,061 --> 00:11:59,350
the chronicles of Narnia,

289
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,250
the two men bonded over their shared
love of mythology and it's began meeting

290
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:04,600
regularly for a glass,

291
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,320
a joke,

292
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,210
and to criticize each other's poetry.

293
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,280
The meetings were so enjoyable and useful,

294
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,570
they invited others to join.

295
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,730
The informal group known as the inklings,

296
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,540
eventually grew to 19 members and to
the mass once a week late at night,

297
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,260
sometimes not wrapping up until two or
three o'clock in the morning as well as

298
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:24,100
the practice talking shared manuscripts
of works in progress with the inklings

299
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:26,320
and received energetic
feedback from the group.

300
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,520
Among other ratings.

301
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:30,490
Talking brought original poetry
sections from the Hobbit,

302
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:35,080
excerpts from the notion club papers
and each new chapter of the Lord of the

303
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:35,650
rings.

304
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:38,890
There is little evidence to support the
suggestion by some that the men had a

305
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,620
more spiritual purpose to them.

306
00:12:40,621 --> 00:12:41,454
Meetings,

307
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,400
the inklings continued to
meet regularly for 19 years.

308
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,140
Together with talking and Louis,

309
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,860
some of the more distinguished members
of the infant's included Neville

310
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:50,861
Cockatiel,

311
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:51,730
Hugo Dyson,

312
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,040
Owen Barfield and Charles Williams.

313
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,690
In 1945 talking changed as chair at
Oxford do the Merton professorship of

314
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,040
English language and literature.

315
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,670
He held this position until
his retirement in 1959

316
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,950
one hot summer day in 1928 professor
talking was grading exam papers,

317
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:13,990
which he described as soldiers drying.

318
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:18,460
He came upon a blank page and without
thought wrote down in a hole in the

319
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,030
ground.

320
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,080
They lived a Hobbit,

321
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,561
us,

322
00:13:20,561 --> 00:13:22,930
what was a hobbit and why
did it live in the grounds?

323
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,830
Well talking,

324
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,810
you need to define the
answers to these questions.

325
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,763
He said later,

326
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,780
names always generate a story.

327
00:13:28,781 --> 00:13:32,260
In my mind I thought I'd better
find out what hobbits were like.

328
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:33,160
Then injury,

329
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,000
talking fashion,

330
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,650
the dive headlong into the creative
process and concocted a tale to tell his

331
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,170
younger children and share
amongst the inklings.

332
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,160
In 1936 and incomplete copy of the
hobbit wound up in Susan diagonals,

333
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,230
hands and employee of the publishing firm,

334
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:47,891
George Allen,

335
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:49,750
and when recognizing the stories,

336
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:53,500
potential dagnall convinced talking
to finish it and complete it,

337
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,210
she presented it to her boss.

338
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,140
He then tested it out on his 10 year
old son who gave us a raving review.

339
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,700
Ours was published one year later in
1937 and it was an immediate test.

340
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,270
In fact,

341
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,320
it was so successful that the publisher
asked Toking if he has any similar

342
00:14:08,321 --> 00:14:09,490
stories today.

343
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,870
Since the first publication,

344
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:15,340
the hobbit has sold more than 100 million
copies around the wells and has been

345
00:14:15,341 --> 00:14:18,130
translated in over 50 languages.

346
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,091
So you might be wondering,

347
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:19,241
well,

348
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:20,680
what makes the hobbits so endearing?

349
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,311
For one thing,

350
00:14:21,311 --> 00:14:23,260
it lacks female characters and it is not,

351
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,270
nor has it ever been politically correct.

352
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,740
It is also a very long tail with poetry
and unlike other children's fiction,

353
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,450
does not have a central child figure for
whom young readers can easily identify

354
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:34,930
with.

355
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,230
Although the protagonist Bilbo
Baggins is only a little hobbit,

356
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:40,570
so he does kind of acts
like a surrogate child.

357
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,110
Talkings colorful descriptions of middle
earth and it's complex characters,

358
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:44,681
goblins,

359
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:45,101
elves,

360
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:45,491
orcs,

361
00:14:45,491 --> 00:14:45,941
wizards,

362
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:46,541
dragons,

363
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:47,500
and hobbits of course,

364
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,770
are richly portrayed and for all the
fantasy writers you came after talking

365
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,620
hardly any can say their wells were not,

366
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,760
at least in part,

367
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,320
influenced by the hobbits.

368
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,300
But what set the story apart is the depth
of emotion and moral courage talking

369
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,100
weaves into his heroic fiction.

370
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,290
There are examples of this
throughout the Hobbit,

371
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,300
including the death of Dwarf leader,

372
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:08,870
Thorin,

373
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,703
Okin shields.

374
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,680
There's also build those internal
struggle to do what's right,

375
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:16,370
betraying his friends while they tried
to reclaim the lonely mounds in from

376
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:16,821
Smok,

377
00:15:16,821 --> 00:15:20,930
the dragon bill by fields and obsessive
greed has overtaken Thorin and when

378
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,990
builder finds the Arkenstone
the greatest treasure of all,

379
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,920
he decides to first hide it and then
give it to his friends procedures to be

380
00:15:27,921 --> 00:15:30,080
used as a bargaining chip in the ends.

381
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,540
Bilbo exposes himself and
confesses because after all,

382
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,640
they are friends.

383
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,680
After talking's publication
of the hobbyist,

384
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,850
he presented portions of the Silmarillion
including incomplete stories of

385
00:15:40,851 --> 00:15:44,660
Lithion and baron to Stanley and
when hoping for a warm reception,

386
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,200
but his reader Phelps the stories
when not commercially publishable,

387
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,270
they simply contains too much poetry.

388
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,010
Talking was disappointed of the news,

389
00:15:52,011 --> 00:15:56,000
but soon found himself busy writing the
sequel to the hobbyist talkings opus.

390
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,010
What would become the Lord of the rings?

391
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,780
This was first published in three parts,

392
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:00,710
the fellowship of the ring,

393
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:01,371
the two towers,

394
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:06,371
and the return of the king between 1954
and 1955 it took him over a decade to

395
00:16:07,011 --> 00:16:09,890
write these books and wind
son who was by now an adult,

396
00:16:09,891 --> 00:16:13,580
was heavily involved in pushing a
temperamental talking to finish the books,

397
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,780
thinking it would be a
relatively unimpressive
release and they lost the from

398
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,690
the publishers grossly
underestimated the Lord of the rings.

399
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,523
Public Appeal,

400
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:25,280
true is had mixed reviews from damning
to glowing and everything in between.

401
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:28,010
The BBC adapted it into
12 condensed episodes,

402
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,870
elevating its popularity further.

403
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:33,350
Then in the mid 1960s a pirated
paperback version was released,

404
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,630
which caught the attention
of American readers,

405
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:39,740
sort of cults then developed based on
the new founds popularity of fantasy

406
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:42,350
literature and talking
was made a rich man.

407
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,910
He was not entirely happy though,

408
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,080
even if he was flatus,

409
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,790
partly because rumors circulators of
party going culture readers ingesting LSD

410
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,070
and reading the Lord of the rings and
indeed some overzealous fans who talking

411
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,430
referred to as lunatics.

412
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,250
We're calling his home and demanding
to know if Frodo has succeeded as his

413
00:16:59,251 --> 00:16:59,930
quest,

414
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:02,780
the hobbies and the Lord of the rings
certainly receive all the glory,

415
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:06,920
but talking authored a number of other
articles and essays during his lifetime,

416
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:09,530
including the monsters and
the critics and other essays.

417
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,910
One middle earth related work,

418
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:14,690
the adventures of Tom Bombadil editions
and translations of Middle English works

419
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,450
such as the [inaudible],

420
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,850
so gay when answer or Feo
and the pal and stories,

421
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:20,420
the Emram,

422
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,500
the homecoming of band,

423
00:17:21,501 --> 00:17:22,050
Roth band,

424
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,540
Roth's son and stories,

425
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,170
the Emram,

426
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,640
the layer of outro and Itron Pharma
Giles of Ham leaf by Niggle and Smith of

427
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:30,410
which a major following his death,

428
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,820
the letters from Father Christmas were
released by the Talkeetna state and later

429
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,870
son Christopher saw to edge that his
father Silmarillion and a number of other

430
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:42,690
incomplete writings under the title
of unfinished tales of Numa norm.

431
00:17:42,691 --> 00:17:46,940
Men's middle f published after his
retirement from Oxford talky and moved to

432
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:47,510
Bournemouth.

433
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:50,730
And on November the 29th
71 the love of his life.

434
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,760
Edith died nearly two years
later on September the
second 1973 talking followed.

435
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,460
There's a final testament to their
love and at talking's instruction,

436
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,580
they were buried in a single
grave on their tombstone.

437
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,380
Baron is engraved under
his name and Lithion.

438
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,860
IPS under Edith

439
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,770
talking shall remain a celebrated literary
figure through the ages as his life

440
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,840
work continues to inspire the
fantasy genre around the world.

441
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:21,950
His characters and places have become
the namesake of various street names,

442
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:22,820
companies,

443
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,481
mountains,

444
00:18:23,481 --> 00:18:24,860
pants and objects.

445
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:29,210
There are even asteroids named after
Bilbo Baggins and talking himself in

446
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:33,290
England that all seven blue plaques
that commemorates places associated with

447
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,040
talking,

448
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:38,390
talking was made a commander of the
British empire by Queen Elizabeth in 1972

449
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:41,090
and z holds a number of other
achievements and awards,

450
00:18:41,091 --> 00:18:45,080
including an honorary degree from the
National University of Ireland and the

University of Legion 1954 and the Lucas
award for the best fantasy novel for the

452
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:52,860
Silmarillion in 1978 and the two
thousands talking ranked on bbcs greatest

453
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,540
Britain's list and the Lord of the rings
was the Uks best love novel in 2003 and

454
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,670
his ranks among the hundred greatest
British novels in 2015 Tolkien was placed

455
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:06,320
sixth on the list of the
50 greatest British writers

Times in 2008 in 2009 he was listed as

457
00:19:11,721 --> 00:19:16,721
Forbes from 2001 to 2003 new line cinema
release the Lord of the rings as a

458
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,590
trilogy directed by Peter Jackson.

459
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,830
The series was extremely successful and
won numerous Oscar's from 2012 to 2014

460
00:19:24,741 --> 00:19:27,200
Warner brothers and new line
cinema released the Hobbit,

461
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,200
a series of three films
based on the Hobbit book,

462
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,030
the first in 2012 the Hobbit,

463
00:19:32,031 --> 00:19:33,170
an unexpected journey.

464
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:37,670
The second in 2013 the hobbit to the
desolation of Smaug ans the final

465
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:40,160
installment in 2014 the Hobbit,

466
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:44,450
the battle of the five armies talkings
middle earth is surely the gift that

467
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:49,130
keeps on giving and it is quite amazing
considering he wrote it all in his spare

468
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,023
time.

469
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,610
So I really hope you enjoyed
that episode of biographics.

470
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,451
