1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,770
He sees you when you were sleeping.

2
00:00:01,771 --> 00:00:03,270
He knows when you're awake.

3
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,700
He knows when you've been bad or good,

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:07,920
so be good for goodness sake.

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:09,450
If you live in the western world,

6
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:14,451
you already know this line from Santa
Claus is coming to town by Harry Connick

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:14,821
Jr.

8
00:00:14,821 --> 00:00:17,880
We've all heard the songs
and seeing the movies,

9
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:22,881
but do you may not know the true story
behind the legend of the man who can fly

10
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:25,530
around the world in just a single night?

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,091
Any mind?

12
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:26,761
They'll be wondering,

13
00:00:26,761 --> 00:00:30,510
why am I wearing a hat that is not a
Santa Claus hat and that is because for

14
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:32,040
this very special Christmas video,

15
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:33,630
I wanted to get a Santa Claus hat,

16
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:37,710
but apparently I have a giant head and
this Christmas tree house was the only

17
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:38,580
thing that would fit me.

18
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm going to take this off and we're
going to get on with today's video.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,210
Nicholas of Bari was born in the
fourth century in the town of Myra,

20
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,470
located in Asia Minor.

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,570
This is now modern day Turkey.

22
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,650
His parents were wealthy Christians who
had trouble conceiving a child for many

23
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:06,830
years.

24
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,070
They prayed to God every day to
have a child if their very own,

25
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:13,580
and as soon as they finally
conceived and gave birth to a son,

26
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,590
they saw it as Trudy America.

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,120
Sadly Nicholas's parents,

28
00:01:17,121 --> 00:01:20,680
they would die of an epidemic that spread
throughout the city of my relieving

29
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,220
him to become a young orphan.

30
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,440
He was raised by his uncle,

31
00:01:23,441 --> 00:01:24,650
who was the bishop of Myra,

32
00:01:24,651 --> 00:01:26,120
who would never had children of his own.

33
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,860
He was very proud of his nephew,

34
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:30,830
especially when he grew up to
be a very well behaved boy.

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,100
His uncle apparently announced to everyone
in the church that he had a vision

36
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:37,010
that his nephew would grow up
to bring joy to many people.

37
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,210
When Nicholas grew up,

38
00:01:38,211 --> 00:01:40,580
his uncle's prophecy
actually did come true.

39
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,300
He was always kind to others and twin
town of his way to help people as an

40
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:44,601
orphan.

41
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:48,200
Nicholas had a special place in his heart
for children and he would often help

42
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:49,850
them make handmade toys to play with.

43
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,620
Even though he was from a wealthy family,

44
00:01:51,621 --> 00:01:55,280
he still had a lot of sympathy for the
poor and he wanted to do whatever he

45
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,060
could to help.

46
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,730
There was a man in the town who
had three beautiful daughters,

47
00:01:58,731 --> 00:02:01,610
but he was so poor he
could not pay for a dowery.

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,850
This meant that his daughters could not
get married and so they would have to be

49
00:02:04,851 --> 00:02:08,090
sold into slavery because the father
could not afford to support them.

50
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,530
Nicholas wanted to help,

51
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:13,790
but he did not want to hurt the father's
pride by offering a donation face to

52
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,240
face,

53
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,160
so he dropped a bag of
gold down the chimney,

54
00:02:16,161 --> 00:02:19,070
which lands in their stockings
that were hanging up to dry.

55
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,480
The father and his daughters,

56
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:21,210
they jumped for joy,

57
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,080
believing that God had finally
answered their prayers.

58
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,590
He was finally able to pay for the dowery
and all his daughter went on to get

59
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:28,280
married.

60
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,520
Nicholas came back to do this again
for the two younger daughters,

61
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:33,710
which is when he was caught in the acts.

62
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:37,220
Everyone knew this gold wasn't just
appearing out of thin air and people began

63
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:38,420
to whisper around town.

64
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:42,080
About a young Nicholas and his
kind heart and his generosity.

65
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:45,800
Nicholas was a very simple person who
didn't need a lot to be happy and the

66
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:47,270
money didn't mean much to him,

67
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:51,110
but he knew that his donations could
be life changing for other families and

68
00:02:51,111 --> 00:02:51,650
Myra,

69
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,100
he just sent me did to continue paying
attention to people who needed the most

70
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:59,180
help in the city and he would always
anonymously give away his inheritance,

71
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,630
have a people off to this story
spread around town people again,

72
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:02,910
Z,

73
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:06,880
leave that stockings and shoes by the
fireplace in hopes that they would receive

74
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:08,290
gold from Nicholas as well.

75
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,101
Soon Office of this,

76
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,610
people throughout the city of Myra were
receiving anonymous presence that would

77
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,410
mysteriously appear in their homes.

78
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,540
This box has spirit of giving a neighbors.

79
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,890
We're now helping out one another in
that time of need without fear of hurting

80
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:21,724
that pride.

81
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,650
Anytime an anonymous gift would show up,

82
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,150
they designed it to thank Nicholas.

83
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,050
Even if he wasn't the ones who
actually deliver every single present.

84
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,410
People begin to remove that since this
man seemed to be able to be in many

85
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,221
places at once,

86
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,650
he was more than just
a devout Christian men.

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,260
They believed that he had been
blessed with magical powers.

88
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,100
Now he truly did begins you travel across
Turkey and he reached a point where he

89
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:44,140
had given away all of
his earthly possessions,

90
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:45,850
which was totally fine with him.

91
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,020
He at that point,

92
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,730
is devoted his life to becoming a monk.

93
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,860
We know with absolute
certainty that Nicholas truly
was a real person because he

94
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:55,310
grew up to take over his uncle,

95
00:03:55,311 --> 00:03:58,000
his position as the next bishop of Myra.

96
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,330
There are records of his participation
in the first council of Nicea,

97
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,870
including his outspoken outrage over
the corruption that he saw within the

98
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,830
Catholic church.

99
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,880
In one story,

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,020
Nicholas witnessed a horrific scene where
children had been kidnapped since he

101
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,190
was then able to rescue them.

102
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,310
He was seen as such a hoodie man
that he was the nature canonized,

103
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,600
a Saint Nicholas,

104
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,100
the patron saint of children,

105
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:19,870
and surprisingly sailors.

106
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,520
That's right,

107
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,050
Saint Nick.

108
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:21,761
I love to travel.

109
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,594
Even back then.

110
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,220
He sailed along the coast of Asia.

111
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:27,070
Minor ins dreamed of
seeing the entire planet,

112
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,250
so he has to come sailors,

113
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,010
which continue to pray to some Nicholas
to help them whenever they were on a

114
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,890
long voyage.

115
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,190
Legend has it that one day
Turkish sailors were out at sea.

116
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,310
The winds and waves were so strong that
the men were afraid that the boat would

117
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,144
capsize.

118
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,690
They prayed to Saint Nicholas for
help and he appeared before them.

119
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:45,010
With his arms outstretched.

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,910
He was able to control the weather and
it's calm the ocean and the sailors made

121
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:49,744
it home safely.

122
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,540
This was just one of the many examples.

123
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:56,080
If the stories of Nick's
extraordinary magical powers,

124
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,340
and it just may be a good explanation
of how center managers to travel in his

125
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,590
sleigh through all kinds of weather,

126
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,460
the fantastical stories of Sedna,

127
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,120
this loss did for longer
than just one lifetime.

128
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,270
Historically didn't need to go
on for another thousand years.

129
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,990
It would seem that the magic behind
his generosity was so inspiring and

130
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:14,590
powerful.

131
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,700
It was enough to keep them alive in the
hearts of mankind for generations to

132
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:19,534
come.

133
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,340
From the fourth to the 16th centuries,

134
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,090
Nicholas became one of the
most popular Catholic scenes.

135
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,690
People continue to pray to him,

136
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,820
wishing for his help
in their time of need.

137
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:34,751
As time went on,

138
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,240
he preferred to receive
letters rather than press.

139
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,150
It was probably much easier for
him to keep records this way.

140
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,290
Stories of cynics magic and generosity
began to spread throughout the rest of

141
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:44,920
the wells.

142
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,701
In the Netherlands,

143
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,810
Belgium and Switzerland.

144
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,020
Children began to leave the shoes
outside on Saint Nicholas Day,

145
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,350
so the to the Jolly Sinta class
could leave them presence.

146
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:53,891
Sure enough,

147
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:57,800
small toys and candy were left for them
when they work in the morning after the

148
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,880
Protestant reformation,

149
00:05:58,881 --> 00:05:59,551
Martin Luther,

150
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:02,780
I wanted to do away with the
stories of Catholic saints,

151
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:06,860
so he said that these presence were
actually coming from the baby Jesus or

152
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:07,910
Christ candle.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,110
People were confused,

154
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,471
of course,

155
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:12,950
because they knew that the real
gift giver was the Jolly old son,

156
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,281
Nick,

157
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,050
delivering the presence to these children.

158
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,860
So Christ Kendall was misunderstood
to be Kris Kringle Lens.

159
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,350
The nickname stock after
the revolutionary war,

160
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:25,310
there was a movement to reject many of
the English ways and start new traditions

161
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:28,910
the way uniquely American and author by
the name of Washington and I haven't had

162
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,750
already made a name for himself by
writing and publishing American folk tales

163
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,700
that had been told by word of mouth,

164
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,290
like Rip Van Winkle Lens,

165
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,330
the spooky legend of sleepy hollow.

166
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,130
This became a Halloween classic.

167
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,140
So when he heard about the
Dutch story of Sinterklaas see,

168
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,850
decided to officially give him the
properly American sounding name,

169
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,960
Santa Claus.

170
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,710
This is house and Nick officially
became a part of the American Christmas

171
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,520
tradition.

172
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,610
Either the next few hundred years the
public would learn more about Santa Claus

173
00:06:55,611 --> 00:07:00,320
then they had known before in 1809 I
haven't wrote in his book knickerbockers

174
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:04,250
history of New York about a surprising
Santa Siting in central park.

175
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,270
It read the good Saint Nicholas came
riding over the tops of the trees in that

176
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:09,530
selfsame wagon wearing.

177
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,570
He brings his yearly presence to children.

178
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,500
He went on to explain the sense it took
a break to smoke his pipe of tobacco

179
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,180
before getting that in his wagon.

180
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,170
Then flying away.

181
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,831
Fortunately,

182
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:19,551
as you might imagine,

183
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,230
modern sensor has given up smoking,

184
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,900
but he hasn't replaced it with
a serious cookie addiction,

185
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,020
so it's not exactly kind on
his ever expanding waistline.

186
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,400
As the years went on,

187
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,130
more and more writers would elaborate
with additional details and now sound to

188
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:32,660
goals.

189
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,920
In December of 1823 a writer named Clement
Clarke Moore was walking through the

190
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,810
snow on his way home under his arm.

191
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:42,050
He had a Christmas Darcie for his family
and looking around at the beautiful

192
00:07:42,051 --> 00:07:42,321
scene,

193
00:07:42,321 --> 00:07:44,390
he was suddenly inspired to write a poem.

194
00:07:44,391 --> 00:07:46,700
It titles of visit from Saint Nicholas,

195
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,060
but you probably know that as
the night before Christmas.

196
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,940
It was the night before Christmas
when all through the house,

197
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,710
not a creature was stirring,

198
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,150
not even a mouse.

199
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,300
The stockings were hung by the chimney
with pat and the hopes that Saint

200
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,760
Nicholas,

201
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,593
which soon

202
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,900
this became an incredibly popular poem.

203
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:09,860
It's so perfectly captured the Christmas
spirit so that in just a few years,

204
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,350
nearly every American
would know it by heart.

205
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,310
Instead of thinking of his time living
in Turkey as a fourth century St people.

206
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,330
Now Imagine Santa clause to be a chatty
jolly old man who climbed through the

207
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:24,530
chimney to place presence in stockings
and leave them wrapped up under the

208
00:08:24,531 --> 00:08:25,364
Christmas tree.

209
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,760
So I said Nick had always been a sailor
and as an avid traveler throughout his

210
00:08:28,761 --> 00:08:29,380
lifetime.

211
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,700
Now the gauging the open
sea is no easy task,

212
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:34,250
especially before the benefits of gps,

213
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,730
but he wants it to get around
on land at a much faster pace.

214
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,620
In 1921 and anonymous author wrote and
illustrated a story called old Santa

215
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,730
Claus with much delight.

216
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,320
For the first time the public learns
that center had upgraded his ride from a

217
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,450
rickety old wagon and is
a boat to a proper sled,

218
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,220
pulls by a single raindance.

219
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:57,150
In 1889 poet Katharine Lee
Bates introduced the world
to Mrs Clause and we got

220
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:57,421
to know,

221
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:59,550
and it's a bit more about
some next personal life.

222
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,490
We still don't know exactly
when they got married,

223
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,810
but this couple have what is probably
the longest lasting marriage in history.

224
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,720
We also don't know if they
ever had any children together.

225
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,940
As the years went on,

226
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,500
the public learns more about centers,

227
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:14,970
progress in his mission to
bring joy into the world.

228
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,020
We learned that he moved his new secret
hideouts to the North Pole and he hired

229
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:20,850
a team of elves to run his workshop.

230
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,940
We were introduced to his extended fleet
of eight magic reindeer and in 1939 he

231
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:29,750
added to the newest member of the
team Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

232
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:33,990
In 1891 even the presidents of the
United States was promoting Santa Claus.

233
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,760
Benjamin Harrison told the breasts,

234
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,600
we shall have an old fashioned Christmas
tree for the grandchildren upstairs and

235
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,700
I shall be the Santa Claus Myself.

236
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,410
That's me hope that my example will be
followed by every family and the land.

237
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,810
The very first video footage have captured
of Santa Claus was in 1898 by a film

238
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:52,860
maker named Je Ne Smith.

239
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,610
The wells could see him leaving presence
for sleeping children on Christmas Eve.

240
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,271
Of course,

241
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:00,050
as time went on and modern
technology improved,

242
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,270
more and more people were
capturing footage of Santa Claus.

243
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,870
It was finally time for him to come
out of hiding and make his first public

244
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:07,704
appearances.

245
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,110
Moving into the 20th century,

246
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:19,250
it sounds a clause was always hip to
the modern times during the industrial

247
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:19,791
revolution.

248
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:23,570
He was able to improve as operations with
as Elf employees working the assembly

249
00:10:23,571 --> 00:10:28,100
lines in his workshop at the North Pole
sound the game more like the CEO of his

250
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:28,970
toy empire,

251
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,580
making sure the operation
run as smoothly as possible.

252
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,530
Now that he wasn't
running as workshop alone,

253
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:37,730
he was finally able to make the time
to begin making public appearances.

254
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,020
In 1924 he decided to be a part of the
Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade in New

255
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,530
York City.

256
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,120
It received such a warm welcome from his
adoring fans that he decided to reapply

257
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,920
every single year ever since.

258
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,130
So long as the organizers meet the demand
on his ride or to provide him a tall

259
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:56,210
glass of milk and some warm chocolate
chip cookies in the green room in the

260
00:10:56,211 --> 00:10:59,630
1980s brought the boom of the shopping
mall in the United States and this began

261
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:03,770
the tradition of Santa Claus taking
personal requests from boys and girls.

262
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,790
There is even a massive party gold Sandvik
on held every year in New York City,

263
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,710
which isn't even a real convention.

264
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:13,490
It's just an excuse to dress a
and nick and party in the streets.

265
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,510
There is also the livable Santa Dash
and so many other events all around the

266
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,310
world that are thrown in is on that.

267
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,960
Moving into the 21st century,

268
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:25,100
modern technology has helped us truly
break down the science of just how center

269
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:25,851
manages to make.

270
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,540
As Jenny,

271
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,490
you can track some nicks progress on
Google maps is Santa Tracker and in 2016

272
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:35,720
the Mira did an intensive study of this
statistics of centers magical Jenny.

273
00:11:35,721 --> 00:11:36,554
On Christmas Eve.

274
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,930
They discovered that in order
for him to deliver presence,

275
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:41,270
you every single child in
the weld on a single night,

276
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:46,420
he would need to travel at
speeds of 1,280 miles per second.

277
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,860
Even though the world love Santa Claus,

278
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:53,590
that doesn't mean his legacy has been
free from controversy in he is often for

279
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,550
being at the root of making the holiday
season about material things rather than

280
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,550
having young people remember
the true meaning of Christmas.

281
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:02,870
Commercialism is a very
real thing of course,

282
00:12:02,871 --> 00:12:06,850
and there is no denying that Santa Claus
has helped sell billions of dollars in

283
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,810
products every holiday season
from Coca Cola to Barbie dolls,

284
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,200
let's say no wells where religion
and politics divide so many people.

285
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:18,460
There are very few things that Americans
agree on quite like the tradition of

286
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,294
Santa Clause.

287
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,290
Every December the 24th children go to
bed and they wake up at the crack of

288
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:23,800
dawn,

289
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,680
hoping they will find presence
underneath that Christmas tree.

290
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,281
For many.

291
00:12:27,281 --> 00:12:29,620
It's one of the very few
memories we all share rough.

292
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,850
Having faith in something
and the experience of
childhood wonder and it's the

293
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:35,110
belief in magic,

294
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:38,470
but sometimes it sends a close call and
do everything by himself and he needs to

295
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:40,270
recruit help in unexpected ways.

296
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,630
Just one example of this was
in 2011 a young couple names,

297
00:12:43,631 --> 00:12:47,380
Jim and Dylan moved into their new
apartments on West 22nd street in New York

298
00:12:47,381 --> 00:12:48,010
City.

299
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,370
Then they started to get letters in
their mailbox address to Santa Claus.

300
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,990
They thought it was a joke of course,

301
00:12:52,991 --> 00:12:55,810
and they went to the post office to see
if there was a forwarding address for

302
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:56,830
the previous tenants.

303
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,300
They were told that yes there was,

304
00:12:58,301 --> 00:13:01,300
but it was simply push as
the north pole that fast.

305
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:05,500
They didn't know what to do with these
letters and they had no idea how these

306
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:07,210
random children got their address.

307
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,310
They even 30 such for why on Google.

308
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,070
Eventually they decided that they
could not ignore these matters.

309
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,550
Many of them were heartbreaking matters
that came from underprivileged children,

310
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:16,720
Dylan and jammed against you,

311
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,660
parse out letters to their friends
and coworkers who all shared in the

312
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,940
responsibility of buying
presents for these kids.

313
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,600
Soon enough what spread on Facebook
and they were able to get hundreds of

314
00:13:25,601 --> 00:13:28,180
letters fulfilled by
kindhearted volunteers.

315
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,590
They now run a charity called miracle on
22nd street where anyone can volunteer

316
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:34,540
to help out with the letters to Santa.

317
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,240
If you're still unconvinced in
the existence of Santa Clause,

318
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:40,210
there are few words that can
better express the truth.

319
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:42,760
Then those are Francis for solace church.

320
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,430
In 1997 and an eight year
old girl named Virginia,

321
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:49,030
a Hanlon wrote to the New York Sun saying
that I have friends in school told her

322
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,650
that Santa Claus was not real.

323
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:54,700
She asked the church to tell her the
truth and they published this reply.

324
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:55,181
Yes,

325
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:55,690
Virginia,

326
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:56,800
there is a Santa Claus.

327
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,270
He exists is short or his generosity
and devotion exists and you know their

328
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,070
bounds and give to your life.

329
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,720
It's highest beauty and joy.

330
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:05,530
Alas,

331
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,530
how dreary the world would be without
to Santa Claus and just era biographics.

332
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,880
We want to say that Santa Claus does
exist as long as he's in our Haas and with

333
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:19,060
that very merry Christmas
and happy holidays.

334
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,060
Yup.
