6
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,720
Okay.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,740
Here's the only person who's baby picture
was flown into space and whose body

8
00:00:26,741 --> 00:00:29,470
has been preserved for
decades after his death.

9
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,670
He pushed his version of communism so
far and for so long that he was able to

10
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:38,230
overthrow the governments of the
largest country in the world. To some,

11
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,700
he's a hero to others.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:43,360
He is one of the most evil villains in
history and today's biographics graphics

13
00:00:43,361 --> 00:00:45,490
video.
We're talking about Vladimir Lenin,

14
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,320
the man behind the Bolshevik revolution
and the founder of the Soviet Union

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,970
via was 1870 and Vladimir Ilyich,

16
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,090
Oregon [inaudible] was born in a Russian
provincial town called Sim bisque.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,000
He would later grew up to be
known by his alias Vladimir Lenin.

18
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:09,180
Am I going to explain that later
in the video? Most revolutionaries,

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,960
they've got this tragic backstory.

20
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:15,420
If a young life of hardship rising
from the lower classes to demand better

21
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:19,410
treatments for the down trodden and many
people are taught that this is the case

22
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,370
with Lennon as well.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,510
They try to say that his parents were
descended from surfs and theirs have to

24
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:27,030
study hard to break into the middle class,

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:29,160
but the truth is that then ins patterns,

26
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:33,120
they were actually financially comfortable
and by all accounts he had a happy

27
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:34,680
childhood. His mother, Maria,

28
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,270
she was descended from a wealthy
Jewish family who is Swiss German,

29
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,590
so she taught him French
and German at home.

30
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,880
His father was the director of public
schools for the entire province.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,170
They were considered to be
hereditary nobility, yams.

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,360
They were far more educated than the
average Russian. This place does.

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,860
Parents in a group cools
the intelligentsia who would
debate over philosophy and

34
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,450
politics in their spare time.

35
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,480
Many of the members of the
intelligentsia became politicians.

36
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:04,290
You helped shape the new laws of the
nation while others devoted their life to

37
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,260
pushing for a Russian revolution.
Vladimir and his older brother, Alexander,

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,300
they wouldn't no exception. His brother
loves studying science in high school,

39
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:16,170
but there were no opportunities to
become a scientist in this small Russian

40
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:20,100
village. So Alexandra and moved to
Saint Petersburg to attend university.

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
During this time,
he joined a political study groupings.

42
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,000
They began to discuss the failures of
the Romanov Empire and they believe that

43
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,510
the only way to say of Russia
would be to remove them from power.

44
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,040
When he was 21 years olds,

45
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:36,720
Alexander joined a terrorist group who
attempted to assassinate saw Nicholas the

46
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,600
second with a homemade bomb,
the terrorists,

47
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,740
they were caught and Alexandra and his
friends, they were hanged for that crime.

48
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,970
Vladimir Lenin was 17 at the time that
his brother died and he was just about to

49
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,050
graduate from high school.

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,300
Even though we had gone through
such a shocking tragedy,

51
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,960
he still managed to become the
Valedictorian of his graduating class.

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,510
He went to law school with the
intention of becoming a lawyer,

53
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,800
but just a few months
into his first semester,

54
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:03,400
he joined the demonstration of students
who were protesting against the school

55
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:03,970
rules.

56
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,570
Soon as the Russian police were already
watching Lennon closely to see if he was

57
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,310
also a terrorist like his brother.

58
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,050
The school saw his participation in these
demonstrations as a sign that he might

59
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,760
cause a lot of trouble in the future,

60
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,660
so he was expelled and he decided
to educate himself instead.

61
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,810
The Song Nicholas,

62
00:03:26,811 --> 00:03:29,720
the seconds he released the peasant
class from their surf status,

63
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:33,920
meaning that they no longer have to be
indentured servants to wealthy landowners.

64
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,740
While this helps relieve the
difficulties of a lot of people,

65
00:03:36,741 --> 00:03:40,730
it wasn't really a perfect solution to
the problems that this hasn't passed.

66
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:41,960
We're facing people.

67
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,890
They were still in debt since many
struggles to just make ends meet.

68
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,330
The vast majority of people,

69
00:03:47,331 --> 00:03:52,130
they were illiterate and Russia was
decades behind in progress compared to the

70
00:03:52,131 --> 00:03:54,590
western world.
Many members of the intelligentsia,

71
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:58,130
they were unhappy with the way things
were going and wanted their country to

72
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:02,120
move forward with progress just like
the rest of the human race. Man.

73
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,320
He studied Laura at school,

74
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:07,310
but he realized that with his bad nerves
and his family's bad reputation from

75
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,630
his brother being a terrorist,

76
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,290
it would be impossible for him to get
a job as a lawyer. Vladimir Lenin,

77
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:16,580
he began his self education by reading
Karl Marx and other revolutionary writers.

78
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,130
He joined the Marxist Study
Group were intellectuals,

79
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:23,300
Matt and discussed philosophy and the
possibility of a Russian revolution.

80
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,930
It was around this time
that a major famine spread
throughout the lands near his

81
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:30,800
home records of the 1891 famine.
They vary drastically.

82
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:33,020
Some say that the way 300,000 deaths,

83
00:04:33,021 --> 00:04:37,820
while others say it was closer to
5 million people, then he was fine.

84
00:04:37,821 --> 00:04:40,940
Of course it's family. They were well off
as you had plenty of money to buy food,

85
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,630
but he also didn't nothing to aid
the people who were dying around him.

86
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,940
He was actually kind of happy about this,

87
00:04:46,941 --> 00:04:48,890
saying that the worst
things got in Russia,

88
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,050
the better it would ultimately become.

89
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,460
He knew that people needed to start dying
in the thousands before people would

90
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:59,360
be angry enough to want to revolution
call Mark's right that he believes an

91
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:03,620
industrialized society would be the most
likely to create a revolution because

92
00:05:03,621 --> 00:05:06,980
he believes that they'd want to
rise up against commercialism.

93
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,430
Vladimir Lenin rewrote a lot of
what Mark's was actually saying.

94
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:14,030
Lenin wrote the idea
that the revolutionary
intelligentsia will guide the

95
00:05:14,031 --> 00:05:15,170
uneducated peasants,

96
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:18,620
even though the philosophy was labeled
as Marxism all throughout the reign of

97
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:19,550
the Soviet Union,

98
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,700
it is now called Leninism because it
really was his own personal ideas and not

99
00:05:25,311 --> 00:05:26,450
those of Karl Marx.

100
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,290
Lenin joined a socialist group that
gained access to a factory there.

101
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,990
They started handing out
fliers to factory workers.

102
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,100
They weren't trying to make people angry
about their work situations and wanted

103
00:05:37,101 --> 00:05:39,800
them to demand shorter
hours and higher pay.

104
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,710
They were caught though because they
accidentally allowed a police informant

105
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:45,740
joining the group and they
were all arrested at this time,

106
00:05:45,741 --> 00:05:47,490
any form of revolutionary activity.

107
00:05:47,491 --> 00:05:50,660
It was taken very seriously and
they all had to serve jail time.

108
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:53,120
He was 26 years old at the time.
You went to prison,

109
00:05:53,121 --> 00:05:56,510
but there was nothing like what weird.
Imagine a Russian prison to be.

110
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,520
Since he descended from
a Nobel blood line,

111
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:01,880
he was given a very comfortable place
to live where he could wear whatever

112
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,920
clothes he wants,
his as well as read books,

113
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:06,860
and he also received a daily
visits from his family and friends.

114
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,850
He was even allowed to continue writing
his revolutionary pamphlets and essays

115
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,990
while he was behind bars for that very
activity. After just 14 months in jail,

116
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:19,160
he was exiled to Siberia for
three more years. In a way though,

117
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:20,840
this was actually a good move for him.

118
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,630
He was given a government pension
that covered his living expenses.

119
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,230
This meant he spent most of his time
meeting and writing about the revolution,

120
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:31,100
which is what he would be doing anyway,
so for him this time in Siberia,

121
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,790
it was more like a very long writer's
retreat and he was actually very

122
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,830
productive during his time away.
Indeed,

123
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:40,490
his girlfriend was also arrested
and sent to Siberia as well.

124
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:43,670
They got married there so that
they could live in exile together.

125
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,630
So Vladimir Lenin,

126
00:06:44,631 --> 00:06:48,470
he's raising these revolutionary ideas
in Siberia and he's sending them back to

127
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:51,860
a socialist friends who are publishing
his essays in a secret newspaper.

128
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,940
He made up a variety of different pen
names so that it seems like multiple

129
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:58,370
intellectuals were all pushing
for the same revolution,

130
00:06:58,371 --> 00:06:59,840
but really it was just him.

131
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,720
The bad name here eventually
stuck with was Vladimir Lenin,

132
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:07,130
which is what he is remembered us today
after being released from his time at

133
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:11,090
Exxon, he was 30 years old and he and
his wife moved to Munich, Germany,

134
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:15,020
where they could print revolutionary
newspapers in Russian without getting into

135
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:16,130
trouble with the German police.

136
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:19,460
He would then have the papers smuggled
into Russia with the help of fellow

137
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:21,800
revolutionaries who carried
them in their luggage.

138
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,750
One of these co-conspirators was a young
man named Joseph Stalin who was equally

139
00:07:26,751 --> 00:07:30,650
passionate about the coming revolution
and would eventually take Lennon's place.

140
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,110
Now, just before we get into
the next spot of Lennon's life,

141
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:35,600
I do want to mention
today's sponsor war thunder.

142
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,140
Thunder is a realistic free
to play vehicle combat game.

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,230
And I know that the advert in the
middle of the video is not ideal,

144
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:45,290
but we can do subjects
like this without sponsors.

145
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,650
This video has themes that
you advertising. Advertisers
just don't really like.

146
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:52,880
So without a sponsor we can't really pay
for it. So thank you for watching this

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,680
smell. This one says it's also free, it's
also a game. So that's also pretty great.

148
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,920
Now it always amazes me when I hear
that there aren't millions of players of

149
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:06,740
these online games, millions.
So it's a lot of people.

150
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,860
But then I can see why it's amazing
what games can do these days,

151
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:12,980
especially free games. It's free
to play. It looks incredible.

152
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:16,250
Just look at the footage we're
showing here. I mean, why not?

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,730
In this game there are over 1,200
historically accurate vehicles.

154
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,770
There are tanks,
aircraft ships,

155
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:25,070
incredible vehicles
from the 1930s onwards.

156
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,670
So this game is available
on PC ps four and Xbox one.

161
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,823
Rolling.

162
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,923
Yeah,

163
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,750
and most tellings of
the Russian revolution.

164
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:13,720
Vladimir London's rise to power
always seems very straight forward.

165
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,990
He is always depicted as a
well-respected intellectual.

166
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:19,480
He was able to rise to
power or missed immediately,

167
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:23,500
but that's pretty far from the truth
has revolution. It was a long process,

168
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:27,670
but he never gave up trying to
sliver his way into a place of power.

169
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,940
Vladimir Lenin, he had a real
talent for stirring up trouble.

170
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,360
Even among the intelligentsia, he would
call anyone who disagreed with him.

171
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:37,630
His enemies sends the
sniveling bourgeoisie,

172
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,970
even though they were all
middle class socialists.

173
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:43,480
He had absolutely no patience for
anyone who did not agree with him,

174
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,470
100% during one of their meetings to
discuss their strategies about the

175
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,161
revolution.

176
00:09:48,161 --> 00:09:53,140
He insulted some of the Socialists so
strongly that they got up and left while

177
00:09:53,141 --> 00:09:53,591
they were gone.

178
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:57,490
He declared that his ideals were the
Bolsheviks or the majority while everyone

179
00:09:57,491 --> 00:10:00,130
else was the Menshevik of
Air Corps minority party.

180
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:03,810
That a Bolshevik get stock from
that point on. So in 1904 let it,

181
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:07,330
and he gets a bit stressed out from
all of this debating and discussing his

182
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:10,240
philosophy as well as handing out
pamphlets and stuff like that.

183
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,740
Since he got rather real,

184
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,610
he decided to take it be a long hiking
holiday and the Swiss Alps with his wife,

185
00:10:15,611 --> 00:10:16,331
but the Bolsheviks,

186
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:20,830
they continued that own revolutionary
work while he was gone in 1905 there was a

187
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:24,040
peaceful protest in Saint Petersburg
and front of the Winter Palace.

188
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,490
People held up signs, pleading for
better working conditions, all the ones,

189
00:10:27,491 --> 00:10:29,080
it was an eight hour work day.

190
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,770
They even saying God saved the Sata
show that love and support for the royal

191
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:33,310
family,

192
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:36,700
but instead of listening to their requests
saw Nicholas the second ordered his

193
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:38,260
guards to shoot at the crowd.

194
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,580
Thousands of people died and it
became known as bloody Sunday people.

195
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,810
They were outraged in the,

196
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,810
began protesting for workers'
rights all across Russia.

197
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:51,370
When Lenin had the new c abruptly ended
his vacation in Switzerland and decided

198
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:54,970
to come back to Russia. He finally had
the opportunity that had been waiting for.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,600
He began to preach to people that they
needed to organize and take action

200
00:10:58,601 --> 00:10:59,440
against the sob.

201
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,130
He got that little too excited about the
idea of a bloody revolution and rotel.

202
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:05,650
They should pour hot acid
onto the royal gardens.

203
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,590
Got into specific details
of how to murder someone,

204
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,430
which was something that no
other revolution rewriter
had done before. However,

205
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:16,240
there was still not enough revolutionaries
willing to fight and kill people on

206
00:11:16,241 --> 00:11:18,600
Lennon's behalf.
Many of the Bolshevik revolution raise,

207
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,780
they were exiled to Siberia and Lennon
fled to Switzerland's before he could be

208
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:23,650
arrested too.

209
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,710
Then world war one rolls around and that
basically puts a damper on everyone's a

210
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,570
revolutionary plans.
Sonic lists.

211
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:32,590
The second d left some Petersburg
to join his man on the front lines.

212
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,730
This all also left his wife Alexandra
in the care of their spiritual advisor.

213
00:11:36,731 --> 00:11:38,730
Grigori rasp. Putin. Yep. Oh,

214
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,710
this men believed that he was
the second coming of Christ.

215
00:11:41,711 --> 00:11:44,850
Didn't believe that he had magical
healing powers given to him by God.

216
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,090
Many of the decisions that recipes
in made were harshly criticized,

217
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:51,210
like putting is unqualified
friends in powerful positions.

218
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,700
If you want to learn more about Ras
Poussin the way we did a video about him,

219
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:59,260
find a link to that below Lennon and
still continue to write about his

220
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:02,850
revolutionary ideas from Switzerland's
and encouraged soldiers do tell him that

221
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,970
guns against their officers during
the war was almost no one was actually

222
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:10,330
reading the underground newspapers
is except for the handful of active

223
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,020
Bolsheviks.

224
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,170
The vast majority of the Russian people
were eager to defend their country,

225
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:18,370
but the war, it was still a
disaster. Millions of people died.

226
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,450
Inflation ruined Russia's economy and
women were standing in long bread lines.

227
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,650
Saw Nicholas the second
renames and peaches bag to
Petrograd Grad as a symbol of

228
00:12:26,651 --> 00:12:28,990
his devotion to the
Russian people for years,

229
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,700
people that criticized the names and
Petersburg because it sounded too German

230
00:12:32,701 --> 00:12:35,830
nuns Petrograd whois much
more Russian sounding saw.

231
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,700
Nicholas believed this would somehow
prove his loyalty, but the gesture,

232
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,860
it just wasn't enough for the first time.

233
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,430
Thousands of Russian people were trained
in the military and they knew how to

234
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,930
use guns, soldiers and
police officers. Well,

235
00:12:47,931 --> 00:12:52,090
just as angry as the rest and people were
swarming the palace to take over from

236
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:55,720
the sauce all on their own Lennon
when he had nothing to do with it.

237
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,770
It wasn't even that he was
still in Switzerland and he
was panicking because the

238
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:01,960
revolution,
it was starting without him.

239
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,570
The political parties were
split into two groups.

240
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,340
The provisional government's which was
made up of the representative school,

241
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:08,920
the Duma and the workers,

242
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:13,060
Soviets who were controlled by the
trade unions and made up of the peasants

243
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,390
soldiers and factory work is letting
him knew that he was no match for the

244
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,880
provisional government's leader,
Alexander Kerensky.

245
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:21,730
He was a seasoned lawyer and
is a master of public speaking.

246
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:25,660
Kaminsky resonated with the tumor and
since Lennon was not actually a lawyer,

247
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,360
he knew that he would lose in
a political debate against him,

248
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,490
so therefore they then focus his efforts.

249
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:34,550
I'm trying to manipulate the lesser
educated workers. Soviets instead,

250
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,590
what are you arrived at the train station
then his friends with that degrees.

251
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,980
MNC hardly said hello before standing on
a pedestal to shout at the crowns that

252
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:45,430
they had to done an awful job with a
revolution and that it wasn't going to be

253
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:48,670
over until they took down the
provisional government's almost.

254
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,660
No one actually agreed with them and
they just carried on going about their

255
00:13:52,661 --> 00:13:56,110
business even as felt Bolsheviks and
they're longer wanted to print his essays

256
00:13:56,111 --> 00:13:58,210
because it was such an unpopular opinion.

257
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:01,720
The provisional government was leading
Russia back to war against Germany and

258
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:05,440
World War One. It was still going on, but
soldiers, they were not happy to serve.

259
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,380
It was the reason why that overthrowing
the siren in the first place.

260
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,100
People wanted the war to be over and
either abandoned their posts on the

261
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,680
battlefield or can keep you
refuse to go in the first place.

262
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,580
Then he tried to stand up again
and lead these crowds of peasants,

263
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:22,570
but someone from the
provisional government shouted
that he was a German spy.

264
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,450
This made the crown 10 against demons.
He had to run away.

265
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,750
Alexander Kerensky could see that he was
going to cause a lot of trouble for the

266
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:30,310
authority of the provisional government,

267
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,570
so he outlawed the existence of the
Bolshevik party Lenin. At this point,

268
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,280
he needed to escape. He was
on a bad wig, shaved his bids,

269
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:39,910
and Gus on the next train
to Finland's Vladimir Lenin.

270
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:42,550
He spent a very long time
hiding on a finish farm,

271
00:14:42,551 --> 00:14:45,400
continuing to write his ideas
and send them back to Russia.

272
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:49,450
Since no one was actually listening
to him or agreeing with his ideas,

273
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:51,920
he decided to take Russia by force.

274
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,790
One night in October of 1917 he snuck
back into Russia and met up with his

275
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,800
comrades in Petrograd.
By this time,

276
00:14:57,801 --> 00:15:00,770
he had convinced more members of
the Worker's Party to join us site.

277
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,640
He convinced his Bolshevik followers of
the red guards to break into the Windsor

278
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,690
Palace for a cuter top.

279
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,600
They captured members of the
provisional government's at gun points.

280
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:11,210
The dream that they were arrested,
taken to jail,

281
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,950
and Vladimir Lenin became the new leader
of Russia without ever being voted in

282
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,360
Bladimir and address the
crowd of Russian peasants.

283
00:15:24,361 --> 00:15:27,990
That morning after storming the winter
palace and introduced himself as the new

284
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:30,840
dictator and as the leader
of the Soviet Union,

285
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:35,070
Lenin promised them exactly what they
wanted and he did it in the simplest words

286
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,950
possible peace, bread, and land.

287
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,280
One of his first acts as leader
was to bends the war with Germany.

288
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:44,730
People were happy because that's exactly
what they wanted all along right from

289
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:45,151
the beginning,

290
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,960
he isolated himself at the Kremlin in
Moscow so that he could continue writing

291
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,950
the Bolshevik party.

292
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:54,720
They wasted no time in
spreading propaganda that
Vladimir Lenin was like a kind

293
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,380
old grandfather who only wanted the best
for the Russian people and that they

294
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:02,460
didn't have to worry about anything
anymore. Everything was going to be fine.

295
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:06,810
Old granddaddy Lennon was going to
take care of you. In reality, though,

296
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,370
he was blood thirsty and he wanted his
revolution to be as violent as possible.

297
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,240
He told tenants to kill their landlords
and encouraged violence against the

298
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:17,130
upper classes.
He gave out the orders.

299
00:16:17,131 --> 00:16:20,790
Who has read a gone to remove the
Romanov royal family from the palace.

300
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:21,511
At that time,

301
00:16:21,511 --> 00:16:26,511
the number of men who joined in Lennon's
red guard had grown to 200,000 and he

302
00:16:26,671 --> 00:16:30,180
had a small army to stand behind him.
Many of the Russian people,

303
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,530
they protested because
they love the Romanovs,

304
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,590
especially the young children at first.

305
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:37,410
Then in lied saying that they
would be kept somewhere safe,

306
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,380
but once he realized that they were
too much of a threat to his power,

307
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,270
he ordered their execution. Since
the family was being held in Siberia,

308
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:47,550
it took a very long time for the public
to learn about their deaths. At first,

309
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,320
people will leave.
There was just saw Nicholas,

310
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:51,660
he was killed and that the
women and children were spared.

311
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:56,160
It would take years for the public
to learn the truth of his brutality.

312
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,580
He proclaims that every Russian
citizens should have good rations,

313
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:00,600
but in order to do that,

314
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:03,030
the farms would have to be
controlled by the governments.

315
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,130
Farmers Web not allowed to keep or sell
the food they grew and all of the crop

316
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:09,450
swept spread out among the entire nation.

317
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,810
People could no longer choose their
jobs and were given employments in newly

318
00:17:12,811 --> 00:17:15,720
constructed factory is based on
the needs of the country. Now,

319
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:19,200
some people were happy about this and it
gave them a sense of security. Indeed,

320
00:17:19,201 --> 00:17:22,140
statues of Lenin were erected
around Petra grandsons.

321
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,800
Many people called him a hero. Now not
everyone was drinking Landon's Koolaid,

322
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:29,340
though plenty of people were furious
with him for ordering the death of the

323
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,510
innocent Rehmann off children.

324
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,440
In 1918 a woman named Fanya Kaplan
attempted to assassinate London.

325
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,710
She shot him twice at close range.
Now he was seriously injured,

326
00:17:37,711 --> 00:17:39,540
but he still managed to survive.

327
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,110
Poplin was arrested and she refused
to give up the name of any of our co

328
00:17:43,111 --> 00:17:46,530
conspirators. She was executed
in September of that same, yeah,

329
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,870
then it would recover from
his injuries in the hospital,

330
00:17:48,871 --> 00:17:52,890
but from that day forward he showed no
mercy to anyone who expressed even the

331
00:17:52,891 --> 00:17:55,260
smallest opposition to this rule.

332
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,370
Even though he always encouraged the
peasant class to stand up for their rights

333
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:02,940
and rebel against that government.
It was no longer okay to do so.

334
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:04,590
Once that was his government,

335
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,100
anytime peasants or farmers trying
to protest against his new rules,

336
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:10,230
they were killed without mercy.

337
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,680
Those who oppose London didn't
go down without a fight. Though.

338
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:17,670
In 1918 a group called the white army
battled against the Red Army and a civil

339
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,580
war fighting to take down
the Soviet Union. However,

340
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:24,300
the white army was not organized
very well and they lost the war.

341
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:28,350
In 1928 farmers were angry that their
green was being stolen from them for the

342
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,150
greater good of the communist nation.

343
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,700
This began what is known
as the tumble of rebellion,

344
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,610
but they were all gassed
by the Red Army runs.

345
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,380
Their crops were taken
away from their dead hands.

346
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,220
At least 50,000 people were in town,
mostly women, children and the elderly.

347
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,560
Some of them sent to campsis hostages.

348
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:47,220
There were several other incidents like
this and any rebellion among the Russian

349
00:18:47,221 --> 00:18:48,930
people.
It was quickly squashed.

350
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,830
Even after trying to make as political
philosophy work through threats of death

351
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:53,664
and destruction,

352
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,780
Lennon knew wind call quince when millions
of people were on the brink of dying

353
00:18:57,781 --> 00:18:58,920
from drought and famine.

354
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,520
He does something he did to temporarily
stop communism and allowed farmers to

355
00:19:02,521 --> 00:19:06,430
keep the food that they planted and sell
the access food for profit. You know,

356
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,740
that's something called capitalism. And
surprisingly, this was a huge success.

357
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,460
People were no longer starving and
the economy improved once things had

358
00:19:14,461 --> 00:19:18,210
stabilized again, Lenny went back to
forcing food rations. Unfortunately,

359
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,050
not every leader who followed in London's
footsteps knew when to take a break

360
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,850
from communism during a time of famine.

361
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,270
Lennon success of Joseph Stalin would
be remembered as one of the worst

362
00:19:27,271 --> 00:19:30,010
dictators who ever lived
for this very reason.

363
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,553
Right

364
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,520
when he was in his 50s Vladimir Lennon's
health began to decline and he had

365
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:42,190
multiple strokes.
But even when he was in poor health,

366
00:19:42,191 --> 00:19:45,250
he was trying to write in his journal
to give commands from his bed.

367
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:49,420
When he dies in 1924 people were shocked
as they were not expecting him to die.

368
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,450
So young hundreds of thousands of
people showed up to his funeral,

369
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,140
even though it was below
freezing temperatures, people
were sobbing, upset. This,

370
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,780
the one man who truly
cared about them was gone.

371
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,990
He did manage to make some improvements
in the economy and so there was so much

372
00:20:01,991 --> 00:20:04,210
pro Lennon propaganda
that had been circulated.

373
00:20:04,211 --> 00:20:06,790
The people believe that
he truly was their savior.

374
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,500
Five days after learning passed away,

375
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:11,580
the city of Petrograd was
renamed Leningrad in his honor.

376
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,790
His body was embalmed so that people
could continue to visit him and pay their

377
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,010
respects.
That Amir Lennon's reputation,

378
00:20:18,011 --> 00:20:20,470
it only became more
powerful after his death.

379
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,250
He was like a legend who manage to change,
not just Russia,

380
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,620
but several other countries
throughout the world.

381
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,860
Communist leaders looked at him for
inspiration on how to run their own

382
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,450
dictatorships.
The USSR,

383
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:35,170
it continued for decades after his
death and despite all of its setbacks,

384
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:40,090
the system led to more
progress than Russia had seen
an hundreds of years before

385
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:41,950
Lennon.
The country was very far behind.

386
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:44,920
The rest of the Western world
in terms of industrialization,

387
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,020
education and modernization.

388
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,320
If it were not for all of the
reforms made by the Soviet Union,

389
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,220
they may have never gotten so far with
the space race against the United States,

390
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,860
and they still might be lagging behind.
Today,

391
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:01,150
in 1991 the Soviet Union collapsed
and all of the statues of Lennon,

392
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:03,550
they were torn down.
Instead of seeing him as a hero,

393
00:21:03,551 --> 00:21:07,210
he has now remembered as a villain.
Lennon grants became Saint Petersburg.

394
00:21:07,211 --> 00:21:07,960
Once again,

395
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,500
there is no telling how far the nation
would have progressed if it were not for

396
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:14,440
the creation of the Soviet Union.
But one thing is for sure,

397
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,340
without Vladimir Lenin, the world
would be a very different place today.

398
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,790
